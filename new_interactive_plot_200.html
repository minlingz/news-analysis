However, tensions have escalated under the current Philippine government, suggesting that the Philippines is provoking conflicts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. **Forming Alliances Outside ASEAN**: He Lei criticized the Philippines for forming military alliances with the US, Japan, and Australia, and conducting joint military exercises, which he argued undermines ASEAN's centrality and violates the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4. **Resolution of Disputes**: He emphasized that the resolution of South China Sea disputes and the maintenance of peace should be managed by regional countries and ASEAN, not by external powers, which he accused of instigating and exacerbating the issues.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe press briefing highlighted China's stance against external interference and its call for regional solutions to the South China Sea disputes."],["The article discusses the recent visit of U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo to the Philippines, where she led a high-level trade and investment delegation.

Raimondo announced over $1 billion in investments from 22 U.S. companies, including Microsoft, Google, and United Airlines, which will create thousands of jobs and boost sectors like cybersecurity, AI, and tourism in the Philippines.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe visit aligns with the U.S. strategy to support its allies in the Indo-Pacific region, including Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines, against Chinese expansion. The Philippines, under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., has shifted from the previous administration's pro-China stance to seeking stronger ties with the U.S. and other allies. This shift was accelerated by aggressive actions from China, such as using laser beams against Philippine vessels in the South China Sea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn response to China's economic and military pressure, the Philippines has sought investments and security agreements with other countries, including Japan, South Korea, and India.
