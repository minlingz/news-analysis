        "title": "Microsoft Responds to Reports of Its China's AI Team's Relocation to the U.S.",
        "body": "Recently, the news that several groups from Microsoft's Azure AI team in China collectively relocated to the United States and Australia has attracted widespread attention.\n\nOn May 15, Microsoft responded to reporters, stating that only a small number of employees currently have the opportunity to choose international rotation. Employees can choose to accept the rotation or continue to work in their current positions. The previous rumors of \"collective relocation to the U.S.\" were exaggerated and inaccurate.\n\nAccording to previous speculations, Microsoft headquarters sent an email notifying multiple AI research teams in the China region, such as the C+AI team and the Azure ML team, which work on AI platforms, to relocate to the United States or Australia. This move could involve hundreds of employees, who need to make a decision by June 7. They could also choose to take severance compensation, and Microsoft US can assist with family visas. However, an insider at Microsoft stated, \"As far as I know, some employees have received optional internal transfer opportunities\", and the adjustments \"do not affect domestic operations.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella announced that Microsoft will invest $2.2 billion in Malaysia over the next four years to build cloud computing and AI computing infrastructure (data centers), and provide AI skills training for 200,000 people. It is said to be Microsoft's largest investment in Malaysia. Prior to this, Microsoft's data centers in Southeast Asia were mainly established in Singapore.\n\nAt Microsoft's Asia Research Institute, the company does not allow Chinese researchers to use the GPT-4 beta and core technologies in advance. At the same time, the company has also restricted the institute's research work in quantum computing, facial recognition, and synthetic media. However, at the branch in Vancouver, researchers can freely access key technologies, including the computing power and OpenAI systems required for cutting-edge research.",

Mistral was reportedly speaking to investors about raising hundreds of millions of dollars in its next funding round, and was seeking a $5 billion valuation earlier this year.\n\nIn February, Mistral and Microsoft announced a multi-year, $16.3 million partnership focused on commercializing the startup's flagship models and scaling up its AI development and deployment. Mistral's large language models (LLMs) are available on Microsoft's Azure AI platform, giving the startup more opportunity to promote, sell, and distribute its models to customers around the world.\n\nThe startup, which was founded a year ago by former DeepMind and Meta AI researchers, has recently started generating revenue, The Information reported in April. Mistral did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe billions of dollars being invested in AI startups, which in turn is leading to multi-billion dollar valuations, has created skeptics warning of a tech stock bubble reminiscent of the dot-com bubble which burst in 2000. However, experts told Quartz the two bubbles are different, and fears of a bubble burst are short-sighted.\n\nArthur Mensch, Mistral's chief executive, has said the startup wants to take on the tech titans of Silicon Valley.\n\n\"We want to be the most capital-efficient company in the world of AI,\" Mensch told the Wall Street Journal. \"That's the reason we exist.\"",

        "body": "As a distinguished engineer working on the Microsoft Azure AI Search team, Pablo Castro has insight into the inner workings of generative AI, AI search, and the approach that Microsoft is taking to build these systems with its developer ecosystem in mind.\n\nSpeaking on a new episode of the Shift AI Podcast, Castro mentions three trends he's excited about in these areas.\n\nCastro also hints at upcoming developments from Microsoft.\n\n\"We've been working hard on the state-of-the-art systems for removing all these concerns around the cost of scale,\" he says. \"You'll see us, very soon, talk about a complete shift in the level of scale you can achieve with our retrieval systems for generative AI apps, and a huge improvement in economics.\"\n\nOne of Castro's goals, he says, is to ensure that economic concerns don't limit the amount of data that people apply to artificial intelligence models.\n\nHe also cites some specific areas of focus for Microsoft's Azure AI platform this year:\n\nThose are some of the insights from Castro in this episode of Shift AI, a show that explores what it takes to adapt to the changing workplace in the digital age of remote work and AI. We also discuss his early days at Microsoft and explore his role leading the Azure AI team in the discovery of how best to integrate Gen-AI and AI search into business operations.\n\nListen below, and continue reading for highlights from his comments, edited for context and clarity. Subscribe to the Shift AI Podcast and hear more episodes at ShiftAIPodcast.com.\n\nRole at Microsoft Azure AI: Today I'm spending a lot of time at the intersection of these language models and knowledge. So the question that we tackle with my team is, in a world where you have these language models that are effectively reasoning engines that are very clever, but they don't know about the stuff that you need them to know about, and we have lots of data, but it's separated from these models, how do you put them together? That intersection is critical in terms of applying all this fascinating technology to business problems. It's also, frankly, a lot of fun because it mixes these language modeling problems with knowledge representation problems. How do we integrate these things? How do we take advantage of the strengths of each of these pieces of technology? We've been spending a lot of time in this space.\n\nA 'tight learning loop': The last 18 months, maybe a little longer, have been a blur. So many of our customers are doing things with Azure OpenAI, and Azure AI Search, and the rest of the Azure AI platform. We've learned a ton from people taking this technology and using it for real problems, real business priorities. So that has been fascinating. But also, it's been a learning opportunity. It's very humbling when all these people are excited about the thing that you're offering, and then they go to use it, and they're like, \"Well, we couldn't because this didn't work, or this is not what I thought.\" So we're in this very tight learning loop.\n\nThe state of AI in 2024: If I look at 2023, I feel it was the year of demos and proofs of concept, where this was so new. All of us wanted to see what it felt like to build one of these things, and everyone took their business problem and gave it a try. It is clear that 2024 is the year all of these things are going to production. So the challenges shift from, \"How do I get this off the ground and try one or the other thing?\" to \"How do I do this securely? How do I know that this integration is going to work well over time?\" We're going to add multiple orders of magnitude in scale. And what does that mean for the systems that are powering these? And do they scale the way you think they will, and would not? I always think about the things we can do for our customers to remove problems for them, so that they can think about the things only they can do because they have the context of their own business.\n\nAI data and security: One of the top questions I hear from customers is, \"Well, but no matter what I do with data management, at some point I'm going to take the question and instructions and the grounding information, and I'm going to send it to Azure OpenAI. So you are going to see the data. Are you going to train on that? Are you going to learn from it?\" And we made it a point to have a very short and crisp answer, which is, no. We don't train on customer data. We don't learn from that data. We don't use it to improve the models. In fact, we don't keep it.\n\nThe future of work: I'm not a marketing person and I don't understand many of the choices that we make, but whoever coined Copilot as the thing for Microsoft, they had a very good day. That's exactly how I think about this current wave of technology. There are these kinds of extensions of your brain that can help you do things that it would not have been practical to do otherwise, while still factoring human ingenuity in the picture.",

        "body": "In a first, Microsoft has provided United States intelligence agencies with a generative AI model, that's isolated/disconnected from the internet, to enable analysis of classified and top-secret information, according to a report by Bloomberg.\n\nAccording to the report, Microsoft's special product for the US spy agencies is a GPT 4-based model and is supported onto a cloud with an \"air-gapped\" environment that is isolated from the internet. This is to prevent risks that the sensitive information could leak into the open or potentially get hacked if intelligence agencies use large language models that rely on cloud services to examine data.\n\nThe generative AI model is on a special network that's only accessible by the US government, Microsoft's Chief Technology Officer William Chappell said to Bloomberg. He further explained that the GPT-4 model placed in the cloud is static, i.e. it can read files, but not learn from them or the open internet. This allows the government to keep the model clean, preventing secret information from getting absorbed into the platform.\n\nGPT-4 is a generative AI language model developed by OpenAI and is trained on Microsoft Azure AI supercomputers. In 2023, Microsoft had announced greater investments in OpenAI's research and development of AI systems in exchange for using such technology across its products. GPT-4 is considered to be \"more reliable, creative, and able to handle much more nuanced instructions than GPT-3.5.\"\n\nAccording to OpenAI, like previous models, GPT-4 has the tendency to \"hallucinate\" facts and make reasoning errors. MediaNama has reported earlier that it also lacks knowledge of events after September 2021 and does not learn from its experience. Further, it can sometimes make simple reasoning errors or be extremely gullible in accepting obvious false statements from a user. It can also fail at hard problems such as introducing security vulnerabilities into the code it produces. Another issue is that GPT-4 can be confidently wrong in its predictions as it does not double-check its work.\n\nThe acquisition of a new AI tool for boosting spying operations of US agencies comes at a time when the US Senate is set to vote on the Reforming Intelligence and Securing America Act (RISAA) that allows surveillance of non-Americans without a warrant. The bill reauthorises section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) that allows the American government to conduct surveillance on foreign citizens through, \"electronic communications service providers.\" This means that US businesses providing services such as e-mails, phone calls, text messages, etc. are required to assist the government in intercepting communication.\n\nAdditionally, the US military has also been using AI for the creation of new cybersecurity tools to secure critical infrastructure, for combat testing, research and for developing AI-powered autonomous vehicles among other purposes.\n\nThese developments raise concerns about the data of Indian citizens. The RISAA, if implemented, expands the scope of US surveillance over foreign citizens' data. In addition to data accessed through electronic communication service providers, by now US AI companies like OpenAI have already accessed a large amount of publicly available data of users across the world. This adds to the data trove of US spy agencies to snoop on Indian citizens' use of AI as well.\n\nAs MediaNama Founder-Editor Nikhil Pahwa had pointed out earlier, generative AI can be used for analysing large datasets to detect and identify vulnerabilities and strategies for cyberattacks. It is also important to note that India's data protection law does not govern publicly available personal data. This means publicly available personal data of Indian citizens can possibly be used for AI training, surveillance, and other purposes which can potentially impact people's rights to privacy and security.\n\nFurther, given the limitations of GPT4 discussed above, it's not known whether there's an oversight system to examine the output generated by the model. Notably, the US government's latest memorandum ensuring accountability of use of AI in governance exempts law enforcement agencies and sensitive law enforcement information. Emphasising the growing reliance of US intelligence on AI for surveillance measures and for determining threat actors to national security, the American Civil Liberties Union stated in its response to the memo, that these agencies are not bound by specific rules or safeguards for their AI systems, as well as clear processes for enforcement of rules. It added that exceptions for \"sensitive law enforcement\" information may end up undermining the memo.",

The combination of these objectives will significantly accelerate our free cashflow per share and deliver enhanced shareholder value.

These non-GAAP financial measures include Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA attributable to WELL Shareholders/Non-controlling interests, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income Per Share, and Adjusted Free Cash Flow. The Company believes these supplementary financial measures reflect the Company's ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in its business.\n\nAdjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin\n\nThe Company defines Adjusted Gross Profit as revenue less cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) and Adjusted Gross Margin as adjusted gross profit as a percentage of revenue. Adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin should not be construed as an alternative for revenue or net income (loss) determined in accordance with IFRS. The Company does not present gross profit in its consolidated financial statements as it is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company believes that adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin are meaningful metrics that are often used by readers to measure the Company's efficiency of selling its products and services.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\nThe Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization less (i) net rent expense on premise leases considered to be finance leases under IFRS and before (ii) transaction, restructuring, and integration costs, time-based earn-out expense, change in fair value of investments, share of income (loss) of associates, foreign exchange gain/loss, and stock-based compensation expense, and (iii) gains/losses that are not reflective of ongoing operating performance. The Company considers Adjusted EBITDA to be a financial metric that measures cash flow that the Company can use to fund working capital requirements, service future interest and principal debt repayments and fund future growth initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss), cash flow from operating activities or other measures of financial performance defined under IFRS.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA attributable to WELL Shareholders/Non-controlling interests\n\nThe Company defines Adjusted EBITDA attributable to WELL Shareholders (or Shareholder EBITDA) and Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Non-controlling interests as the sum of the Adjusted EBITDA for each relevant legal entity multiplied by WELL's or the non-controlling interests' equity ownership, respectively.\n\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Share\n\nThe Company defines Adjusted Net Income as net income (loss), after excluding the effects of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, time-based earnout expense, change in fair value of investments, non-controlling interests, and revenue precluded from recognition under IFRS 15 that relates to certain patient services revenue that the Company believes should be recognized as revenue based on its contractual relationships. Adjusted Net Income Per Share is Adjusted Net Income divided by weighted average number of shares outstanding. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to analyze our results, enhance a reader's understanding of past financial performance and allow for greater understanding with respect to key metrics used by management in decision making. More specifically, the Company believes Adjusted Net Income is a financial metric that tracks the earning power of the business that is available to WELL shareholders.\n\nAdjusted Free Cashflow\n\nThe Company defines Adjusted Free Cashflow as Adjusted EBITDA Attributable to Shareholders, less cash interest, less cash taxes and less capital expenditures.\n\nAdjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA attributable to WELL Shareholders/Non-controlling interests, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income Per Share, and Adjusted Free Cash Flow are not recognized measures for financial statement presentation under IFRS and do not have standardized meanings. As such, these measures may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies and should be considered as supplements to, and not as substitutes for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with IFRS.\n\nTotal Care Interactions are defined as Total Visits plus Technology Interactions plus Billed Provider Hours.

These non-GAAP financial measures include Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA attributable to WELL Shareholders/Non-controlling interests, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income Per Share, and Adjusted Free Cash Flow. The Company believes these supplementary financial measures reflect the Company's ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in its business.\n\nAdjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin\n\nThe Company defines Adjusted Gross Profit as revenue less cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) and Adjusted Gross Margin as adjusted gross profit as a percentage of revenue. Adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin should not be construed as an alternative for revenue or net income (loss) determined in accordance with IFRS. The Company does not present gross profit in its consolidated financial statements as it is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company believes that adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin are meaningful metrics that are often used by readers to measure the Company's efficiency of selling its products and services.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\nThe Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization less (i) net rent expense on premise leases considered to be finance leases under IFRS and before (ii) transaction, restructuring, and integration costs, time-based earn-out expense, change in fair value of investments, share of income (loss) of associates, foreign exchange gain/loss, and stock-based compensation expense, and (iii) gains/losses that are not reflective of ongoing operating performance. The Company considers Adjusted EBITDA to be a financial metric that measures cash flow that the Company can use to fund working capital requirements, service future interest and principal debt repayments and fund future growth initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss), cash flow from operating activities or other measures of financial performance defined under IFRS.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA attributable to WELL Shareholders/Non-controlling interests\n\nThe Company defines Adjusted EBITDA attributable to WELL Shareholders (or Shareholder EBITDA) and Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Non-controlling interests as the sum of the Adjusted EBITDA for each relevant legal entity multiplied by WELL's or the non-controlling interests' equity ownership, respectively.\n\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Share\n\nThe Company defines Adjusted Net Income as net income (loss), after excluding the effects of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, time-based earnout expense, change in fair value of investments, non-controlling interests, and revenue precluded from recognition under IFRS 15 that relates to certain patient services revenue that the Company believes should be recognized as revenue based on its contractual relationships. Adjusted Net Income Per Share is Adjusted Net Income divided by weighted average number of shares outstanding. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to analyze our results, enhance a reader's understanding of past financial performance and allow for greater understanding with respect to key metrics used by management in decision making. More specifically, the Company believes Adjusted Net Income is a financial metric that tracks the earning power of the business that is available to WELL shareholders.\n\nAdjusted Free Cashflow\n\nThe Company defines Adjusted Free Cashflow as Adjusted EBITDA Attributable to Shareholders, less cash interest, less cash taxes and less capital expenditures.\n\nAdjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA attributable to WELL Shareholders/Non-controlling interests, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income Per Share, and Adjusted Free Cash Flow are not recognized measures for financial statement presentation under IFRS and do not have standardized meanings. As such, these measures may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies and should be considered as supplements to, and not as substitutes for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with IFRS.\n\nTotal Care Interactions are defined as Total Visits plus Technology Interactions plus Billed Provider Hours.\n\nWELL HEALTH TECHNOLOGIES CORP.\n\nPer: \"Hamed Shahbazi\"\n\nHamed Shahbazi\n\nChief Executive Officer, Chairman and Director\n\nAbout WELL Health Technologies Corp.\n\nWELL's mission is to tech-enable healthcare providers.
