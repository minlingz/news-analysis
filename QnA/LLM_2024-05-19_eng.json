        "body": "Iranian protesters have expressed \"joy\" over the death of President Ebrahim Raisi who was dubbed the \"Butcher of Tehran\".\n\nSpeaking to Sky News' The World With Yalda Hakim, three Iranians spoke on the condition of anonymity over fears of being tracked down by the country's regime.\n\nA protest leader - who is currently in hiding - suggested Sunday's crash, that also killed Iran's foreign minister, was \"pre-planned\".\n\n\"We may not be across everything, but it's been a known fact for a long time that Raisi was a serious contender to replace the Supreme Leader Khamenei, and perhaps some didn't want that to happen.\n\n\"But all in all, this was very good news.\n\n\"All I can say is that the only thing that has made me truly happy over the past five years has been the news of Raisi's death.\"\n\nMr Raisi's time in charge included major protests over Mahsa Amini - the woman who died after she was arrested for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly.\n\nThe US said Mr Raisi had \"blood on his hands\" as the former hardline cleric was \"a brutal participant in the repression of the Iranian people for nearly four decades\".\n\nIran also took the unprecedented decision in April to launch a drone and missile attack on Israel.\n\nA 23-year-old student - who has taken part in a number of protests - said: \"The death of Raisi has made the people of Iran very happy.\n\n\"On the streets, people were handing out sweets, they were smiling at each other.\n\n\"That's the extent to which this news has spread joy amongst people.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nWho was hardliner Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi?\n\n'Butcher of Tehran' had fearsome reputation - many will fear instability\n\nA housewife, who was beaten up for taking parting in the \"Woman, Life, Protest\" movements, said: \"The public hatred towards this regime is not a secret to anyone.\n\n\"Raisi's death proved that the pain that this inflicted on our people will one day hit them back.\n\n\"My personal reaction to the death of Raisi... I was very happy.\n\n\"I'm not upset at all. Even though I never wish death on anyone, but this man, not only did he not do anything for our nation, but he ordered the death of countless young innocent people.\"\n\nFollowing news of Mr Raisi's death, US State department spokesperson Matt Miller said the Iranian president \"was involved in numerous horrific human rights abuses, including playing a key role in the extra judicial killing of thousands of political prisoners in 1988\".\n\n\"Some of the worst human rights abuses occurred during his tenure as president, especially the human rights abuses against the women and girls of Iran,\" he added.\n\nThe US approach to Iran \"will not change\" because of Mr Raisi's death, Mr Miller said.",

        "title": "The mysterious 'survivor' from Iranian president's fatal crash | WND | by Lt. Col. James Zumwalt",
        "body": "On Sunday, May 19, a helicopter transporting Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, 63, Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, the governor of Iran's East Azerbaijan province and other officials, along with their bodyguards, crashed.\n\nThe incident occurred in the mountainous East Azerbaijan province situated in the northeast part of the country. Raisi was returning to Tehran after attending a dedication ceremony for a newly constructed dam on the Aras River jointly built by Azerbaijan and Iran along their border - two nations not particularly close since Azerbaijan maintains diplomatic relations with Iran's sworn enemy in the region: Israel.\n\nWhile recovery efforts were hampered both by a thick forest along with heavy fog and snow, the victims' bodies were located. If an airborne helicopter experiences mechanical problems, there is no gliding to the ground as it normally falls like a rock to earth. It appears that is the fate Raisi's aircraft suffered as reportedly there were no survivors - or were there? It appears there may have been at least one unreported survivor. To better understand the survivor's identity, one must first understand who Raisi was and what he represented to his people.\n\nDespite winning the presidential election in 2021, Raisi was an unpopular candidate and for good reason.\n\nNo one runs for the office without the blessing of the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 85, and Raisi had that blessing. However, the Supreme Leader simply culled the herd of opposing presidential candidates to ensure Raisi had no real competition. The people recognized the election was rigged, consequently generating the lowest voter turnout since the mullahs took power in 1979. As a hard-liner, it was believed Raisi was being groomed by an ailing Khamenei to replace him.\n\nBut Raisi's lack of popularity cut deep. In 1988, those opposed to the regime took to the streets in protest. The mullahs clamped down on the opposition mercilessly, turning those streets red with their blood. An estimated 5,000 political prisoners were summarily executed. Raisi was one of four judges who presided over those executions in which some lives were decided by a vote, not unlike the Roman emperors of old judging the fate of gladiators by means of a thumbs up or thumbs down.\n\nInterestingly, in January of this year, a prominent list of people that included U.N. judges and investigators finally called for an investigation of the 1988 massacre to include Raisi's actions. The U.S. had already acted in 2019 to sanction Raisi \"for his administrative oversight over the executions of individuals who were juveniles at the time of their crime and the torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment of prisoners in Iran, including amputations.\" In his first news conference as president-elect, Raisi - lacking any sense of guilt - told reporters he should be praised for his 1988 actions in defending the security of the people.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Raisi's popularity, even as president, continued its downward spiral. Additional protests erupted in 2022 when a Kurdish Iranian woman - Marsha Amini, 22 - died in custody three days after being arrested for failing to comply with the country' headscarf mandate. This triggered more protests that led to at least 500 deaths and 22,000 arrests. The U.N. quickly conducted an investigation that found Iran responsible for the \"physical violence\" leading to Amini's death.\n\nWith the announcement of Raisi's death, the only tears being shed by the Iranian people are tears of joy as they rejoice over the loss. It is no wonder based on Raisa's bona fides as a brutal religious leader.\n\nThere may be a bit of good news concerning how the U.S. might have inadvertently played a role in Raisi's death. While Iran uses a variety of helicopters, its military fleet predominantly dates back to before the mullahs 1979 rise to power. The implementation of international sanctions against Iran, led by the U.S., has made it extremely difficult for the country to obtain replacement parts. Who knows if an Iranian helicopter mechanic, in need of but lacking such a critical part, decided he could get one more round trip out of Raisi's helicopter by using an obsolete part?\n\nWho then was the mystery passenger onboard Raisi's helicopter who survived the crash? It was the same entity to accompany brutal leaders like Iraq's Saddam Hussein to the gallows in 2006 and Libya's Moammar Gadhafi, fleeing from an opposition militia to a pipe drain under a road where he was captured and brutally killed, in 2011. It was karma - and, based on Raisi's brutal and murderous history, it saved him for the violent end-of-life experience he too so richly deserved!\n\nContent created by the WND News Center is available for re-publication without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

        "body": "People gather at Valiasr Square in Tehran on May 20 to mourn the death of President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian in a helicopter crash. AFP-Yonhap\n\nIranians on Monday mourned the death of president Ebrahim Raisi whose helicopter crashed into a fog-shrouded mountain, setting off a period of political uncertainty in the Islamic republic.\n\nRaisi, 63, his foreign minister and seven others died when the aircraft went down on Sunday in a remote area of northwestern Iran, where the wreckage was only found on Monday morning.\n\nThe ultraconservative Raisi had been in office since 2021, a turbulent time during which Iran was rocked by mass protests, an economic crisis deepened by U.S. sanctions, and armed exchanges with arch-enemy Israel.\n\nSupreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who wields ultimate power in Iran, declared five days of mourning and said vice president Mohammad Mokhber, 68, would assume interim presidential duties.\n\nState media reported late on Monday that an election to replace Raisi would be held on June 28.\n\n\"The Iranian nation has lost a sincere and valuable servant,\" said 85-year-old Khamenei, whom Raisi had been expected by many observers to one day succeed.\n\nThousands of mourners massed in central Tehran's Valiasr Square to pay their respects to Raisi and to Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian.\n\nFuneral rites were set to start Tuesday in Tabriz, East Azerbaijan province, for them and the other victims -- three crew, two bodyguards, an imam and a provincial governor -- before Raisi's body was to be taken to Tehran.\n\nKhamenei is expected to lead a prayer at a farewell ceremony for Raisi on Tuesday evening ahead of a funeral procession in the capital the following morning.\n\nIran's military chief of staff Mohammad Bagheri ordered \"a high-ranking committee to launch an investigation into the cause of the president's helicopter crash.\"\n\nIranian women clad in black chadors hold posters of late Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi as they take part in a mourning ceremony in Tehran, Iran, May 20. EPA-Yonhap\n\nFlags at half-mast\n\nState TV broke the news early on Monday that \"the servant of the Iranian nation, Ayatollah Ebrahim Raisi, has achieved the highest level of martyrdom,\" showing pictures of him while a voice recited from the Koran.\n\nFlags soon flew at half-mast and a black banner was hoisted at a major Shiite shrine in the city of Qom south of Tehran.\n\nGlobal allies Russia and China and regional powers voiced their condolences, as did NATO, while the U.N. Security Council observed a minute of silence.\n\nCondolences also came from Palestinian group Hamas, Lebanon's Hezbollah and from Syria, all members of the so-called Axis of Resistance against Israel and its allies, amid high tensions over the Gaza war.\n\nThe United States, which has for decades had a fraught relationship with Iran, offered \"official condolences\" for Raisi's death.\n\nUS says it was 'unable' to provide Iran assistance after helicopter crash 2024-05-21 08:28 | World\n\nHowever, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Raisi \"was a man who had a lot of blood on his hands,\" adding he was responsible for \"atrocious\" rights abuses in Iran and had backed the country's proxies abroad.\n\nWashington had placed Raisi, a former head of the judiciary, on its sanctions blacklist for complicity in \"serious human rights violations\" -- charges Tehran has rejected.\n\nAnalysts did not expect major foreign policy changes, pointing out that ultimate power in Iran is held by the supreme leader and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, who work with a regional network of armed groups.\n\n\"It will be (the) status quo,\" Jason Brodsky, an expert at the Middle East Institute, told the BBC of Iran's relations with these groups.\n\n\"The IRGC reports to the supreme leader and liaises with Hezbollah, the Huthis, Hamas and the militias across the region. The modus operandi and the grand strategy of the Islamic republic will remain the same.\"\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd AU.S.tin said he did not \"see any broader regional security impact\" from Raisi's death.\n\nA Kashmiri Shiite Muslim holds a candle as he mourns over the death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian, and several other Iranian officials during a solidarity march in Srinagar, the summer capital of Indian Kashmir, May 20. EPA-Yonhap\n\nIranian authorities first raised the alarm on Sunday afternoon when they lost contact with Raisi's helicopter as it returned from a border meeting with Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev to inaugurate a dam.\n\nOnly two of the convoy's three helicopters landed in Tabriz, setting off a massive search and rescue effort, with multiple foreign governments soon offering help.\n\nWashington said that Tehran had asked it for assistance without providing any details. The State Department said the U.S. had been unable to provide any \"largely for logistical reasons\".\n\nInterior Minister Ahmad Vahidi at first spoke of a \"hard landing\" and urged citizens to ignore hostile foreign media channels and get their information \"only from state television.\"\n\nGuards, army and police personnel joined the search as Red Crescent teams trudged up a steep hillside in the rain while rows of emergency services vehicles waited nearby.\n\nAs the sun rose Monday, rescue crews said they had located the destroyed Bell 212 helicopter, with no survivors.\n\nState TV reported that the aircraft had \"hit a mountain and disintegrated\" on impact, and the Red Crescent soon confirmed that \"the search operations have come to an end.\"\n\nPortraits of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, left, and Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian are placed on a table as a man signs the book of condolences at the Islamic republic's consulate in the central Iraqi holy city of Najaf on May 20. AFP-Yonhap\n\nProtests and economic woes\n\nRaisi had in 2021 succeeded the moderate Hassan Rouhani, at a time when the economy was battered by renewed U.S. sanctions over Iran's contested nuclear programme.\n\nIran saw a wave of protests in 2022 triggered by the death in custody of Iranian-Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini after her arrest for allegedly violating strict dress rules for women.\n\nIn March 2023, regional rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia signed a surprise deal that restored diplomatic relations.\n\nThe Gaza war sent tensions soaring and a series of tit-for-tat escalations led to Tehran launching hundreds of missiles and rockets directly at Israel in April.\n\nIn a speech hours before his death, Raisi emphasised Iran's support for the Palestinians, a centrepiece of its foreign policy since the 1979 Islamic revolution.\n\n\"We believe that Palestine is the first issue of the Muslim world,\" said Raisi.

        "title": "How Iranian president's death shakes up succession plans",
        "body": "Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi's sudden death has thrown into question who will take the place as Tehran's next supreme leader.\n\nRaisi, 63, who was killed in a helicopter crash on Sunday along with Iran's Foreign Minister Amir Abdollahian, was widely considered a leading candidate to take the place of current Islamic Republic Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, an ailing 85-year-old who has yet to endorse a successor.\n\nRaisi's death now raises key questions as to who will step into the roles of not just president but the supreme leader as well, raising potential rivalries and injecting instability into a regime that has grown more unpopular in the past several years.\n\nThe deaths create \"a void in the Islamic Republic's leadership amid a deepening legitimacy crisis for the Islamic Republic,\" Jamal Abdi, president of the National Iranian American Council, said in a statement.\n\nAttempting to tamp down any speculation of political chaos, Khamenei on Sunday wrote on X that \"The nation doesn't need to be worried or anxious, as the administration of the country will not be disrupted at all.\"\n\nAnd Hadi Tahan Nazif, the spokesperson for Iran's Guardian Council -- a 12-member group that oversees Iran's elections and legislation -- told Iranian state television that \"the affairs of the country will not be disrupted.\"\n\nKnown as the \"Butcher of Tehran,\" Raisi was well known internationally for leading the brutal 2022 crackdowns on Iranian protesters who were demonstrating against the country's conservative Islamic theocracy.\n\nIn the violent crackdowns that followed, authorities killed more than 500 people and detained more than 22,000 others, according to human rights groups.\n\nRaisi was also involved in the mass execution of more than 5,000 political prisoners in the 1980s.\n\nHandpicked to be president in 2021, Raisi was seen as being groomed to potentially step in as the country's next supreme leader when Khamenei died or stepped aside.\n\nFollowing Raisi's death, Vice President Mohammad Mokhber has been named as acting president, with a new national election to held within 50 days to elect a permanent replacement.\n\nUnder the Iranian constitution, the vice president, speaker of the parliament, and head of the judiciary -- the country's three branches of government -- must arrange for and hold an election.\n\nBut the process is seen as controlled by Iran's hardline clerical leaders, with popular participation in elections largely on the decline in recent years, according to Abdi.\n\n\"Most recently, this spring, the vast majority of Iranian voters stayed home in parliamentary elections where most moderate and reformist candidates were barred from running,\" he said.\n\n\"The state will now weigh its interest in mobilizing public participation in an unprecedented election at a time of great regional turmoil against its fears of popular challenges to its rule amid domestic unease.\"\n\nTop contenders for the next president -- and eventually the next supreme leader -- include Khamenei's son, Mojtaba Khamenei, as well as Alireza Arafi, a member of the group in charge of selecting a new supreme leader known as the Assembly of Experts.\n\n\"Raisi's death raises the prospect of renewed jockeying for the position,\" Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote of the situation. \"This does not guarantee the rise of the person seen as Raisi's chief rival for the job, Khamenei's son Mojtaba. There is deep resistance to the inheritance of power in Iran.\"\n\nThe vote also comes at a turbulent time for Iran, with a regional conflict with Israel, rising economic struggles and public unrest among Iranian civilians that are unhappy with the regime's social and political restrictions.\n\nAlterman predicted that the most likely outcome in deciding on Raisi's replacement \"is quiet competition within the state's coercive apparatus, with elements of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and military and intelligence figures competing for advantage, and a possible marginalization of clerical leadership in the longer term.\"\n\nSuch a trend has been underway in Iran for more than a decade, as hostility to the rule of clerics grows among Iran's young and increasingly impoverished population, he said.\n\nThe United States, meanwhile, offered \"official condolences\" for the deaths of Raisi and Amirabdollahian.\n\n\"As Iran selects a new president, we reaffirm our support for the Iranian people and their struggle for human rights and fundamental freedoms,\" the State Department's top spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement.\n\nBiden administration officials defended the sentiment despite a decades-long adversarial relationship with Tehran, with a recent flare up after Israel killed several high-ranking Iranian military commanders in Syria. Iran responded by launching more than 300 drones and missiles at Israel, an attack that President Biden had the U.S. military thwart.\n\nFollowing Sunday's helicopter crash, analysts speculated whether Iran might accuse Israel or the U.S. of politically motivated sabotage, even as initial reports indicated the aircraft crashed due to foggy conditions as it flew through the mountains of northwestern Iran.\n\nBut Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Monday staunchly denied that the U.S. had anything to do with the accident.\n\n\"The United States had no part to play in that crash, that's a fact plain and simple,\" he told reporters at the Pentagon.\n\nIran's Army chief has since ordered an investigation into the cause of the helicopter crash.",

As Iran selects a new president, we reaffirm our support for the Iranian people and their struggle for human rights and fundamental freedoms,\" US State Department spokesperson, Matthew Miller said in a statement.\n\nRaisi, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, and seven other people who were onboard the helicopter that crashed on Sunday have died, state media Press TV reported on Monday.\n\nRaisi was returning to Iran following a visit to Azerbaijan when his helicopter came down in bad weather conditions on Sunday afternoon.\n\nEarlier today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi condoled the demise of Raisi and acknowledged Raisi's contribution to strengthening the India-Iran bilateral relationship.\n\n\"Deeply saddened and shocked by the tragic demise of Dr Seyed Ebrahim Raisi, President of the Islamic Republic of Iran. His contribution to strengthening India-Iran bilateral relationship will always be remembered. My heartfelt condolences to his family and the people of Iran. India stands with Iran in this time of sorrow,\" PM Modi tweeted.\n\nNine people were on the helicopter that crashed in northwest Iran on Sunday, as reported by Tasnim News.\n\nRaisi and his accompanying delegation were returning from a ceremony to inaugurate a dam on the Aras River with Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev.\n\nFollowing the announcement of deaths of Raisi and his team, the Iranian cabinet held an emergency session headed by Vice President Mohammad Mokhber, Press TV reported.\n\nRaisi was heading to the city of Tabriz on Sunday afternoon when the incident took place.\n\nAn Al Jazeera reporter said that \"looking at the wreckage of the helicopter, the chances of anyone surviving in such an accident are quite slim. We see that the whole cabin of the helicopter is completely burned.\"\n\nThe publication said that Iranian authorities \"are saying that some of the bodies were burned beyond recognition and that they have not been able to identify who is who at the site.\"\n\nDrone footage of the wreckage taken by the Red Crescent was carried on state media. It showed the crash site on a steep, wooded hillside, with little remaining of the helicopter beyond a blue and white tail, CNN reported.\n\nFor the first time, Iran is going through such a situation. The country has never seen something similar with the president and the foreign minister disappearing in a helicopter crash, reported Al Jazeera.\n\nFollowing the report of the Iranian President's death and that of the foreign affairs minister, the government cabinet convened an urgent meeting, IRNA reported.

The Iranian Government Spokesman Ali Bahadori Jahromi made the announcement on Monday.\n\nBagheri Kani, 56, was serving as Amir-Abdollahian's Deputy for Political Affairs.\n\nMeanwhile, the bodies of Iranian President Raisi, Foreign Minister Amir-Abdollahian and other passengers killed in the helicopter crash have been retrieved and have been taken to Tabriz.\n\nThe head of the Iranian Red Crescent Society (IRCS) Pir-Hossein Koulivand said that the bodies of all the passengers in the ill-fated helicopter have been transferred to ambulances taken to the cemetery of Tabriz, the semi-official Tasnim agency reported.\n\nHe said the rescue teams were deployed to the crash scene after an Iranian drone detected the exact location of wreckage of the helicopter. The search operation for the helicopter had continued throughout the night in the foggy and rainy weather, he added.\n\nThe helicopter crashed close to a copper mine called Sungun. It is located in between Jolfa and Varzaqan in the East Azerbaijan province of Iran and is roughly between 70km to 100km away from the city of Tabriz, one of the largest cities in Iran and also the city that the president of Iran and Foreign Minister were headed toward.\n\nSince Sunday afternoon, 40 separate rescue teams had been dispatched to the forested and mountainous area to locate the chopper, which was located only in the wee hours of Monday.\n\nHarsh weather made the region accessible only by ground teams, as aerial approaches were unfeasible.\n\nThe mountainous terrain and natural obstacles rendered communication with the President's entourage nearly impossible.\n\nThe crash killed President Raisi, Foreign Minister Amir-Abdollahian, Friday prayers leader of Tabriz Ayatollah Mohammad Ali Al-e-Hashem, Governor of East Azarbaijan Malek Rahmati, and members of the President's security team and the crew.(UNI)",
