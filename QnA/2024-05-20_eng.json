        "body": "Flight PS752 families say Iran president's death robs them of chance for justice\n\nMembers of a Canadian group representing families of those killed when Iran's military shot down a commercial jetliner in 2020 say the death of Iran's president means he will never face justice for his alleged role in their loved ones' deaths.\n\nPresident Ebrahim Raisi and Iran's foreign minister were found dead Monday, hours after their helicopter crashed in fog. Iran has offered no cause for the crash nor suggested sabotage brought down the helicopter, which fell in mountainous terrain in the country's northwest.\n\nKouroush Doustshenas, whose fianc\u00e9e was among the 176 people killed when Flight PS752 was shot down on Jan. 8, 2020, said in an interview Monday that Raisi played a role in keeping skies open to civilian aviation as tensions flared in the region just before the plane was hit with missiles, Doustshenas said.\n\nFifty-five Canadian citizens and 30 permanent residents were among the 176 people killed on the Ukrainian International Airlines flight that was shot down by Iran's Revolutionary Guard shortly after takeoff from Tehran's Imam Khomeini Airport.\n\nDoustshenas said Raisi, known to many as the \"butcher of Tehran,\" was also tied to the 1998 mass killings of peaceful protesters, the 2019 Bloody November massacres, and a vicious crackdown on the Woman, Life, Freedom movement that began in September 2022.\n\n\"Within days he is going to be replaced with another hardliner. And same with the Iranian foreign minister, he is going to be very soon replaced with another person who has the same record as he had of four decades of serving the same system,\" Doustshenas said.\n\n\"So I didn't feel any happiness that he is dead, or anger,\" because the deaths will likely have no impact on the Iranian regime, Doustshenas said.\n\nRaisi, 63, had been discussed as a possible successor for Iran's supreme leader, the 85-year-old Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. His death now throws that selection into question, particularly as there is no heir-apparent cleric for the presidency ahead of planned June 28 elections.\n\nIn a statement Monday, the Association of Flight PS752 Victims said, \"We vehemently sought to bring (Raisi) to justice for his crimes in a fair trial so that he could face the consequences of his heinous actions. We feel that we are robbed of such an opportunity, but we are not sorry about his death.\"\n\nAcross Iran, its rural population often more closely embraces the Shiite faith and the government. However, Tehran has long held a far different view of Raisi and his government's policies as mass protests have roiled the capital for years.\n\nThe most recent involved the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini, a woman detained over her allegedly loose headscarf, or hijab. The months-long security crackdown that followed the demonstrations killed more than 500 people and saw more than 22,000 detained. In March, a United Nations investigative panel found that Iran was responsible for the \"physical violence\" that led to Amini's death.",

        "body": "In divided Iran, president's death met by muted mourning and furtive celebration\n\nWhile government loyalists packed into mosques and squares to pray for Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian, both killed in a helicopter crash, most shops remained open and the authorities made little effort to interrupt ordinary life.\n\nA year after Raisi's hardline government cracked down violently to end the biggest anti-establishment demonstrations since the 1979 revolution, opponents even posted furtive video online of people passing out sweets to celebrate his death.\n\nLaila, a 21-year-old student in Tehran, told Reuters by phone that she was not saddened by Raisi's death, \"because he ordered the crackdown on women for hijab.\"\n\n\"But I am sad because even with Raisi's death this regime will not change,\" she said.\n\nRights groups say hundreds of Iranians died in 2022-2023 demonstrations triggered by the death in custody of a young Iranian Kurdish woman arrested by morality police for violating the country's strict dress codes.\n\nThe authorities' handling of an array of political, social and economic crises have deepened the gap between the clerical rulers and society.\n\nSupporters of the clerical establishment spoke admiringly of Raisi, a 63-year-old former hardline jurist elected in a tightly controlled vote in 2021.\n\n\"He was a hard working president. His legacy will endure as long as we are alive,\" said Mohammad Hossein Zarrabi, 28, a member of the volunteer Basij militia in the holy Shi'ite city of Qom.\n\nBut there was little of the emotional rhetoric that accompanied the deaths of publicly revered figures, like Qasem Soleimani, a senior commander of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards killed by a U.S. missile in 2020 in Iraq, whose funeral drew huge crowds of mourners, weeping with sorrow and rage.\n\nFor opponents of Iran's clerical rulers at home and in exile, Raisi has been a hate figure since the 1980s when he was blamed for playing a leading role as a jurist in the execution of dissidents. Iran has never acknowledged that mass executions took place; amnesty International says 5,000 Iranians, possibly more, were executed in the first decade after the revolution.",

        "body": "DUBAI, May 20 (Reuters) - Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, a hardliner seen as a potential successor to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was killed when his helicopter crashed in poor weather in mountains near the Azerbaijan border, officials and state media said on Monday.\n\nThe charred wreckage of the helicopter which crashed on Sunday carrying Raisi, Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian and six other passengers and crew was found early on Monday after an overnight search in blizzard conditions.\n\nSupreme Leader Khamenei, who holds ultimate power with a final say on foreign policy and Iran's nuclear programme, said First Vice President Mohammad Mokhber, would take over as interim president, the official IRNA news agency reported.\n\nWhat Could Raisi's Death Mean for Stability in Iran and Beyond? Expert Q&A\n\n\"I announce five days of public mourning and offer my condolences to the dear people of Iran,\" Khamenei said in a statement. Mokhber, like Raisi, is seen as close to Khamenei.\n\nThe crash comes at a time of growing dissent within Iran over an array of political, social and economic crises. Iran's clerical rulers face international pressure over Tehran's disputed nuclear programme and its deepening military ties with Russia during the war in Ukraine.\n\nSince Iran's ally Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, provoking Israel's assault on Gaza, conflagrations involving Iran-aligned groups have erupted throughout the Middle East.\n\nA long \"shadow war\" between Iran and Israel broke into the open last month with tit-for-tat exchanges of drone and missile fire.\n\nAn Israeli official, who requested anonymity, told Reuters it was not involved in the crash. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said he had no insight into the cause of the crash, adding the United States had no part to play in it.\n\nUnder the Islamic Republic's constitution, a new presidential election must be held within 50 days.\n\nAny candidate must first be vetted by the Guardian Council, a hardline watchdog that has often disqualified even prominent conservative and moderate officials, meaning the overall thrust of Iranian policy would be unlikely to change.\n\n\"As Iran selects a new president, we reaffirm our support for the Iranian people and their struggle for human rights and fundamental freedoms,\" State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said as the U.S. expressed its \"official condolences\".\n\nIn Iran, President's Death Met by Muted Mourning and Furtive Celebration\n\nGovernment loyalists packed into mosques and squares to pray for Raisi, but most shops remained open and the authorities made little effort to interrupt ordinary life.\n\n\"He was a hard working president. His legacy will endure as long as we are alive,\" said Mohammad Hossein Zarrabi, 28, a member of the volunteer Basij religious militia in the holy Shi'ite city of Qom.\n\nBut other Iranians showed little sorrow.\n\n\"Who cares. One hardliner dies, another takes over and our misery continues,\" said Reza, 47, a shopkeeper in the central desert city of Yazd who did not give his full name, fearing reprisals. \"We're too busy with economic and social issues to worry about such news.\"\n\nState media reported that images from the site showed the U.S.-made Bell 212 helicopter slammed into a mountain peak, although there was no official word on the cause of the crash. The dead also included the governor of East Azerbaijan Province and a senior imam from Tabriz city.\n\nIran was a major buyer of Bell helicopters under the U.S.-backed Shah before the 1979 Islamic revolution, though the exact origin of the aircraft that crashed was not clear. Decades of sanctions have made it hard for Iran to obtain parts or upgrade its aircraft.\n\nThe helicopter went down in Varzeqan region north of Tabriz, as Raisi returned from an official visit to the border with Azerbaijan, in Iran's northwest, to inaugurate the Qiz-Qalasi Dam, a joint project.\n\nUS to Keep Confronting Iran on Terrorism, Arms, Nuclear Program\n\nSince taking office, Raisi, 63, had ordered a tightening of morality laws, oversaw a bloody crackdown on anti-government protests and pushed hard in nuclear talks with world powers.\n\nIn Iran's dual political system, split between the clerical establishment and the government, it is Raisi's 85-year-old mentor Khamenei, supreme leader since 1989, who holds decision-making power on all major policies.\n\nRaisi's victory in a closely managed election in 2021 brought all branches of power under the control of hardliners, after eight years when the presidency had been held by pragmatist Hassan Rouhani and a nuclear deal negotiated with powers including Washington.\n\nHowever, Raisi's standing may have been dented by the widespread protests against clerical rule following the death of 22-year-old Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini in morality police custody, and a failure to turn around Iran's economy, hamstrung by Western sanctions.\n\nThough far from being a foregone conclusion in Iran's opaque politics, Raisi, a middle-ranking Shi'ite cleric, had been widely seen as a leading candidate to succeed Khamenei.\n\n\"There's no other candidate right now (with) that kind of a platform and that's why the presidential elections in Iran, however they unfold, will be the first decider about what comes next,\" said Vali Nasr, professor of Middle East Studies and International Affairs at John Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.\n\nDeputy Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri Kani was appointed as acting foreign minister, IRNA said.\n\nUN Must Tackle Iran's 'Human Rights Crisis,' Amnesty International Says\n\nSaudi Arabia's foreign minister called Kani to express condolences and reiterated Saudi's support for Iran.\n\nFuneral ceremonies for Raisi will be held from Tuesday to Thursday in the cities of Tabriz, Qom, Tehran and Birjand until his final burial at the Imam Reza Shrine in Masshad, according to Iranian media.\n\nMessages of condolences flooded in from Iran's other regional neighbours and allies, including the leaders of Syria, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Jordan, Iraq and Pakistan.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin called Raisi \"a true friend of Russia\". The Kremlin said he had spoken to Mokhber by phone and both stressed \"mutual intention to further strengthen Russian-Iranian interaction\".\n\nIran-backed militant group Hamas, fighting Israeli forces in Gaza with Tehran's support, issued a statement expressing sympathy to the Iranian people for \"this immense loss\".",

        "title": "Opinion: Opinion | Raisi Transformed Iran's Foreign Policy. Yet, His Death Won't Change Much",
        "body": "On May 19, the world was stunned by news of the disappearance and later the crash of a helicopter in the Varzhagan region of northwestern Iran, carrying the country's President, Ebrahim Raisi, Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdullahian, and other officials. The next day, Vice-President Mansouri confirmed reports that Raisi and his delegation had died in the crash. First Vice-President Mohammad Mukhbel will now serve as the Acting President of Iran until fresh elections are held. The Deputy Foreign Minister, Ali Bagheri Kani, has taken charge as the Acting Foreign Minister. According to the Iranian Constitution, in the event of the death of the President, Iran must hold a fresh election in 50 days.\n\nRaisi was returning from the Azerbaijan border on Sunday after flagging off a jointly built dam project with his Azeri counterpart, Ilham Aliyev. The project is the third dam built by the two countries on the Arax River. According to the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), Raisi was travelling on a US-made Bell 212 helicopter, which was not in the best condition reportedly because of the US embargo on the supply of spare parts to Iran.\n\nA Chequered Legacy\n\nWhile the provisions of the Iranian Constitution do not leave room for any power vacuum, Raisi, 63, leaves behind a somewhat mixed legacy. Beginning life as a cleric and then moving on to the judiciary, Raisi rose consistently in rank to finally become president in 2021. Unlike his \"reformist\" predecessor Hassan Rouhani, Raisi belonged to the \"hardliners\" camp. He was known to be close to the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and was seen by many as one of his possible successors.\n\nRaisi took charge in Tehran against the backdrop of a crumbling Iranian economy, further devastated by renewed US sanctions as the then US President, Donald Trump, pulled out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that iran had negotiated with the US, the UK, France, Russia, China, Germany, and the European Union. The Covid-19 pandemic further exacerbated his challenges.\n\nRead | Ebrahim Raisi, Iran President: Fall Of Shah, Rise Of Raisi\n\nDifficult as the situation was, his government ordered a tightening of morality laws. Under Raisi's watch, Iranians saw a bloody crackdown on the allegedly \"anti-government\" protests - also called the Enghelab protests - in 2022 against compulsory hijab and dress codes. Hundreds of people were reported to have died in the crackdown, and many more were arrested.\n\nDecades before that, he was also sanctioned by the US administration for his alleged role in the 1988 executions of thousands of political prisoners in the country's jails - charges that he had denied but which earned him the infamous moniker of the \"Butcher of Tehran\". Raisi's conservative policies made him a chequered figure in domestic Iranian politics.\n\nA Tough Bargainer\n\nOn the other hand, in terms of foreign policy, Raisi was a firm negotiator in nuclear talks with world powers. With the JCPOA in jeopardy, Raisi and his Foreign Minister pivoted to the east, drawing Iran closer to countries like Russia, China, the Central Asian countries, and even Africa. Raisi even expended effort in cultivating better relations with India at a time when bilateral relations were under a cloud because of the sanctions on Tehran.\n\nUnder Raisi, Iran concentrated more on regional and Eurasian partnerships. The country became a member of both BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and Raisi had thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for helping facilitate these memberships. During his reign, Iran also entered a \"truce\" facilitated by China with arch-rival Saudi Arabia. This led to the reestablishing of diplomatic relations between the two. Additionally, Iran has also been helping Russia in its war on Ukraine by supplying it with military drones.\n\nRead | Iran President's Death A Spark In Tinderbox. Geopolitical Impact Explained\n\nIn the Arab world, Raisi's reign saw a strengthening of Iran's relations with countries like Kuwait and Egypt, as well as efforts to rebuild strained relations with neighbours like Azerbaijan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Turkey, and Pakistan. In fact, soon after the tit-for-tat strikes on each other's territory, Raisi had visited Islamabad as a conciliatory gesture.\n\nUnder him, Iran's oil production rose to its highest at 3.4 million barrels per day, exceeding even pre-sanctions levels. China accounted for the most sales. Separately, Raisi was pushing for the continuation of the Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline, which had been stalled for more than a decade, and was also seeking to recover debts from the UK after the latter violated the 1979 tank supply contract with Iran worth \u00a3400 m. With the US, Tehran was conducting secret negotiations under Raisi regarding the country's nuclear programme and hostage exchange. Just last year, the US released $6 billion of Iranian frozen funds in exchange.\n\nThe Israel-Gaza Crisis, And Iran\n\nThe most talked about factor in the current times, however, is the devastating war between Israel, Iran's sworn enemy, and Hamas, whom Iran supports. While Iran continued supporting its Shiite proxies across the region - the militias in Iraq, the Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the Houthis in Yemen - its support for Hamas, the only Sunni proxy that Iran supports, has been a striking example of Shia-Sunni cooperation in the region. His legacy will also include the astonishing and unprecedented direct attacks on Israel as a response to the strikes on the Iranian diplomatic compound in Damascus in April.\n\nWith regards to India, Raisi's legacy will note not just renewed bilateral relations but the clinching of the 10-year agreement between the two sides for the management of the Chabahar port. The project had been close to his heart and he had discussed it a number of times in meetings and phone calls with Modi. India, in turn, has declared a one-day mourning throughout the country as a mark of respect for the demise of Raisi and Amirabdollahian. Both Modi and India's External Affairs Minister, S. Jaishankar, expressed condolences on X.\n\nThe Show Goes On\n\nHowever, despite his deep imprint on Iran's foreign policy, Raisi's demise may not see any major foreign policy shifts in the region. The country's Strategic Council on Foreign Relations said in a statement on Monday that Tehran would continue to pursue its \"foreign policy agenda\" under Supreme Leader Seyyed Ali Khamenei. \"Without a doubt, the path of Iran's foreign policy will continue with strength and power, under the guidance of the Supreme Leader,\" the statement read. Another report in IRNA commended the duo \"for their efforts in confronting the unjust [Western] sanctions, securing Iran's membership in international alliances such the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and BRICS, expanding cooperation with the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU), supporting the Axis of Resistance and the Palestinian cause, as well as improving Iran's relations with neighbouring countries.\"\n\nForeign policy in Iran is often shaped by not only the Iranian Foreign Ministry but also by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), though the ultimate decision-making authority lies with the Supreme Leader. Thus, no major foreign policy shift should be expected under a new president. Nonetheless, Iran will be investigating the crash and foul play can't be ruled out - yet. If, in case, at any time in future, it is discovered that the crash was engineered, Iran may be forced to act. That, however, is a long way off.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\n(Aditi Bhaduri is a journalist and political analyst)\n\nDisclaimer: These are the personal opinions of the author",
