Since Wednesday, Israel has faced over 425 rocket attacks from southern Lebanon, resulting in significant forest fires. Tensions have escalated after the killing of Hezbollah leader Talib Sami Abdallah in an Israeli airstrike.

Brazil has opposed Israeli attacks since October 7, and Erdoan praised Lula's criticism of Israel's military actions.

Earlier, 10 rockets were fired from southern Lebanon towards the Metula settlement, triggering sirens but causing no casualties.

Chinese state media also reported an incident where Philippine personnel allegedly pointed guns at China's Coast Guard, further heightening tensions."]],"hoverinfo":"none","marker":{"color":"red","size":6,"symbol":"x"},"mode":"markers","name":"South China Sea Dispute (1)","x":[-15.115779876708984,28.18657684326172,-15.579185485839844,-2.614196300506592,-17.403396606445312,-13.238451957702637,-16.663930892944336,-9.27147388458252,-19.44907569885254,-13.829679489135742,-18.445812225341797,-12.62220287322998,-12.622299194335938,-14.78863525390625,-17.544281005859375,-12.622308731079102,-14.572629928588867,-19.61557960510254,-13.011900901794434,-10.488116264343262,-18.536924362182617,-4.080216884613037,-14.614145278930664,-19.60801124572754,-16.150741577148438,-18.537172317504883,-18.220861434936523,-18.44580078125,-19.445837020874023,-19.615543365478516,-19.347261428833008,-8.072511672973633,-4.015181064605713,-19.956266403198242,-16.51752471923828,-19.956321716308594,-16.71309471130371,-5.2614665031433105,-19.61565589904785,-15.274405479431152,-7.096391201019287,-17.747074127197266,-16.150739669799805,-17.747072219848633,-17.54484748840332,-1.6818561553955078,-19.624298095703125,-9.532336235046387,-16.427358627319336,-10.847593307495117,-10.082863807678223,-0.07944930344820023,-19.703542709350586,-5.1002607345581055,-1.0997562408447266,-7.902404308319092,-6.404885292053223,-7.963360786437988,-18.06436538696289,-10.595139503479004,-4.674596786499023,-14.60607624053955,-6.69564962387085,-10.803162574768066,-10.488121032714844,-5.78986930847168,-8.039875984191895,-5.91349458694458,-13.604955673217773,-6.0894365310668945,-14.164999008178711,-2.905040740966797,-6.949196815490723,-14.119279861450195,-5.621270656585693,-12.276341438293457,-6.349183559417725,-4.845362663269043,-4.998440265655518,-7.770920753479004,-7.158632755279541,-6.4428815841674805,-5.820501804351807,-5.0648603439331055,-16.129878997802734,-7.05221700668335,-15.217597961425781,-7.463222026824951,-4.7986626625061035,-2.808248281478882,-8.919642448425293,-2.5539448261260986,-13.97232723236084,-4.133229732513428,13.868010520935059,-1.708827018737793,-2.7739052772521973,-11.794005393981934],"y":[-13.015589714050293,-13.973761558532715,-8.150132179260254,-4.729339599609375,-15.387946128845215,-13.079300880432129,-18.07129669189453,-22.931249618530273,-12.353109359741211,-12.759550094604492,-12.051207542419434,-10.036245346069336,-10.036624908447266,-12.302542686462402,-10.519709587097168,-10.036628723144531,-21.578550338745117,-11.499702453613281,-15.873381614685059,4.9133076667785645,-11.079536437988281,-13.769479751586914,-14.525933265686035,-14.49479866027832,-8.265887260437012,-11.079351425170898,-13.91718578338623,-12.051201820373535,-12.351855278015137,-11.499712944030762,-12.039596557617188,-20.132299423217773,-1.492734670639038,-12.044013023376465,-14.562742233276367,-12.044010162353516,-14.347970962524414,-0.7192164659500122,-11.499640464782715,-14.094149589538574,-13.074063301086426,-10.277929306030273,-8.265887260437012,-10.277932167053223,-10.519169807434082,-6.588024616241455,10.185013771057129,-11.11030387878418,-18.277326583862305,-23.439937591552734,-19.984718322753906,-2.6588377952575684,-14.621089935302734,-9.415217399597168,-4.578277587890625,-8.064833641052246,-7.472562313079834,-20.16013526916504,-13.586092948913574,-19.952560424804688,-21.737550735473633,-10.299263954162598,-1.7480734586715698,-17.325342178344727,4.913310527801514,-5.5537214279174805,-7.774261474609375,-25.124980926513672,-13.086872100830078,-8.907059669494629,-21.566268920898438,-12.872715950012207,-2.4993016719818115,-18.925933837890625,-4.5899739265441895,-17.684736251831055,-23.63882827758789,-4.213265419006348,-2.2335424423217773,-1.8959753513336182,-1.3313425779342651,-2.2440426349639893,-8.148537635803223,-2.1654796600341797,-15.104968070983887,-2.2786004543304443,-14.843390464782715,-9.161808967590332,-5.731546878814697,-1.599541187286377,-2.6443026065826416,-5.596147060394287,-19.341415405273438,-13.606156349182129,-4.063841819763184,-12.075728416442871,-12.455812454223633,-12.53849983215332],"type":"scatter"},{"customdata":[["The article discusses the upcoming COP29 climate summit in Azerbaijan, emphasizing the need for finance and equity to be central themes.
