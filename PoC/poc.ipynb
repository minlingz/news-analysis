      "\n",
      "此前，李強與馬斯克也曾有過多次見面。早在2018年7月，時任上海市委書記的李強就會見了馬斯克。當年，特斯拉首個海外超級工廠落戶上海臨港，這是上海有史以來最大的外資制造業項目。僅僅半年後，特斯拉上海超級工廠開工，創造了「當年開工、當年竣工、當年投產、當年上市」的中國速度。隨後，從0輛到100萬輛車，特斯拉上海超級工廠用了33個月，從100萬輛到200萬輛，僅耗時13個月。\n",

      "特斯拉曾經的輝煌與中國市場密不可分\n",
      "\n",
      "彼時的馬斯克，可謂「春風得意」。2020年1月7日，特斯拉在上海超級工廠首次交付國產Model 3，當時馬斯克親臨現場，興奮地來了一支即興舞蹈。\n",
      "\n",
      "其實在落戶上海之前，特斯拉陷入嚴重的產能危機和現金流危機，一方面Model 3產量無法滿足交付需求，另一方面巨大的研發投入導致公司資金鏈接近崩潰。馬斯克在《矽谷鋼鐵俠：埃隆·馬斯克的冒險人生》一書中提到，2013年3月，他差點將特斯拉以110億美元的價格出售給谷歌「當時特斯拉正處在破產的邊緣」。\n",
      "\n",
      "近日特斯拉公司再度陷入困境\n",
      "\n",
      "歷史再度重演，最近一段日子馬斯克又開始過得不太舒心，公司面臨最大規模裁員。4月15日，馬斯克宣布特斯拉將在全球裁員10%，截至2023年12月31日，特斯拉全球員工總數為140473人。依此推算，特斯拉本輪裁員涉及的員工數量或達14000人以上。這是特斯拉自2017年以來的第五次大規模裁員，當時該公司裁員2%。此後，該公司在2018年、2019年和2022年分別削減了9%、7%和3%的員工。\n",
      "\n",
      "此外，公司還面臨高層人員變動，特斯拉動力總成及能源業務高級副總裁德魯·巴格利諾和與公共政策和業務發展副總裁羅漢·帕特爾（Rohan Patel）宣布離職。巴格利諾是特斯拉的元老級人物，在特斯拉服務了18年，一直擔任著動力總成及能源業務的高級副總裁，負責電池、電機、驅動單元、電力電子和能源產品等重要業務，這些都是特斯拉業務的核心。帕特爾於2017年加入特斯拉，成為了特斯拉公共政策和業務發展副總裁，曾幫助處理特斯拉與政府和監管機構之間的關系。\n",

      "特斯拉公司利潤股價雙跌\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "困境之下馬斯克再訪中國福地\n",
      "\n",
      "困境之下，馬斯克再次想到了中國這塊福地。在一天半的訪華之行中，馬斯克不僅得以見到中國政府高層，還成功拿到「數據安全通行證」，特斯拉通過國家汽車數據安全4項全部要求，即車外人臉信息等匿名化處理、默認不收集座艙數據、座艙數據車內處理、處理個人信息顯著告知等。特斯拉方面表示，這將有利於全面解除（如機關單位、機場、高速等）對特斯拉等智能汽車的禁行禁停限制。\n",
      "\n",
      "據了解，此次試點的四項要求對汽車數據合規提出了很高的要求，得到了各個企業管理層的高度重視和積極配合。同時，為符合相關要求，試點企業投入了較大的研發資源。特斯拉也成為唯一一家符合合規要求的外資企業，其他五家企業分別是比亞迪、理想、路特斯、合眾新能源（旗下品牌為哪咤汽車）和蔚來。\n",
      "\n",
      "除了拿到「通行證」，馬斯克此行可謂收獲頗豐。有媒體猜測馬斯克意在推動特斯拉旗下完全自動駕駛系統（FSD）在華落地。在動身赴京的前幾天，馬斯克在回覆網友關於特斯拉FSD何時進入中國時稱「可能很快就能實現」，表明馬斯克已有預期能將其FSD在中國落地。\n",
      "\n",
      "長遠來看，實現高階自動駕駛是電動汽車的未來發展趨勢。自動駕駛技術正以革命性的姿態，成為推動電動汽車行業發展新質生產力的關鍵驅動力。當下，無論是在中國，還是在歐美市場，都積極擁抱自動駕駛，推動自動駕駛技術的落地。\n",
      "\n",
      "數據顯示，2023年中國市場（不含進出口）乘用車前裝標配ADAS（高級輔助駕駛系統）交付1238.06萬輛，同比增長23.7%，而NOA為代表的高階智駕市場同比大增189.02%。特斯拉更新的FSD版本一旦成功進入中國市場，對整個高階智駕市場帶來的影響將是巨大的，或將大幅強化消費者認知，推動國內高階智駕滲透，並在中國自動駕駛領域中引發「鯰魚效應」。\n",
      "\n",
      "馬斯克放話進軍20萬元低端市場\n",
      "\n",
      "在中國的這一天半時間，馬斯克「放話」特斯拉要進入20萬元低端市場，「最便宜」的特斯拉Model 2將於2025年上市開售，其項目名稱為Redwood。據悉，新車將於墨西哥、柏林以及上海工廠開工投產，市場定價將保持在2.5萬美元上下（按當前匯率來算，國內售價為18.2萬人民幣左右），後期全面投產後價格有望迎來進一步下探。特斯拉目前僅有五款車型在售，包括兩款轎車、兩款SUV和一款皮卡，而20萬元以下的車型一直是「一片空白」。\n",
      "\n",
      "馬斯克宣傳低價車型上市，這個「大餅」其實畫了好幾年。早在2020年特斯拉「電池日」上，馬斯克就大騷技術，提出通過一體壓鑄、電芯去極耳設計、車身一體化等方式實現降本目的，說「用三年左右時間來實現2.5萬美元的平價車型不是問題」。然而從特斯拉公布的數據來看，Model S和Model X在2023年的累計銷量不足7萬輛，這與Model Y和Model 3在市場自行車道「大殺四方」的表現形成了鮮明對比。\n",
      "\n",

      "特斯拉去年開始限量發售的未來主義皮卡車Cybertruck只吸引一小部分買家，大部分消費者無法接受昂貴的價格和前衛的設計。這款占用了大量研發成本的Cybertruck使用不銹鋼制造，這種材料看起來結實不易生銹，但是卻難以駕馭。而不久前剛上市的小米SU7，售價21.59萬起，比亞迪爆款車型「海豚」，售價9.98萬起，馬斯克的壓力究竟有多大？答案只有他自己知道。\n",

      "華盛頓大學研究中國汽車購買習慣的工程管理助理教授海爾韋斯頓說，特斯拉在高端市場不容樂觀，因為它的車不像寶馬或奔馳等車廠的出品那樣，能提供很多的舒適享受。「在中國有太多好選擇了，特斯拉『不上不下』，從它能提供的服務來看，它的價格過高了。」\n",

      "得益於中國國內政策的扶持和市場的廣闊，特斯拉在上海的工廠曾經幫助它成為全球最有價值的汽車企業，也讓馬斯克一度成了超級富豪。特斯拉進入中國獲得利潤的同時，也在使用中國制造的電池和零部件，幫助供應商開發技術，這些供應商後來將技術出售給了中國的電動汽車制造商。如今，中國的電動汽車技術如何？用法國財政部長勒梅爾的話說「已領先歐洲五到七年」。\n",

      "Summary in English(3.5): In the recent super financial reports of US stocks, tech giants including Microsoft, Alphabet (Google's parent company), Tesla, and Meta (Facebook's parent company) have all released their earnings. Surprisingly, Tesla's stock price surged despite a revenue decline, while Meta's stock price plummeted despite surpassing market expectations. Elon Musk's controversial statements have helped boost Tesla's stock price, despite disappointing financial results. On the other hand, Mark Zuckerberg's announcement of increased investment in AI scared investors, leading to a sharp drop in Meta's stock price. Despite the short-term reactions, experts believe that both Musk and Zuckerberg's long-term investments may pay off in the future. Musk's wealth increased while Zuckerberg's wealth decreased due to the stock price movements.\n",

      "Summary in English(3.5): Tesla, the American electric car giant, is set to announce its last quarter performance this week. The company has been facing internal issues such as announcing large-scale layoffs, lowering product prices, and reportedly firing its traditional marketing team. Analysts predict that Tesla's revenue for the last quarter may decline for the first time in four years, with profit margins potentially hitting a six-year low. The company recently announced a reduction of over 14,000 employees, or 10% of its global workforce, in an effort to streamline operations and cut costs. Additionally, intense competition in the Chinese electric car industry and weak demand in the US and European markets have led to disappointing production and delivery numbers for Tesla in the first quarter of this year. This has resulted in significant price cuts in major markets, potentially further eroding the company's profit margins. CEO Elon Musk is expected to address issues related to the Model 2 in a conference call on Tuesday. The development of the Model 2 has faced uncertainties, and with slow production of the Cybertruck, some analysts are considering selling their Tesla stocks due to increased risks. Tesla's stock price dropped by up to 5.6% on Monday, closing at $142.05 per share, marking the seventh consecutive day of decline and a total decline of about 43% so far this year.\n",

On Monday, it was reported that Tesla would also be dismissing its traditional marketing team. Facing strong competition from Chinese EV manufacturers, analysts predict that Tesla's revenue for the last quarter might decline for the first time in four years, and its gross margin could hit a six-year low.\n",
      "\n",
      "On January 15, Tesla announced it would cut over 14,000 employees, about 10% of its global workforce, to streamline operations and reduce costs. However, reports on January 21 suggested the actual number of layoffs could exceed 20,000, including the departure of senior vice president Andrew Baglino, the second high-ranking executive to leave in eight months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to intensified competition in the Chinese EV market and weakened demand in the US and Europe, Tesla's production and delivery figures for the first quarter were disappointing. Production reached 433,000 new cars, but deliveries were only 387,000, significantly below market expectations and a 20% drop from the previous quarter, marking the worst quarterly performance since 2020. Consequently, Tesla has significantly reduced prices in key markets like China and Germany.\n",
      "\n",
      "This price reduction could further erode Tesla's gross margin, with analysts predicting an average gross margin of 15.2%, down from 19% the previous year, potentially the lowest since Q4 2017. Some analysts also forecast that Tesla's annual delivery volume could decline this year for the first time after years of double-digit growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "CEO Elon Musk is expected to face questions about the Model 2 during Tuesday's conference call. Although Musk promised in January that the Model 2 would be released in 2025, recent reports suggest the project might be shelved in favor of focusing on the Robotaxi. Musk has denied these reports, but they have garnered significant analyst attention.\n",

      "Summary in English(3.5): The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in the United States has issued a notice stating that Tesla is recalling nearly 4000 Cybertruck electric pickups to fix a defect in the accelerator pedal that could increase the risk of accidents. The defect, which causes the pedal to get stuck and lead to unintended acceleration, was found in Cybertrucks produced between November 13th of last year and April 4th of this year. Tesla received complaints from owners on March 31st and completed evaluations by April 12th, deciding to recall the affected vehicles and replace or repair the accelerator pedal for free. The defect was caused by soap residue introduced as a lubricant during the assembly process at Tesla's factory in Austin, Texas. The Cybertruck, which was delayed several times before its release in late November last year, is Tesla's first new vehicle since 2020, with the highest performance model capable of accelerating from 0 to 60 miles per hour in less than 3 seconds. Tesla has issued multiple recalls in the past year, including one in February for small font size on dashboard warning lights affecting 2.2 million vehicles, and one in December for software-related risks in the autopilot system affecting around 2 million vehicles. Tesla's sales in the first quarter of this year have decreased compared to the same period last year, and its stock price has dropped by 40% so far this year.\n",

CEO Musk announced a global layoff plan of 10%, and the Cybertruck, which he strongly promoted, is facing delivery delays. This has caused Tesla's stock price to plummet to a one-year low, with a cumulative drop of 36.7% this year. This is the fifth major layoff at Tesla since 2017. In addition to layoffs, there have been reports of delays in Cybertruck deliveries. Investors and analysts are expressing concerns about Musk's management style and the future of Tesla.\n",
      "Summary in English(4o): Tesla, the American electric vehicle giant, has recently faced a series of misfortunes. On June 15, CEO Elon Musk announced a plan to cut 10% of the global workforce, and now the highly anticipated Cybertruck is also experiencing delivery delays. These negative developments have alarmed investors, causing Tesla's stock to drop to a one-year low on June 16, with a cumulative decline of 36.7% this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tesla's stock has fallen for three consecutive trading days, dropping 2.71% on June 16 to close at $157.11, wiping out nearly $14 billion in market value in a single day. The company's total market value has now fallen to $500.36 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "This marks Tesla's fifth major layoff since 2017, with previous cuts of 2%, 9%, 7%, and 3% in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2022, respectively. However, none of these previous layoffs have triggered such a pessimistic market reaction. For instance, Tesla's stock rose by over 3% after the 9% layoff in 2018. In 2022, the stock initially plummeted by 9% following layoff reports but rebounded after Musk's clarifying comments.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to layoffs, the Cybertruck, which Musk has hailed as Tesla's \"best product ever,\" is also facing delivery delays. A buyer from Birmingham, Alabama, named Max Pyko, reported that his scheduled delivery on April 13 was canceled the day before, with a new tentative date set for April 20, which may still be subject to further delays. The exact number of affected buyers remains unclear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ross Gerber, CEO of investment firm Gerber Kawasaki and a vocal Tesla shareholder, has recently criticized Musk's management style, especially since Musk's acquisition of Twitter. Gerber expressed concerns in a CNBC interview, stating that \"no one is managing the ship (Tesla)\" since Musk's departure. Earlier in April, Gerber had harshly criticized Tesla's performance, to which Musk responded dismissively.\n",

Recently, a prototype Model 3 with an unusual camera setup has sparked curiosity.

      "Tesla plans to blend current model features with next-gen elements to ease production. This could mean existing models like the Model Y might get upgrades such as a 48-volt electrical system, steer-by-wire technology, and Etherloop. The upcoming robotaxi might look similar to current models, as suggested by prototypes seen in Palo Alto.\n",

      "Summary in English(3.5): The Tesla Cybertruck was put to the test against a Porsche 911 in a quarter-mile drag race while towing another 911. Despite Elon Musk's claims, the Porsche consistently beat the Cybertruck in both the quarter-mile and eighth-mile races. The Cybertruck performed well, but the Porsche was faster overall. This test serves as a reminder to not always believe Musk's claims.\n",
      "Summary in English(4o): The Tesla Cybertruck's ability to beat a Porsche 911 in a quarter-mile race while towing another 911 has been a highly discussed claim by Elon Musk. Engineering Explained's Jason Fenske mathematically doubted this claim, and Motor Trend decided to test it in real-world conditions. They recreated the scenario as accurately as possible, using a Cybertruck towing a Porsche 911 on a lightweight trailer and racing against a Porsche 911 Carrera T.\n",
      "\n",
      "The results showed that the Porsche 911 consistently beat the Cybertruck in the quarter-mile races. Out of six races, the Porsche won every time, with the closest race having a 0.2-second difference and the largest a 0.7-second difference. Even in the eighth-mile, which Tesla likely showcased in its launch film, the Porsche won three times, tied twice, and the Cybertruck won only once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite not meeting Musk's claim, the Cybertruck performed impressively, demonstrating significant speed and stability while towing. This test serves as a reminder to critically evaluate Musk's statements, though it also highlights the Cybertruck's remarkable capabilities.\n",
      "Original text: Will the Cybertruck be able to beat a Porsche through the quarter-mile while towing a 911? Will it even be able to beat it through the eighth-mile?\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the launch of the Tesla Cybertruck last year, one of the claims that has received the most attention was Elon Musk's assertion that the EV can beat a Porsche 911 through the quarter-mile, while towing a 911. The claim is finally being put to the test under the most generous circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "While our own Chris Chilton cast doubt on Musk's claim in a great post, its validity was further examined mathematically by Engineering Explained's Jason Fenske, who used his trademark white board to show that the Tesla CEO's numbers were probably inflated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Read: Math Throws A Wrench In Elon Musk's Tesla Cybertruck Vs. Porsche 911 Triumph\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Fenske has been invited to the drag strip by Motor Trend to see if his math checks out in the real world. They brought together a privately owned Cybertruck Cyberbeast, hooked it up to a trailer, put a Porsche on the back of it, and rented a racetrack to put the truck to the ultimate test.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the outlet was very thorough, poring over details from Tesla's video, and going so far as to find the actual trailer that the automaker used in its run (which happens to be the lightest car hauler on the market).\n",
      "\n",
      "Where details weren't available, Motor Trend interpreted them as generously as possible. They brought the slowest, lightest (non-Dakar) 911 on sale to the track (a Carrera T), and even put the lighter driver in the EV, to give the Cybertruck the best chance possible of meeting Musk's claim.\n",
      "\n",
      "So this is it. This video is as perfect a recreation of the conditions of Tesla's launch film as it is possible to see. And? Well, it won't come as a surprise to people who have followed their careers, but Fenske's math is correct, and Musk's claims are overblown.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the quarter-mile, the Porsche 911 Carrera T beats the Tesla Cybertruck (towing a 911) consistently. Although Motor Trend only showed the results of three races in the video, on its website it reveals that it ran six races, and in every one, the sport car beat the electric truck, by as much as 0.7 seconds in the final race, but by only 0.2 seconds in the first (and most closely contested) run.\n",
      "\n",
      "What may come as a surprise to you is that, on average, the Porsche even wins in the eighth-mile -- the distance Tesla was likely showing in its launch film. Although the Cybertruck beat the 911 to the half-distance mark in their first race, that's the only run out of the six that it won cleanly. Overall, the Tesla is faster through the eighth-mile once, the vehicles tie twice, and the Porsche wins three times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Naturally, this isn't an indictment of the Cybertruck, which performs spectacularly in this test and is, by any measure, an extremely quick vehicle. Even Fenske admits that he was impressed by the EV, and that \"it felt fast, it didn't feel like I was towing!\" Better still, he says that it was stable, and never seemed sketchy, despite the fact that what it was doing was very silly, and probably a little dangerous.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, I would go so far as to call this race a testament to the impressive speed of the Tesla Cybertruck, but it is another reminder to not always believe Mr. Musk's claims.\n",

      "Summary in English(3.5): Tesla's video showing the Cybertruck beating a Porsche 911 in a drag race while towing another Porsche 911 was found to be misleading. Further analysis by YouTubers and drag races conducted by MotorTrend revealed that the Porsche was actually faster in most scenarios. The Cybertruck did have a faster initial launch, but the Porsche quickly overtook it. Despite claims by Tesla engineers that the Cybertruck's fastest run was not shown in the video, the Porsche consistently outperformed the Cybertruck in drag races. The results were carefully measured and confirmed using data loggers, showing that the Cybertruck was not as fast as initially claimed.\n",
      "Summary in English(4o): Tesla's promotional video showing the Cybertruck beating a Porsche 911 in a drag race while towing another Porsche 911 was met with skepticism. Subsequent investigations and tests revealed that the results were likely exaggerated. In actual drag races conducted by MotorTrend, the Porsche 911 consistently outperformed the Cybertruck. The Porsche completed the quarter-mile faster in all but one run, and even in the best-case scenario for Tesla, the Cybertruck still lagged behind. Additionally, it was revealed that Tesla's original video only depicted an eighth-mile race, not a quarter-mile. Despite claims from Tesla's engineers, the Cybertruck could not match the Porsche's performance in real-world tests. The Cybertruck did have a quicker start due to the ease of launching an electric vehicle, but the Porsche quickly overtook it. Detailed measurements and data logging confirmed the Porsche's superiority in these races.\n",
      "Original text: When Tesla showed the Cybertruck beating a Porsche 911 down a dragstrip while towing another Porsche 911, everyone who knew anything about cars was a bit, well, skeptical. As more information came out and YouTubers did deep dives on whether or not the results shown by Tesla were actually possible, it turned out that it probably wasn't. Now though, we've got even more proof that Tesla's video (while a brilliant piece of marketing) was indeed a bit (read: completely) fugazi.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first heat, the Porsche ran 12.5 seconds at 115.6 mph, while the Tesla followed in 12.7 seconds at 105.2 mph. Over the next few runs, as the Porsche driver honed his launch, the 911 trimmed 0.3 second off the time. The Cybertruck only posted one quicker run, which amounted to a trivial 0.02-second improvement. If we cherry-pick the quickest Cybertruck run and the slowest 911 run -- the best possible scenario for Tesla -- the Beast still crosses the finish line 0.229 second behind the Porsche. (All results from our drag race have 1-foot rollout removed per drag-racing convention, but in the spirit of running an honest head-to-head race, we have not applied any weather correction.) The chart below shows the quarter-mile times for all six runs, and if that's not proof enough for you, check the photo gallery for the receipts -- the official timeslips from Famoso Dragstrip.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few weeks after Musk made the original quarter-mile claim, [Jason] Fenske posted a video on his Engineering Explained YouTube channel revealing Tesla had only shown an eighth-mile race. Cybertruck lead engineer Wes Morrill responded by confirming that Tesla never actually ran the quarter-mile race, but he still backed up the original assertion. \"The fastest 1/8mi CT hit while towing on the day was 7.808s at 88 mph and the trailer tires were only rated to 80 mph so we opted to call it a day before someone got hurt,\" he posted on X, formerly Twitter. \"Our simulations showed the full 1/4 mi race would be close but with the same net result, so no need to risk it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "[Cybertruck lead engineer Sam] Morrill also claimed Tesla's video didn't show the Cybertruck's quickest run. We're not sure if that's true, but we can say confidently that Tesla didn't show the Porsche 911 Carrera T's quickest possible run. In four out of six MotorTrend drag races, the Porsche 911 Carrera T beat the Cybertruck to the eighth-mile mark. Pitting the best runs against each other, the Porsche 911 Carrera T crosses the eighth mile in 7.9 seconds at 91.4 mph. The Cybertruck does it in 8.1 seconds at 86.7 mph.\n",
      "\n",
      "OK, to be fair to the Cybertruck, it apparently was faster off the line. That makes sense. Launching an EV is very easy, and launching a manual transmission sports car - even on the best surface - is pretty hard. However, the Cybertruck only holds its advantage for seven feet. After that, the 911 Carrera T takes off and doesn't look back.\n",
      "\n",
      "MotorTrend and Fenske even went through the trouble of meticulously weighing both the drivers (and their helmets), all three cars and the trailer in order to make sure the results were as fair as possible. They also fitted the cars with VBox data loggers, and those showed the 911 T was faster than the Cybertruck no matter how you sliced the data. Now, of course, an unaided Cybertruck will kick the absolute shit out of a base 911 T, but that wasn't Elon's claim, so it doesn't really matter, does it?\n",

In the first quarter, the Lightning had the highest number of registrations, followed by the Cybertruck and the R1T, which experienced a decline in registrations.\n",
      "Summary in English(4o): In its fourth month, the Tesla Cybertruck had over a thousand registrations, outselling the Rivian R1T by more than two to one, according to Tom Libby from S&P Global Mobility. This is notable given the Cybertruck's unique design and rapid sales volume. Registration data is used as a proxy for official sales since Tesla and Rivian do not provide detailed sales figures. The Cybertruck had a million reservations before its launch, with a base price increase from $39,900 to $60,990. Tesla also introduced a high-end Foundation Series starting at $99,990. Rivian reduced the R1T's base price to $71,700 to compete. In the first quarter, the Ford Lightning had 8,589 registrations, a 51% increase year-over-year, while the Cybertruck had 1,791 and the R1T had 1,786 registrations, marking a 56% decline for Rivian.\n",

Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and while Tesla did show the full, unedited race from four angles, that wouldn't stop the Porsche 911 driver -- presumably a Tesla employee -- from ensuring the Cybertruck won. If the race was as close as Tesla's video suggested, a soft launch, a slow shift, or a slight lift of the accelerator in the Porsche could be the difference between a Tesla loss and a victory.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've been fact-checking automakers and testing cars for 75 years at MotorTrend, and to believe Tesla's claim we needed to not just see it with our own eyes but also drive it with our own feet and hands. So that's what we've done. We rented a dragstrip, lined up two examples of the slowest new 911 you can buy, secured the same trailer that Tesla used, and borrowed Out of Spec's 845-hp Tesla Cybertruck. Then we raced.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you simply want to know who really wins this drag race, you can see it with your own eyes in the video above or scroll down to the results. For the sake of transparency, though, we're showing all our work in this story. We also brought along Jason Fenske from Engineering Explained and Jordan Schiefer from Out of Spec, so you don't only have to take our word about what happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Race Setup\n",
      "\n",
      "We approached our drag race with a scientific sense of curiosity. Regardless of which vehicle won, we wanted to understand how it nabbed the victory. We also gave the Cybertruck every possible advantage -- within reason -- since we assume Tesla also did the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "That starts by racing against a 2023 Porsche 911 Carrera T with a seven-speed manual transmission. This is the slowest new 911 you can buy today, but it's hardly a dog. In prior MotorTrend tests, we've run the 379-hp stick-shift Carrera T to 60 mph in 3.9 seconds and through the quarter mile in 12.2 seconds at 116.4 mph. Per our usual test procedures, we raced the 911 with a full tank of gas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just like Tesla did, we hitched the Cybertruck to an ultralightweight Futura Club Sport aluminum trailer. Futura claims the Club Sport is the lightest car hauler on the market, and after weighing our trailer at 971 pounds, we believe it. That said, the single-axle Club Sport is designed to haul stripped-down race cars, not modern luxury sports cars. The trailer is only rated for a payload of 2,600 pounds, but the lightest Porsche 911 weighs around 3,200 pounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Futura representatives didn't blink when we told them what we wanted to do. The company had full confidence in its product, as well as the Longway ZT501 light-truck tires (rated for 112 mph) installed on every Club Sport. We had Futura's blessing to run the quarter mile to triple-digit speeds at 700 pounds over capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "We loaded the trailer with a second Porsche 911 Carrera T, this one with the PDK dual-clutch automatic and a curb weight 104 pounds higher than the manual-transmission car. To offset that difference, we went on a mileage run to use up most of the fuel then removed anything that wasn't bolted down -- floormats, the owner's manuals, the tire inflator kit. We briefly debated taking out the front seats, but if you start disassembling the car, where do you draw the line? Should the engine come out, too? We agreed it would be disingenuous to run the race with a car that couldn't be driven on and off the trailer. Plus, we had already pulled enough poundage out of the towed car to give Tesla the advantage. For our race, the 911 on the trailer weighed 35 pounds less than the 911 that lined up against the Cybertruck.\n",
      "\n",
      "We carried our obsession with weight even further. The Cybertruck was driven by Engineering Explained's Fenske, who, coming off a bachelor party in Mexico, weighed the heaviest he ever has at a feathery 156 pounds. The Porsche was driven by your author (testing director Eric Tingwall), who, coming off four years of child rearing, also weighed the heaviest he ever has at 196 pounds. Because no pebble went unweighed, those figures include the helmets we wore.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our Cybertruck Beast, borrowed from Out of Spec, was firing on all cylinders. No, wait. Electrons? Motor windings? Whatever. Just two days before the drag race, this Beast beat Tesla's advertised 2.6-second 0-60 time with a 2.5-second rip. And because electric vehicles can get slower as the battery depletes, we used MotorTrend's long-term Ford F-150 Lightning to charge the Tesla between our morning drive to Famoso Dragstrip and before we started racing. When we launched it down the track for the first match with the 911, the battery showed 94 percent charge.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in, our race pitted 11,268 pounds worth of stainless steel, aluminum, lithium, and bristling muscle propelled by 845 horsepower against 3,488 pounds of aluminum, carbon-spewing flat-six, and dad bod powered by 379 horsepower. The only thing left to do was race.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's What Tesla Didn't Show You\n",
      "\n",
      "We ran six quarter-mile drag races, and each one had the same outcome: The Porsche 911 Carrera T wins and the Tesla Cybertruck Beast loses. In the world of drag racing, it's not a particularly close race, either.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first heat, the Porsche ran 12.5 seconds at 115.6 mph, while the Tesla followed in 12.7 seconds at 105.2 mph. Over the next few runs, as the Porsche driver honed his launch, the 911 trimmed 0.3 second off the time. The Cybertruck only posted one quicker run, which amounted to a trivial 0.02-second improvement. If we cherry-pick the quickest Cybertruck run and the slowest 911 run -- the best possible scenario for Tesla -- the Beast still crosses the finish line 0.229 second behind the Porsche. (All results from our drag race have 1-foot rollout removed per drag-racing convention, but in the spirit of running an honest head-to-head race, we have not applied any weather correction.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The chart below shows the quarter-mile times for all six runs, and if that's not proof enough for you, check the photo gallery for the receipts -- the official timeslips from Famoso Dragstrip.\n",
      "\n",
      "Does the Cybertruck Even Win in the Eighth Mile?\n",
      "\n",
      "A few weeks after Musk made the original quarter-mile claim, Fenske posted a video on his Engineering Explained YouTube channel revealing Tesla had only shown an eighth-mile race. Cybertruck lead engineer Wes Morrill responded by confirming that Tesla never actually ran the quarter-mile race, but he still backed up the original assertion. \"The fastest 1/8mi CT hit while towing on the day was 7.808s at 88 mph and the trailer tires were only rated to 80 mph so we opted to call it a day before someone got hurt,\" he posted on X, formerly Twitter. \"Our simulations showed the full 1/4 mi race would be close but with the same net result, so no need to risk it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Morrill also claimed Tesla's video didn't show the Cybertruck's quickest run. We're not sure if that's true, but we can say confidently that Tesla didn't show the Porsche 911 Carrera T's quickest possible run. In four out of six MotorTrend drag races, the Porsche 911 Carrera T beat the Cybertruck to the eighth-mile mark. Pitting the best runs against each other, the Porsche 911 Carrera T crosses the eighth mile in 7.9 seconds at 91.4 mph. The Cybertruck does it in 8.1 seconds at 86.7 mph.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pitting the Best Run Against the Best Run\n",
      "\n",
      "To get more detail than what the track timing system offers, we armed both cars with Racelogic Vbox Touch data loggers, which allow us to visualize what the race would have looked like if the Cybertruck and the 911 posted their best runs in the same heat.\n",
      "\n",
      "The manual-transmission Carrera T has a 3,500-rpm limiter at standstill, and on a sticky, prepped drag strip, launching quickly requires getting off the line without letting the revs fall. Drop the clutch too fast, and the engine will bog, falling out of its powerband. It takes a slow, carefully modulated clutch release to get the perfect launch, which keeps the engine on boil and extracts a small amount of slip from the tires.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cybertruck launch, in contrast, is as simple as it gets. Put it in Beast mode, step on both pedals, wait a few seconds for the truck to squat on its air springs, then release the brake. With no turbo to reach full boost, no intake manifold to pressurize, no clutch to modulate, and a big, fat torque curve available from the jump, the Beast yanks hard even with 4,228 pounds hitched to its bumper.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cybertruck Beast would absolutely decimate the 911 Carrera T if it wasn't saddled with the trailer. But in this drag race, the Tesla and the Porsche shoot off the line almost in unison. Acceleration peaks at 0.72 g for the Tesla versus 0.79 g in the Porsche once it's making full power and the tires have hooked up. The Beast has the slightest advantage -- a couple hundredths of a second -- through the first 7 feet of the race until the Carrera T pulls even. Once the 911 edges ahead after 16 feet, the Tesla never leads again.\n",
      "\n",
      "After 60 feet, the Cybertruck trails by 0.06 second. Even the slow, human-actuated shift from first to second gear at 44 mph and 91 feet into the race doesn't give the single-speed electric Cybertruck a chance to catch up. It remains 4 feet behind the 911 the entire time the driver is lifting off the gas, pushing in the clutch, yanking the stick, and then clutching out and returning to the gas. That upshift into a higher gear ratio reduces the torque at the 911's wheels, and for the next 1.5 seconds, the two vehicles accelerate in lockstep, the Porsche just slightly ahead. But as speed builds, the Cybertruck's power starts to taper off and aerodynamic drag starts to take its toll. The claimed 0.34 drag coefficient makes the Cybertruck incredibly slippery for a pickup truck, but a much larger frontal area means the air works harder on the Tesla than the Porsche. The 911 starts to open the gap.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the 911 reaches the eighth-mile mark, the Cybertruck is 22 feet behind and moving 4.8 mph slower. That lead nearly quadruples between the eighth-mile mark and the quarter-mile finish line. The Ruby Star Neo pink sports car reaches the finish line after 12.2 seconds at 116.4 mph, 85 feet ahead of the stainless-steel wedge. The Tesla stops the clock 0.555 second later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now You Know the Truth\n",
      "\n",
      "No matter how you slice it, present it, or asterisk the claim, Tesla and Elon Musk's big brag doesn't hold up. There's no scenario where the Tesla Cybertruck Beast pulls a fully functional Porsche 911 Carrera T across the quarter mile before the Porsche 911 Carrera T gets to the finish line.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if Tesla had originally disclosed it only staged an eighth-mile race, the video seen by customers, fans, and curious observers is highly misleading. Like Tesla, we recorded runs with the Cybertruck ahead of the 911 at the eighth mile, but that's not enough for us to say the Tesla-911 train is quicker than the Porsche. Based on the best performances of both vehicles, the 911 is the quicker car, unless your race ends after 7 feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The race was a fantastic idea for a publicity stunt -- and we're not just saying that because MotorTrend did the same thing four years ago using a Tesla Model X P90D and an Alfa Romeo 4C Spider. But it was reckless for a corporation worth billions of dollars to make an unsubstantiated claim to millions of people without ever running the actual quarter-mile race. You have to pick the right foil for the tow vehicle to win. In this case, the Porsche 911 Carrera T is both too heavy and too quick for the Cybertruck to earn the victory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the truth: A Tesla Cybertruck cannot tow a Porsche 911 Carrera T over a quarter mile quicker than the 911 Carrera T alone can run the race. Add it to the long list of broken Tesla promises.\n",

      "Summary in English(3.5): The Tesla Cyberbeast pickup truck has impressive performance stats, including a 0-60 mph time of 2.5 seconds and a quarter-mile time of 11.0 seconds at 113.7 mph. It outperforms the Rivian R1T Quad-Motor in terms of acceleration due to Tesla's launch control system. The Cyberbeast can also outpace many supercars up to 60 mph. However, it falls behind in terms of top speed, which Tesla plans to address with a software update. Launching the Cyberbeast is easy and exhilarating, with the acceleration being described as immense. Overall, the Cyberbeast is the quickest truck ever tested by the source.\n",
      "Summary in English(4o): Tesla's Cybertruck, dubbed the \"Cyberbeast,\" boasts impressive performance stats for a pickup truck, including a 0-60 mph time of 2.6 seconds and a top speed of 130 mph. In testing, it achieved 0-60 mph in 2.5 seconds and completed the quarter mile in 11.0 seconds at 113.7 mph, making it the fastest truck tested. This performance is attributed to its three motors generating over 800 horsepower and Tesla's advanced launch control system. The Cyberbeast outperforms the Rivian R1T Quad-Motor and even some supercars up to 60 mph, though it falls behind in the quarter mile due to a top speed limitation. Tesla plans a software update to unlock the full 130 mph top speed. Launching the Cyberbeast is straightforward, involving a specific drive mode and a sequence of pedal actions, though some features like the \"Ready to Launch\" message need refinement. The experience is thrilling, marked by rapid acceleration and significant noise at high speeds.\n",
      "Original text: Tesla has made many claims for its wedge-shaped Cybertruck Beast, including a 0-60-mph time of 2.6 seconds and a top speed of 130 mph -- outrageous stats for a pickup truck that tipped our scales at 6,884 pounds. But with three motors making more than 800 horsepower and Tesla's excellent launch control system, the Cybertruck blasted to 60 mph in just 2.5 seconds in our testing before crossing the quarter mile in 11.0 seconds at 113.7 mph. It's a different story when it comes to the Cyberbeast's top speed, but we'll get to that later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those numbers make the Tesla Cyberbeast the quickest truck we've ever tested by a longshot. The Rivian R1T Quad-Motor comes in at second place and makes similar power with 835 hp and 908 lb-ft of torque (versus the Tesla's 845 hp and 864 lb-ft), but trails the Cyberbeast with 0-60-mph and quarter-mile times of 3.1 seconds and 11.6 seconds, respectively. We chalk up much of the difference to Tesla's launch control system. The Cyberbeast launches in a controlled and consistent manner with minimal wheelspin, which is a sharp contrast to the R1T that lacks launch control and seemingly spins all four of its tires off the line.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cyberbeast will also have no issues edging out a long list of supercars -- at least to 60 mph. Here, the Tesla beats every C8 Corvette we've tested, along with the (992-series) Porsche 911 GT3, McLaren 765LT, and all but one Lamborghini Hurácan. Of course we have to point out that the Tesla falls behind those cars when the contest is stretched to the quarter mile. Some of that can be blamed on our test car's top speed of 113.7 mph, which it hit almost 200 feet before reaching the quarter mile. A Tesla insider told us that a software update will eventually unlock Tesla's advertised 130 mph top speed, but when that will happen is anyone's guess.\n",
      "\n",
      "As with past Teslas like the Model S Plaid, the Cyberbeast is a breeze to launch. After selecting Beast Drive Mode in the Dynamics setting menu, firmly press the brake pedal with your left foot and fully stomp on the accelerator with your right foot. From there, the entire infotainment screen changes to display the Cybertruck in a futuristic black and white triangular tunnel while the front suspension lowers. The owner's manual instructed us to \"wait for a 'Ready to Launch' message to appear on the screen,\" but that message never came (another item for Tesla to add to its to-do list). Instead, we released the accelerator once the suspension was done adjusting the ride height. The launch isn't quite as explosive as say a Model S Plaid, but after about 10 feet, the Cyberbeast really digs in with immense acceleration. Just as immense are the tire roar, wind noise at triple-digit speeds, and giggles the Cyberbeast will surely illicit from any passenger experiencing a three and half-ton pickup truck blasting to 60 mph in under 3.0 seconds.\n",

      "Original text: Good morning! It's Thursday, May 16, 2024, and this is The Morning Shift, your daily roundup of the top automotive headlines from around the world, in one place. Here are the important stories you need to know.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Tesla Cybertruck is already outselling most of the electric pickup truck market, losing out only to the Ford F-150 Lightning. In March, the Cybertruck notched 1,158 new vehicle registrations. That's more than the Rivian R1T's 548, the Chevy Silverado EVs' 319, and the GMC Hummer EV's 192. Still, everyone lagged behind the Lightning's healthy 2,893 registrations. From Automotive News:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In its fourth month, the Cybertruck had over a thousand registrations and outsold the R1T by more than two to one,\" said Tom Libby, associate director of industry analysis at S&P Global Mobility. \"And frankly, I'm a little bit surprised. The Cybertruck is very, very unique, and it's interesting that it's been able to do that type of volume so quickly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Registration data serves as a proxy to official sales numbers since Tesla doesn't break out its U.S. sales from global deliveries. Also, Rivian doesn't report sales by model, and other EV makers omit some model data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prior to going on sale, the Cybertruck had amassed a million reservations from Tesla fans who put down a $100 refundable deposit, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in October.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the base price of the Cybertruck rose to $60,990 when the revised price was announced at launch from $39,900 when it was first presented in November 2019. Both prices are before shipping.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, Tesla started production with a special Foundation Series that starts at $99,990 before shipping. Tesla said on its website that lower trims will go on sale next year.\n",
      "\n",
      "To more drastically undercut the Cybertruck Foundation Series, Rivian cut the base price of the R1T to $71,700, a $3,100 drop. The Lightning starts at $57,090, and a base Silverado EV will cost buyers $74,900, both including shipping. Outside of the Cybertruck, the Hummer EV is the most expensive with a $98,845 base price.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first quarter, 8,589 Lightnings were registered, which represents a 51 percent increase year-over-year. At the same time, the Cybertruck had 1,791, and the R1T had 1,786 registrations. That works out to a 56 percent year-over-year decline. Not ideal for Rivian, no.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honda has pledged to double its electrification and software investment to about $65 billion through the 2030 business year. CEO Toshihiro Mibe made the announcement the Japanese automaker would be doubling the amount it initially planned to invest in April 2022 at a press conference on May 16. From Reuters:\n",
      "\n",
      "The company, a relative latecomer to electric vehicles, first had to ensure it could reliably procure batteries and achieve cost cuts and performance improvements before focusing on software-defined vehicles, Mibe said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As for strengthening software development, we realised the amount we had settled on two years ago was simply not enough, so we significantly increased that portion,\" Mibe said, after a presentation that focused mostly on hardware improvements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Models of a battery-powered vehicle series Honda will start rolling out from 2026 will have a cruising range of 300 miles (482 km) or more, Mibe said, pledging to equip the cars with an ultra-thin battery pack and a newly-developed compact e-axle.\n",
      "\n",
      "The automaker said it aimed to cut battery procurement costs in North America by more than 20% by 2030 and reduce production expenses by about 35%, partly by boosting parts integration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a little more on Honda's plans for EVs:\n",
      "\n",
      "Mibe said Honda plans to launch seven models in its EV series globally by 2030, but pointed out that the spread of EVs in North America and Europe was slowing, after reaching a plateau.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honda unveiled plans last month to invest $11 billion in new EV and battery production plants alongside existing facilities in Ontario, Canada, as it prepares to expand in the North American market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honda originally launched its all-electric \"0 Series\" back in January at CES (I was there!) as it gears up for a long-term push to catch up with other automakers that were earlier to EVs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Volkswagen and Honda seem to be passing each other like ships in the night because the German automaker is scaling back its electric vehicle plans. VW said last week that it will need more plug-in hybrids to compensate as EV sales slow down. From Bloomberg:\n",
      "\n",
      "This marks just the latest adjustment VW has made to its electrification strategy after the company botched several model releases and fell behind in China, where local brands now dominate. The manufacturer has also shelved efforts to seek outside investors for its battery unit and scrapped plans for a €2 billion ($2.2 billion) EV factory in Germany.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, the automaker is selling so many cars still running on combustion engines that it's on track to overshoot its emissions allowance next year, leading Chief Executive Officer Oliver Blume to ask European regulators for leniency. It's a sharp turnabout from only three years ago, when VW's aggressive lobbying for EVs in the European Union opened up rifts between the company and some of its peers in the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "VW had little choice but to lean into its electrification messaging after having bet heavily on \"clean\" diesel engines. That wager went sideways when the company was caught cheating on emissions tests, which forced a hard pivot to battery-powered vehicles. By 2019, then-CEO Herbert Diess announced to launch as many as 75 all-electric models over the next decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "His EV-or-bust strategy -- Diess argued that automakers needed to change quickly if they wanted to survive -- rankled executives from Turin to Tokyo who wanted more time and flexibility to make the transition from combustion cars. The CEO even lauded what he saw as an early-mover advantage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Electric mobility \"has won the race,\" Diess said when presenting VW's battery strategy in 2021. \"Many in the industry questioned our approach. Today, they are following suit, while we are reaping the fruit.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't worry though, EV lovers. Volkswagen hasn't completely given up on electric cars. Blume has struck partnerships with companies like Xpeng and is preparing a brand-new EV automaker for China. VW has also apparently been discussing developing cheaper EVs with other European automakers like Renault.\n",
      "\n",
      "VW isn't alone in having to recalibrate as a result of the EV slowdown. Countries including Germany and Sweden have ceased or pared back subsidies for electric cars that still tend to be more expensive than combustion counterparts, which has hurt the broader sector. Gaps in public charging networks also continue to turn off potential buyers.\n",
      "\n",
      "No matter how you slice it, folks, right now we are in a really strange time for EVs. I still think it's probably the future, but the path there is not going to be nearly as straightforward as it once seemed.\n",
      "\n",
      "In more Volkswagen fueling news, the German automaker and a group representing vehicle owners in Italy reached an agreement worth over $54 million to end a legal battle over the company's \"Dieselgate\" emissions scandal. From Reuters:\n",
      "\n",
      "In the settlement, over 60,000 car owners affected by the emissions fraud will be paid up to 1,100 euros each, Italian consumer group Altroconsumo said in a statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The scandal rocked the automotive industry in 2015 when it emerged that vehicles had been fitted with illegal software to cheat environmental emissions tests. It has cost the German carmaker more than 32 billion euros ($34.8 billion)in fines, refits and legal costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Volkswagen's Italian arm confirmed the agreement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We continue to work in favour of our customers here in Italy. The agreement brings a years-long litigation to an end and offers a mutual solution for all parties involved,\" it said in a statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The settlement applies to drivers who bought Volkswagen, Audi, Skoda and SEAT cars with diesel EA189 engines between 2009 and 2015.\n",
      "\n",
      "Altroconsumo started legal action against Volkswagen in 2015, in coordination with its sister organisations in Belgium, Spain and Portugal who are part of the Euroconsumers body.\n",
      "\n",
      "Volkswagen was called on by the group to properly repay Dieselgate victims who were involved across Europe, saying that \"all Dieselgate victims are equal and should be treated with equal respect.\"\n",

      "Summary in English(4o): This week, the headline in the field of artificial intelligence is undoubtedly the product showdown between OpenAI and Google.\n",
      "\n",
      "OpenAI has a history of preemptively releasing its products before major announcements from competitors to capture media attention, and this week was no exception. On Monday, May 13, OpenAI announced an upgraded version of GPT-4, named GPT-4o (\"o\" for omni), which aims to serve as a personal assistant on mobile devices. It features improved voice interaction, the ability to interpret and reason with photos taken by device cameras, enhanced language translation capabilities, and faster response times. GPT-4o is a multimodal model that can process audio, visual, and text inputs in real-time and generate outputs in any combination of text, audio, and images. It operates faster and more cost-effectively than its predecessor, GPT-4 Turbo.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Tuesday, May 14, Google responded with significant announcements at its I/O developer conference. Google introduced a series of new AI features and upcoming products, including extensive upgrades to the Gemini model, a future AI assistant named \"Astra,\" AI-powered Google Search, and various generative AI tools for images, music, and video. The Gemini 1.5 Pro model now supports a context window of up to 2 million tokens and offers more natural voice, better audio and image understanding, stronger logical reasoning, and improved code generation capabilities. Google's Astra project can handle multimodal inputs, including video, unlike OpenAI's GPT-4o, which only processes static images.\n",
      "\n",
      "The competition between OpenAI and Google highlights the importance of AI assistant development in the tech industry. Both companies' products have their strengths: GPT-4o excels in direct voice interaction, while Astra can process dynamic video content. This rivalry puts pressure on other tech giants like Apple and Amazon to upgrade their voice assistants, Siri and Alexa, to keep up. Amazon's investment in Anthropic's Claude AI model and Apple's potential negotiations with OpenAI indicate their efforts to stay competitive.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, whether these new AI assistants will become the \"killer app\" of the future remains uncertain. Currently, they are not indispensable in daily life, except for translation functions. Analysts suggest that AI assistants could become essential if they develop more \"agent\" attributes, such as understanding personal preferences and assisting with tasks like online shopping and booking vacations. Google is working on such products but has not provided a release timeline, while OpenAI hints at exciting future announcements. Next week, Microsoft will hold its Build developer conference, potentially adding more to the AI landscape.\n",

      "\n",
      "并且，谷歌还发布了一款高级视觉和对话响应智能体项目Astra，用于处理音频、视频等多模态的输入内容。相较于OpenAI的GPT-4o只能处理静态图像，Astra还可以处理视频。在一段演示视频中，它能够通过摄像头视频，识别\"什么东西能发出声音\"、\"现在身处何地\"等指令。不过它的回应存在滞后或延迟，据悉，谷歌未来版本的人工智能个人助理正在通过\"Astra\"进行开发。\n",
      "\n",
      "人工智能助手的\"高光时刻\"\n",
      "\n",
      "从OpenAI和谷歌的产品发布可以看出，科技公司都非常重视人工智能助手的研发，并且，\"首个人工智能杀手级应用\"的位置已成为硅谷各家的\"必争之地\"。\n",
      "\n",
      "从本周的产品发布情况来看，OpenAI和谷歌的人工智能助手各有优势。GPT-4o可以直接接收并生成语音，省去了将语音转化为文本的过程；而Astra则可以处理视频此类的动态图像，这是一个显著的优势。\n",
      "\n",
      "这两个产品的发布显然让硅谷另两家巨头苹果和亚马逊处于不利地位。他们需要升级语音助手Siri和Alexa，以跟上这些新的竞争对手的能力，否则这些产品将陷入困境。就目前已知信息，亚马逊投资的Anthropic拥有强大的Claude AI模型可供使用；此前也有报道传出，苹果正在与OpenAI谈判，以在短期内获得其技术许可。\n",

      "\n",
      "以下为奥特曼与巴特莱对话全文：\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：让我们从较为轻松的话题开始吧！在过去的四五年里，作为OpenAI的领导者，你的生活经历了哪些最不寻常的变化？换句话说，哪些转变对你来说是最为明显的？\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：许多事情都发生了变化。但其中最令人惊异的是，我再也无法在公众面前保持\"透明\"。如果之前我稍微预想过这一点，我可能会说，这比想象中更为奇特。但当时我确实没有多想。这就像一种非常特殊的\"隔离状态\"，让我有些无所适从。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：你深信人工智能和OpenAI的力量，那么，在经营这样一家公司时，你有没有预想过它可能带来的连锁反应？\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：我并未预料到这些。我并没有想到会牵涉到这么多其他的事情，比如公司会成长为一个真正具有影响力的企业。我更加没有预见到，我甚至在自己的城市里都无法自由地外出用餐，这确实让我感到有些奇怪和不可思议。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：本周早些时候，你们成功发布了多模态大模型GPT-4o，它实现了在文本、语音和视觉之间的无缝交互。你能谈谈为何这一突破如此重要吗？\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：这无疑是计算机使用方式的一次革命性飞跃。长久以来，我们都有通过语音控制计算机的愿景，如Siri等早期产品。但对我而言，它们的使用体验从未真正达到自然流畅的境界。然而，GPT-4o在使用感受上与前代产品截然不同。它的表现非常自然，这源于多方面因素的完美结合：它功能的丰富性、融入其他模型的迅捷性、语调的自然流畅，以及它所能实现的多样化操作，比如你可以轻松地对它说\"嘿，说得更快一点\"或者选择另一种声音。这种流畅性和灵活性 -- -- 无论我们如何称呼它 -- -- 都让我对新模型爱不释手。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：请分享一下你目前更偏好的一些用例场景。\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：尽管我才使用了一周的时间，但有一个用例让我颇为惊喜。当我全神贯注于工作时，我可以简单地将手机置于桌面之上，而无需频繁地切换窗口或打断我的工作流程。这手机仿佛成为了我与信息之间的另一个桥梁。\n",
      "\n",
      "举个例子，当我处理某个任务时，我过去常常需要停下来，去其他标签页搜索资料或点击其他链接。而现在，我可以继续手头的工作，直接提问并立即获得响应，而不必转移视线离开我当前在电脑上处理的内容。这种无缝衔接的体验确实令人称奇。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：听起来，这一切的背后是技术架构的演进，特别是计算能力的飞跃？\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：确实，从技术角度来看，这基于我们过去几年在多个领域的积累。我们一直在深入探索音频模型、视觉模型，并努力将它们融合。同时，我们也在探索用更高效的方法来训练我们的模型。这并不是说我们突然之间就拥有了一个革命性的新功能，而是将众多技术元素巧妙地结合在了一起。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：考虑到延迟问题，你认为是否需要在设备上开发专门的模型来确保流畅的交互？\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：对于视频来说，网络延迟确实是一个需要关注的问题。我一直对AR眼镜或其他设备能够实时地与世界交流、感知事物变化的前景充满期待。但网络延迟确实可能成为这一愿景的绊脚石。不过，在实际应用中，两三百毫秒的延迟已经足够迅速，很多时候甚至能超越人类的反应速度。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：你最近提到GPT-4o可能不是下一个大型版本的命名，比如GPT-5。这似乎意味着你们在模型开发上采用了更为灵活和迭代的方法。我们是否应该这样看待未来的发展方向？\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：未来发布的大模型不会是一个标志性的大版本，如GPT-5，因为目前我们还无法确定。我认为，我从中学习到的一点是，人工智能与传统的发布模式并不总是完美契合。科技公司通常遵循着既定的产品发布模式，但我们现在可能需要采取一种不同的策略。我们当然可以沿用GPT-5这样的命名，并以新的方式发布，或者也可以考虑使用其他名称。但我认为，我们还在摸索如何为这些产品命名和建立品牌。\n",
      "\n",
      "从GPT-1到GPT-4的命名方式对我来说是合乎逻辑的，而GPT-4显然已经取得了显著的进步。我们也在思考，是否会有一个类似\"虚拟大脑\"的基础模型，在某些情况下可能展现出更深入的\"思考能力\"。或者，我们也可能探索不同的模型，但用户可能并不关心这些模型之间的差异。因此，我认为我们还在探索如何将这些产品推向市场。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：这是否意味着，为了模型取得渐进式进步，我们对计算能力的需求可能会低于历史水平？\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：我认为，我们总是渴望利用尽可能多的计算能力。然而，现在我们正在见证惊人的效率提升，这无疑是至关重要的。最近发布的亮点之一是语音模式，但也许更核心的是，我们能够以如此高的效率运行它，以至于我们可以向全球用户提供这一服务，而且它的性能达到了世界上顶尖模型的水准。对于希望免费体验ChatGPT的用户，你会发现，GPT-4o与之前的GPT-4和GPT-4 Turbo相比，在某些使用场景下效率方面有显著提升。而且，我认为在这方面我们还有很大的提升潜力。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：你曾提到ChatGPT本身并没有真正改变世界，它可能只是改变了人们对世界的期望。\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：是的，我完全认同这一观点。如果以任何经济指标来衡量，你很难找到确切的证据证明ChatGPT确实提高了生产力或产生了其他直接的经济效益。可能在客户服务或某些特定领域有一些体现，但如果你观察全球GDP的走势，你能在ChatGPT发布时明显检测到它的影响吗？恐怕不能。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：你认为是否有一个时间点，我们可以确定GDP的增长是由ChatGPT推动的？\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：我不确定我们能否将这一增长直接归因于某个特定的模型。但我认为，如果我们回顾几十年后的历史数据，我们会看到一系列模型如何逐步推动整个领域的发展，ChatGPT只是其中的一部分。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：你认为在接下来的12个月里，哪些应用或领域将展现出最有前途的发展？\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：由于我个人的工作背景，我自然对编程领域有关偏爱，我坚信这是一个至关重要的领域。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：你曾详细讨论了深度专业化模型与通用模型的区别，前者针对特定数据训练并用于特定目的，而后者能够进行真正的推理。\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：我敢打赌，未来是通用模型大放异彩的时代。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：在你看来，什么才是最为重要的？\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：对于那些仅仅局限于一个数据集和与之紧密相关的狭窄领域的模型来说，如果它们能够拥有泛化推理的能力，那么无论面对何种新的数据类型，只需输入相应的数据，模型便能够迅速适应并运行。但这样的能力并不是通过堆砌一堆专业化的模型所能获得的。因此，我认为最重要的是要弄清楚真正的推理能力，这样我们便可以将其应用于各种场景和任务中。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：在设想人工智能在通信和创造力方面的前景时，你认为在未来两年内，人类与人工智能之间的主要交流方式将是什么？\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：自然语言无疑是一种非常有效的交流方式。我对于这样一个想法很感兴趣：我们可以设计一个人类和人工智能都能共同使用的机制，让它们以相同的方式互动。因此，相比于其他形式的机器人，我对人形机器人更感兴趣。因为当前这个世界在很大程度上是为人类设计的，我不希望因为追求某些所谓的\"效率\"而让这个世界重新配置。我倾向于这样的观点，即我们使用人类习惯的语言与人工智能交流，他们之间甚至可能采用同样的方式进行交流。尽管我无法预知未来，但我认为这是一个值得探索的有趣方向。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：你曾提到模型可能会随着时间的推移逐渐商品化，但在这之前，是否应该首先将模型个性化到每个个体？\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：这一点我并不确定，但我认为这是一个值得考虑的方向。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：除了个性化之外，你认为商业用户界面和易用性是否会在最终赢得用户青睐方面发挥重要作用？\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：当然，这些因素一直都是至关重要的。你可以想象，在某些情况下，市场或网络效应也会成为关键因素。我们希望智能主体之间能够进行有效的交流，应用商店里有不同的公司提供各种服务。但我认为，商业规则通常都会适用。每当新技术出现时，人们总是说这些规则不再适用，但这样的观点往往是不准确的。\n",
      "\n",
      "在我看来，尽管开源模型在性能上正逐步接近基准标准，但传统价值创造的方式依然扮演着不可或缺的角色。对于开源模型的崛起，我持乐观态度。正如众多技术流派所展示的那样，开源有其独特的地位，而托管模型亦然，这种多元化的格局非常棒。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：关于具体的实施细节，我并不打算深入探讨。但众所周知，不少权威媒体已广泛报道了投资FAB（半导体制造设施）和人工智能基础设施的消息。台积电、英伟达等公司正在积极增产，以满足市场对人工智能基础设施的激增需求。你最近曾提及，全球对人工智能基础设施的需求远超过目前台积电、英伟达等公司的供应能力，你是基于哪些观察或数据得出这一结论的？\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：首先，我确信我们能够找到途径，大幅降低现有人工智能系统的成本。其次，随着成本的降低，人工智能系统的需求势必将激增。第三，通过构建更大、更先进的系统，我们还将进一步刺激需求的增长。我们共同期待的是一个\"智能\"极其丰富且便宜的世界，人们可以利用智能技术完成各种各样的任务。你甚至无需思考，比如我是否想要它帮我阅读并回复所有电子邮件，或者我是否想要它帮我治疗癌症。当然，你会选择治疗癌症，但理想的情况是它能够同时出色地完成这两项任务。我关注的是确保我们拥有足够的资源，让每个人都能享受到智能技术带来的益处。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：我并不要求你对个人努力做出评价，但如果你愿意分享，我想请教你对于Humane、Limitless等公司推出的不同物理设备助手有何看法？你认为它们有哪些不足之处，或者为何它们的普及程度尚未达到预期的用户需求？\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：我认为这仅仅是一个开始。作为多种计算设备的早期使用者，我有着丰富的体验。我曾拥有一台紧凑的TC1000，那是我大学一年级时的爱物，它虽不如现在的iPad先进，但方向无疑是正确的。后来，我拥有了一部Treo，在大学时代，我算是那种不太追求时尚的孩子，但我的Palm Treo在当时绝对是个炫酷的存在，尽管它与后来的iPhone相去甚远，但我们都见证了科技的飞跃。这些设备都预示着极具潜力的未来，只是需要时间的打磨和技术的迭代。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：你最近曾提及，许多以GPT-4为基础建立业务的公司将不可避免地会被未来的GPT迭代所淘汰。你能进一步详细解释这一观点吗？此外，你认为在GPT的浪潮中，哪些具备人工智能特性的企业能够生存下来？\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：我发现一个适用的框架是，构建业务时，你其实是在做两种选择：要么赌下一个模型表现平平，要么赌下一个模型会取得显著进步并从中受益。如果你投入大量精力去让某个用例高效运作，而这个用例当前已超出GPT-4的能力范围，一旦GPT-5或后续版本出现并超越这一切，那么你可能会对你先前的努力感到不值。但如果你有一个全面且可行的产品，人们会自然寻求使用它，而你并没有过度投入去让这一产品成为唯一，那么当GPT-5或其他更先进的模型出现时，你的产品将随之变得更好。\n",
      "\n",
      "我的观点是，大多数时候，你并非在建立一个纯粹的人工智能业务，而是在构建一个业务，人工智能只是你采用的一种技术。在应用商店的早期阶段，有很多产品填补了某些明显的空缺，但随后苹果解决了这个问题，我们现在已经不再关注应用商店里的手电筒应用，因为它们的功能已被集成到操作系统中。这将是未来人工智能业务可能的发展方向。至于优步这样的企业，它们因智能手机的普及而兴起，但它们建立了一个非常稳固且长期可行的业务模式，我认为这正是我们应该追求的方向。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：我明白你的意思，而且我能想象出很多应用你们技术理念的企业，它们在某种程度上都符合这一框架。那么，你能否给出一个具体的例子或新型概念，它符合我们之前讨论的模式？例如，Uber这样的公司，它不必是一个真实存在的企业，即使是一个假设性的公司、一个玩具概念，或者只是你认为以这种方式实现的某个想法也可以。\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：在这个方面，我倾向于押注那些新兴的初创企业。举个例子，当人们想要构建人工智能医生或人工智能诊断系统时，他们会说，\"我不想在这个领域创业，因为你知道有梅奥诊所（Mayo Clinic）或其他医院会这样做。\"但我实际上更看好那些在这个领域尝试新方法的初创公司。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：对于有志于主动应对此类颠覆性变革的创业者，你有何建议？\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：我要说的是，坚信智能服务会逐年进步、并且成本下降是必需的，但这还不足以确保你的成功。大公司虽然需要时间来达到这一点，你可以借此优势超越它们，但同样意识到这一点的其他创业公司也会这么做。因此，你仍需深入探索业务的长期可持续性。如今，我们面临的是一个前所未有的开放环境，充满了令人兴奋的新机遇，但请不要因此忽视了在创造价值过程中的辛勤工作。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：鉴于人工智能的飞速发展，你能否预测在未来五年内可能涌现或成为主流的新职位类型？这些职位可能是当前鲜为人知或尚未存在的。\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：这是一个新颖且引人深思的问题，我之前并未被问及过。人们总是关注哪些职业将会消失，但新的职业类别同样令人着迷。我尝试思考的是，例如有1亿或5千万人可能会涉足的新领域。这可能涉及全新的艺术形式、娱乐方式，以及更加注重人与人之间的联系。虽然我不知道这些职位的具体名称，也无法确定我们是否能在五年内达到这样的规模，但我坚信，人们将会珍视像面对面这样独特的人类交流体验。我不清楚我们将如何定义这样的岗位，但我可以预见，这将成为我们未来发展中一个全新且极其重要的领域。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：最近OpenAI在融资过程中估值达到了约900亿美元。在你看来，有哪些关键性事件或里程碑，即使OpenAI尚未达到AGI水平，也能推动其估值达到万亿美元？\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：我认为，只要我们能够继续以当前的速度提升技术，明确如何持续利用它构建出色的产品，并确保收入稳步增长，就像目前的情况一样，那么我坚信我们会取得巨大成功。关于具体的数字，我确实无法预测，但我对我们的未来充满信心。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：当前的商业模式（可能指的是ChatGPT等订阅模式）是否是你认为OpenAI能达到万亿美元估值的关键因素？\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：这种订阅模式对我们而言效果非常显著，超出了我的预期。我原本并未预料到它会如此成功，但事实证明，它运作得相当出色。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：在你看来，AGI（无论这个概念如何定义）实现后，商业模式会否发生变化？\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：那将是另一番景象。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：关于OpenAI的现有结构，尽管我们可能已经注意到了一些改进，但我认为我们无需再对此深入讨论。你已经充分阐述了这一点。你提到会在前进过程中进行调整，那么在你看来，一个合适的结构应该是怎样的？\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：我认为我们即将准备好探讨这个问题了。我们一直在进行各种讨论和头脑风暴。我希望在今年，即这个日历年内，我们能够正式讨论这个问题。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：关于人工智能的普遍看法，有一个特别有趣的话题是你的货币化模型观点。我们曾听你提及，首先是取代体力劳动，然后是白领工作，最后是创意工作。显然，这在某些方面被现实所颠覆。还有没有其他与直觉相悖的事情？例如，我原本认为会是这样，但事实却截然相反。\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：这对我来说确实是一个巨大的意外。除了你提到的那一点，还有其他一些事情，比如我没想到人工智能会如此擅长法律工作，并且会这么早就展现出这样的能力。因为我一直认为法律工作是非常精确和复杂的。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：关于人工智能和你对\"AGI\"这个词持保留态度，你能详细解释一下吗？\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：因为我知道AGI不再是一个明确的时间点。显然，当你创办一家公司时，你会有很多天真的想法，特别是在这样一个快速发展的领域。OpenAI成立之初，我也曾天真地认为，我们将从没有AGI的时代开始，然后实现AGI，这将是一个真正的飞跃。我仍然认为有可能出现真正的飞跃，但总的来说，我认为它更像是一个连续的指数曲线，重要的是每年取得的进步速度。你和我可能在某个月或某一年达到AGI的具体时刻上不会达成一致。但我们可以想出其他我们会认同的测试方法，然而，这要比听起来要难。\n",
      "\n",
      "GPT-4肯定没有达到我认为的AGI的阈值，我也不认为我们的下一个大模型会达到这样的水平。但我觉得，我们可能只是缺少某些不太起眼的想法，以及更大一点的规模，就能达到某个让人的程度。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：那么，是否存在一个更现代的图灵测试，可以衡量人工智能是否达到了某个特定的阈值？\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：我认为，当某个系统能够做得比所有OpenAI的研究人员加起来还要好时，哪怕只是超过其中一位OpenAI的研究人员，这都将是一个非常重要的里程碑，感觉它可能会，甚至应该被视为一个突破性的进展。但这样的进展是否即将到来，目前还不太确定，但我不会完全排除这种可能性。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：在你看来，实现AGI所面临的最大挑战是什么？你似乎认为当前的扩展定律在未来几年内仍将持续有效。\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：我坚信，实现AGI的最大障碍在于新的研究突破。自从我从互联网软件领域转向人工智能，我深刻体会到研究并不总是遵循预设的时间表。这通常意味着它可能需要更长时间，但有时候，进展的速度也会远超任何人的预期。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：能否详细解释一下，为什么研究的进展并不像工程那样呈现出线性的趋势？\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：当谈及研究进展的非线性特征时，我想借由历史案例来阐述。尽管我可能会在一些具体数字上有所出入。以中子为例，它在20世纪初被在理论上提及，并在20年代首次被探测到。而原子弹的研究始于30年代，并在40年代成功实现。从对中子一无所知，到能够制造原子弹并颠覆我们对物理学的认知，这一进程展现了惊人的速度。\n",
      "\n",
      "还有其他例子，如不那么纯粹的科学领域。莱特兄弟曾预测飞行将在50年后实现，而他们在1908年就成功进行了首次飞行。类似这样的例子在科学和工程的历史中不胜枚举。当然，也有很多我们预测中的进展从未实现，或者实现的速度远低于我们的预期。但有时候，进展确实能够异常迅速。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：关于可解释性，我们目前在这一领域处于怎样的位置？它对人工智能的长期发展有多关键？\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：可解释性涉及多个层面，包括我是否理解网络在机械层面上的每一层运作方式，或者我是否能够通过查看输出来指出其中存在的逻辑错误。我对OpenAI以及其他机构在可解释性方面的研究充满期待。我认为，作为一个更广泛的领域，可解释性具有巨大的潜力和令人兴奋的前景。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：随着人们对AGI的期待日益高涨，关于OpenAI等组织单方面利用其并做出决策的担忧也在增加。这促使一些政府机构介入，希望由选举产生的领导者来做出这些决策，而非完全依赖OpenAI等公司。\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：我认为，对于当前的人工智能模型实施过度的监管将是一个错误。然而，当这些模型开始给世界带来重大灾难性风险时，某种程度的监管就显得尤为重要。目前，如何设定这些风险的阈值以及如何有效测试它们，确实需要我们仔细权衡。如果因为过度担忧潜在风险而限制了这项技术的巨大优势，让那些希望在自家地下室训练模型的人望而却步，那将是一个巨大的损失。但话说回来，如果我们用国际核武器规则作为参照，我认为对人工智能进行某种形式的监管是合理的。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：关于常规的监管措施，你认为政府机构没有意识到人工智能内在的潜在风险吗？\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：我认为，他们并没有真正深入研究过AGI。这些人中，有些曾经强烈反对人工智能的监管，认为那是无稽之谈（当然，不是所有人都是如此，但我理解他们的立场）。我理解他们的担忧，因为监管对技术行业确实有过负面影响，比如看看欧洲技术行业的现状。但我认为，我们正逐渐接近一个临界点，超过这个点，情况可能会大不相同。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：你认为开源模型本身在某些方面是否存在固有的危险性？\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：目前来说，并没有。但我可以想象，未来可能会有这样的模型出现。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：我记得你曾提到，安全在某种程度上被当作了一种错误的框架，因为它更多地关注我们明确接受什么。\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：确实如此。以航空公司为例，安全并非一个非黑即白的概念。人们选择乘坐飞机，是因为他们认为相对安全，尽管他们知道偶尔会有飞机失事。如何定义一家航空公司是否安全，是一个值得讨论的问题，不同的人会有不同的看法。航空业已经变得极其安全，但安全并不意味着绝对没有人在飞机上丧生。同样，医学领域我们也非常重视副作用，因为有些人会对药物产生不良反应。此外，安全还有其隐性的一面，比如社交媒体可能带来的负面影响。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：在安全方面，有没有一个特定的情境或因素，会让你改变当前全力推动人工智能研究的策略？\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：我们有一个称之为\"准备框架\"的概念，它正是针对这一点的。在特定的类别和层面上，我们的行动策略会有所不同，以应对潜在的风险和挑战。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：考虑到众多快速涌现的应用场景，我认为我们当前面临的一个主要瓶颈是人工智能基础设施的不足。假设有研究人员对现有的神经架构Transformer进行了某种突破性的改进，使得所需的数据量和硬件大幅减少，甚至接近人脑的水平，那么你认为这是否会加速\"技术飞跃\"？\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：这种可能性确实存在。而且，这种改进并不一定需要完全颠覆现有的架构。尽管我不认为这是最直接的路径，但我也不会完全排除它。重要的是，我们要在可能发生的各种情况中考虑到这一点。\n",
      "\n",
      "我认为，即使技术发展在加速，这个过程也会是渐进的。我不认为我们会在一夜之间从相对先进的人工智能一跃成为真正的超级智能。但即便技术突破发生在一年或几年内，这在某种程度上来说仍然是快速的。\n",
      "\n",
      "另一个要考虑的是，即使我们拥有了真正强大的AGI，它在短期内对社会的影响也是有限的。我猜测，大多数情况下，它不会在一年或两年内产生足够大的影响，但在十年内，世界绝对会发生巨大的变化。在这方面，社会的惯性实际上可能是一个积极的因素。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：我想你有注意到，大家对你不太愿意回答的问题持有怀疑态度。比如关于埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）、股权和董事会结构的问题，这些都是你经常被问到的。那么，这些问题中你最不喜欢回答的是哪一个？\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：我并没有讨厌回答其中任何一个问题，但关于这些问题，我确实没有新的内容要分享。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：好吧，我猜我不会特别追问关于股权的问题，因为你已经以足够多的方式回答了它，尽管人们似乎仍然对\"拥有足够的资金是有益的\"这个答案持保留态度。\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：是的，即使我真的赚了一万亿美元并全部捐出，也可能仍然无法满足某些人的期望或传统观念。有些人甚至尝试过以某种方式去这样做。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：你追求AGI的动机是什么？抛开股权不谈，我相信大多数人都会觉得，即使他们追求的是更高的使命，得到相应的报酬也会是一种安慰。那么，你每天来工作的动力是什么？你又从哪里获得最大的满足感？\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：我总是告诉人们，我愿意在生活的其他方面做出许多牺牲和妥协，因为目前我接触到的这项事业是我认为最激动人心、最重要、最美好的。这是一个充满变革的时代，我深知它不会永远持续下去。你知道，总有一天我会选择退休，享受田园生活，我会怀念现在的一切，但也会笑着说：\"哦，那些日子真是既漫长又充满压力，但同样也是无比酷炫的。\"我简直不敢相信这会发生在我身上，这太神奇了。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：是否有一个特定的瞬间，让你感到仿佛置身于一个超现实的场景之中？比如之前我们提到的名声带来的困扰，比如无法自由地在你所在的城市中活动。\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：每天都会有一些事情让我惊叹。之后，随着各种事情的发生，比如那个星期（去年11月份被董事会罢免），我收到了来自世界上一些重要人物，如总统、国家总理等的10到20条短信，但这并不是让我感到奇怪的部分。让我感到真正奇怪的是，当这一切发生时，我像是在正常地回应他们，发送\"谢谢\"之类的信息，感觉一切都非常自然。\n",
      "\n",
      "我们度过了那四天半疯狂而紧张的时光，我几乎没有睡觉，也没有怎么吃东西，但我的精神却出奇地好，头脑清晰，极度专注。这就像你的身体长时间处于某种奇异的肾上腺素充能状态。这一切发生在感恩节前的那个星期，那真是一个疯狂的体验。到了周二晚上（2023年11月21日），所有的事情都解决了。然后那个周三，我开车去了纳帕，在一家小餐馆停下来，那里的食物非常美味。\n",
      "\n",
      "所以，那是一个让人印象深刻的时刻。我深深体会到，人类对于几乎任何事情的适应能力都远超我们的想象。你可以很快地将任何事情当作新的常态，无论是好是坏。在过去的几年里，我多次从这样的经历中学习到这一点。但我认为，这恰恰展现了人类的一些非凡之处，而这对我们来说是一件好事。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：这些心理层面的影响确实频繁出现，令我颇为惊讶。在你看来，随着人类和大模型开始承担更多过去仅由人类完成的任务，哪些特质或能力仍将是人类所独有的呢？\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：我认为多年以后，人类依旧会深深地关心着其他的人类。我刚刚在网上浏览了一些内容，大家都在说\"每个人都会爱上ChatGPT\"之类的话。但敢我打赌，这种情况不会发生。我认为我们长期关心其他人类，以各种不同的方式，这一点将永远存在。我们对他人的关心几乎可以说是一种固有的执着。虽然你可能听说过许多关于我的阴谋论，但你可能并没有听到很多关于人工智能的阴谋论。如果你听到了，我可能不会太在意。我认为，我们不会把观看机器人踢足球当作主要的娱乐爱好。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：作为OpenAI的创始人，你为公司设定了许多商业运作的规则或框架，但你同样打破了不少规则。在这个行业中，你雇佣的员工类型是否与其他消费者互联网公司、B2B软件公司或其他类型的公司有所不同？\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：研究人员与产品工程师在大多数情况下确实存在显著的差异，而高管们也同样具有其独特性。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：OpenAI是否引入了不同类型的高管？或者你在招聘高管时是否特别注重某些特质？\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：我通常并不倾向于从外部聘请高管，但我认为，如果公司总是仅从内部提拔高管，这可能是一个错误，因为这可能会导致公司文化的单一化。我认为公司需要引入一些新的高级人才来注入活力。但在这里，我们主要还是依赖本土人才，考虑到我们所做的事情的独特性，这实际上是一件好事。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：在OpenAI的发展历程中，你是否做出过某个在当时感觉至关重要的决定？你是如何做出这个决定的？\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：这很难只指向一个单独的决定，但我们可以提及的是，我们决定采用所谓的迭代部署策略，即我们不会秘密地开发AGI，然后一次性将其推向世界。这是当时许多公司和人们的普遍观点和计划，但我认为这个决定非常关键，而且在当时看来确实非常重要。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：对于押注语言模型的背后故事，我实际上一直感到好奇。这一决策是如何产生的？\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：当时，我们团队正专注于多个项目，包括机器人开发和视频游戏。然而，在这个多元化的背景下，一个相对较小但充满热情的团队开始投身于语言建模的研究。伊利亚（Ilya Sutskever，OpenAI前首席科学家）对此方向深信不疑，他坚信语言模型的发展潜力。\n",
      "\n",
      "于是，我们着手进行了GPT-1和GPT-2的研发，并深入研究了缩放定律，进而升级到了GPT-3。正是基于这些经验和研究，我们做出了这个大胆的决策，决定将重心放在这一方向上。尽管现在回想起来，这些选择似乎显而易见，但在当时，它们确实是经过深思熟虑的决策。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：当你谈到使用个人人工智能时，你提到了这两者之间的区别。但能否请你进一步详细解释呢？因为我认为这对你关于未来人工智能用例的思考具有深远的影响。\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：当然。当我在未来五年内收到你的短信时，我希望能够清楚地知道，这是你直接发给我的，还是由你的人工智能助手代为转发的。\n",
      "\n",
      "我认为，保持这种明确的界限是有价值的，而不是让一切变得模糊不清，仿佛人工智能只是我们身体或思维的延伸。我希望能够清楚地分辨出，我是在和山姆本人交谈，还是与山姆的人工智能助手交流。我认为，这样的区分是必要的，也是我希望在未来能够实现的体验。\n",
      "\n",
      "巴特莱：在规划AGI及其后续发展时，你提到第一个AGI仅仅是智能连续体上的一个起点，我们之前已经讨论过这一点。你认为从哪里开始，AGI的进步很可能会加速？你有没有停下来过，深入思考或想象过未来的具体样子？或者它是否太过抽象，以至于无法具体描绘？\n",
      "\n",
      "奥特曼：我并不觉得它太过抽象，但我也不会将它想象成《星球大战》中未来城市那样大场景。但我想象过这样的画面：当一个人能够独当一面，完成原本需要数百乃至数千人协调配合才能完成的任务时，或者当我们真的能够揭示所有的科学奥秘时，那会是多么酷的一件事。\n",

      "\n",
      "就在OpenAI发布会24小时后，5月15日凌晨，谷歌在\"I/O开发者大会\"上发布了大模型Gemini加持下的个人数字助理Project Astra，用于对标GPT-4o。谷歌称其为\"通用AI智能体\"，其视觉识别和语音交互效果与GPT-4o不相上下。不少业内人士感叹，曾几何时由苹果发布会主导的\"科技春晚\"，如今已被AI大模型彻底接手。\n",
      "\n",
      "迈向通用语音助手\n",
      "\n",
      "OpenAI创始人、CEO萨姆·奥尔特曼并未参加此次OpenAI发布会，而是在会后于社交平台X上发表了一个单词\"她\"作为回应。在2013年的美国电影《她》中，男主结识了一个可以不断适应环境的AI系统，并与其坠入爱河。这个AI系统所拥有的迷人声线、幽默风趣和善解人意，如今GPT-4o似乎都可以实现了。\n",
      "\n",
      "GPT-4o中的\"o\"源自词缀\"omni-\"，有\"全知全能\"之义。对AI大模型而言，要做到全知全能、无障碍与人交流，首先要快。OpenAI官网显示，GPT-4o在英文文本和代码处理上与此前最新的GPT-4 Turbo的性能不相上下，但在非英文文本、视觉和音频理解方面都更为高效。此前，若使用语音模式对话，GPT-3.5的平均延迟为2.8秒，GPT-4则为5.4秒。人类的平均反应时间一般为100毫秒到400毫秒，而GPT-4o最低可达232毫秒，因此后者可以提供几乎无延迟的顺畅交互体验。\n",
      "\n",
      "OpenAI此次未放出任何具体的技术文件，仅在主页上用一段话介绍了GPT-4o的技术突破。普通的智能语音模型由多个独立模型组成，分别实现音频转文本，文本吞吐和处理，以及文本再转音频等功能。ChatGPT就是负责文本吞吐和处理的核心，也就是智能核心。据OpenAI介绍，GPT-4o一改这种流水线模式，可以同时吞吐文本、画面和音频数据，这意味着所有输入和输出都由这一个核心来处理，再加上其在视频和音频理解方面的升级，其处理速度显著加快。这一模式被称为\"端到端的多模态模型\"。\n",
      "\n",
      "多模态还意味着AI可以识别和表现情感。目前，市面上的语音助手常被用户诟病为冷漠、机械、一成不变，这是AI语音交互的一大阻碍。这是因为，此前的流水线模式会让智能核心丢失很多信息，它很难探测语调、识别多个说话者、排除背景噪声，也无法歌唱或用语气表达情感。端到端模式下，文字和音视频都可以成为训练智能核心的数据，从而让其真正明白语言所承载的情感。\n",
      "\n",
      "OpenAI发布会上，演示者要求GPT-4o调整说话时语气，在说话和唱歌之间快速切换，甚至用堪比莎士比亚戏剧的夸张声调来讲一个睡前故事，GPT-4o都能完成任务。在被人类打断时，其也能耐心等待、快速理解新指令。在听到让自己唱歌的要求时，GPT-4o甚至轻微叹了口气。\n",
      "\n",
      "清华大学智能产业研究院首席研究员聂再清对《中国新闻周刊》称，从现场和官方视频来看，GPT-4o确实做到了即时回应、准确理解并执行指令，以及合时宜的语调情感。如果这确实是现场随机的结果，而非为了演示而设定好的流程，那么GPT-4o的能力的确令人震惊。在他看来，由于缺乏技术文件，一个GPT-4性能水平的处理核心如何完成如此复杂的任务，还未可知，但\"这一定是大数据喂养的结果\"。\n",
      "\n",
      "除了现场演示，发布会还有网友提问环节。按照网友要求，GPT-4o展示了同声传译、情绪识别的能力。在识别一位工作人员的面部情绪时，GPT-4o说\"我好像在看一个木质表面的东西\"，疑似\"翻车\"，但该工作人员立刻调整提问策略，声明自己\"不是一张桌子\"。之后，GPT-4o给出了合乎情理的答案。\n",
      "\n",
      "GPT-4o并不是第一个多模态模型。去年12月，谷歌Gemini Ultra模型发布，用于完成任务语言理解、数学推理等高度复杂的任务，被业内认为可叫板当时的GPT-4，也是市面上最先发布的多模态模型。在谷歌官方公布的视频中，测试员和Gemini做了一些小游戏，Gemini能够用图片设计智力问答，或者找出纸团被扣在哪个纸杯底下。整个过程中，Gemini的反应速度都非常快，还会生成音频和图片来辅助回答。但发布会后仅数日，谷歌发言人便公开承认，该演示视频不是实时录制， Gemini实际上只能对静态图像做出反应。\n",
      "\n",
      "因此，GPT-4o的发布被业内人士看作是OpenAI对谷歌的\"贴脸开大\"。谷歌则紧随其后，在15日的发布会上予以还击。相比于OpenAI不足半小时的\"轻声细语\"，谷歌用长达近两小时、包含数十款AI产品的大轰炸叫板OpenAI，包括文生视频领域对标Sora 的Veo，以及对标ChatGPT但文本吞吐量远超前者的Gemini 1.5 Pro。\n",
      "\n",
      "5月15日，谷歌首席执行官孙达尔·皮柴在谷歌I/O开发者大会上发表主题演讲。图/视觉中国\n",
      "\n",
      "谷歌发布的视频中，Project Astra能识别各种物体，说出代码的功用，并与人类实时沟通，延迟上与GPT-4o没有明显差异。Project Astra还能与谷歌AR原型眼镜\"梦幻联动\"，为佩戴者描述周围场景，并根据佩戴者的反馈补充细节。这一应用有可能力压OpenAI，在未来成为视觉障碍患者的福音。有业内人士分析，除了搜索引擎，谷歌在AI大模型领域还在拉平与OpenAI差距的过程中。\n",
      "\n",
      "在聂再清看来，两家公司接连发布多模态语音助手，在易用性方面迈出了一大步，让人窥见了未来通用语音助手的样貌。通用语音助手就是人类在数字世界里的代理或管家，可以帮人解决一切数字事务，包括安排日程、整理和调用文件、利用知识指导学习、利用记忆推荐可能喜欢的产品等。未来随着模型吸纳的信息越来越多，语音助手会更加人性化、更加智能，做到真正的自然交互。随着视频能力的加入，除语音外，表情、肢体动作等也能够被模型解读，作为其决策的依据。有网友评论称，无论是GPT-4o还是Project Astra，其身手足以秒杀苹果的语音助手Siri。\n",
      "\n",
      "距离用户越来越近\n",
      "\n",
      "OpenAI在发布会上表示， GPT-4o将在未来几周内分阶段集成至OpenAI的各项服务之中，包括还未面世的ChatGPT搜索引擎。许多业内人士对此次发布会上GPT-5的缺席表示惋惜，由于OpenAI在2022年底推出ChatGPT的时候，实际上已做出了GPT-4，因此有业内人士预测，带搜索引擎的GPT-5也许已\"在路上\"。英伟达高级科学家Jim Fan在X上表示，GPT-4o已经接近GPT-5，或许是后者的一次早期试水。据聂再清观察，目前还没有看到模型迭代的瓶颈，大模型的迭代速度有可能还会加快。\n",
      "\n",
      "奥尔特曼在X上表示，OpenAI致力于将GPT-4o免费提供给所有用户使用。以往，OpenAI发布新版ChatGPT模型时，通常会将其置于付费墙之后。如今，免费用户已经可以访问GPT-4o加持下的多项功能，例如分析数据、创建图表、撰写文件总结等，但不能使用图片生成功能。付费用户则可以享受5倍调用额度。谷歌在发布会中没有公布Project Astra的具体上线时间，预计很快会登录到安卓、iOS等平台使用。\n",
      "\n",
      "对开发者来说，GPT-4o的定价也更友好。OpenAI官网显示，从GPT-4开始，输入单位文本的价格一直在下降，相较GPT-4 Turbo，GPT-4o收费降低50%，调用速度却提升了两倍。这使其在商业应用上有了更大吸引力。聂再清表示，大模型控制价格的方式之一是提升模型性能，用更少的资源做更多的事；另一个方式则是通过类似搜索引擎的商业模式，对用户免费，但可以收取广告商的赞助。\n",
      "\n",
      "至于未来OpenAI和谷歌的大模型有没有开源的可能性，聂再清表示，参考iOS和安卓，一个闭源一个开源，未来的大模型市场也极有可能出现开源和闭源的巨头。用户体验最好的行业领先者倾向于闭源，而开源的好处在于可以集体将模型\"做大做强\"，二者在市场都有自己的位置。谷歌在发布会中推出了其首个视觉语言开源模型PaliGemma，针对图像标注、视觉问答、图像标签化等方面进行了优化。此外，谷歌还将在6月推出更大规模的开源模型Gemma 2 27B。\n",
      "\n",
      "OpenAI也同步发布了适用于macOS的ChatGPT桌面应用程序，使用户调用的体验更丝滑。\n",
      "\n",
      "GPT-4o加持下的通用语音助手在未来将有广泛应用，例如健康管理、医疗咨询、教育教辅等领域。聂再清认为，所有开放领域用到的语音智能，例如购物App中的导购等，都可以加装类似GPT-4o的智能核心，增强用户体验。这类语音助手将离用户越来越近。\n",

That mobile processor was based on Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3, which was unproven in laptops at the time. Using the Surface Pro 9 5G was so frustrating we felt genuinely offended that Microsoft was selling it as a \"Pro\" device.

      "\n",
      "Aside from updated hardware, one of the biggest upgrades on these new Surfaces should be vastly improved on-device AI and machine learning performance thanks to the Snapdragon X Elite chip, which can deliver up to 45 TOPS (trillions of operations per second) from its neural processing unit (NPU). This is key because Microsoft has previously said PCs will need at least 40 TOPs in order to run Windows AI features locally.

      "Summary in English(4o): OpenAI has introduced GPT-4 omni (GPT-4o), a significant update to ChatGPT that includes human-like voice capabilities, translation skills, computer vision, emotional range, and even a singing voice. Demonstrated by OpenAI CTO Mira Murati, GPT-4o aims to make interactions more natural and accessible, even for free users. The model supports multiple languages, provides instant responses, and can interpret visual data, such as solving math problems and analyzing emotional states from selfies. Its voice capabilities have drawn comparisons to the AI from the movie 'Her', showcasing an impressive emotive range. The update also integrates voice, text, and visual prompts natively, enhancing its efficiency and usability. GPT-4o's release is expected to challenge other AI assistants like Apple's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana, and it will be available as a desktop app. This advancement marks a significant step in making powerful AI accessible to the general public, with potential applications in various fields, including aiding communication for autistic individuals.\n",
      "Original text: OpenAI has demonstrated GPT-4 omni (GPT-4o), an \"astonishing\" update that gives ChatGPT a human-sounding voice, translation skills, computer vision, an emotional range - and a singing voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Introduced in a live demonstration led by OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati, the user interface changes built into the GPT-4o large language model (LLM) - which she said \"will bring GPT-4 level intelligence to everyone, including our free users\" as it is rolled out in coming weeks - have been designed to make interaction with the model \"much more natural and far, far, easier.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For the past couple of years, we've been very focused on improving the intelligence of [GPT] models but this is the first time that we are really making a huge step forward when it comes to ease of use,\" Murati said. \"This is incredibly important because we're looking at the future of interaction between ourselves and the machines.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Through a series of demonstrations, Murati - along with head of frontiers research Mark Chen and post-training team lead Barret Zoph - showed how the GPT-4o app, which is also set to debut in a desktop app, provides a natural language interface that supports dozens of languages and queries while providing near instantaneous responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new model's faster speed meant the demonstrators could interrupt the GPT-4o voice in mid-sentence, giving it new instructions just like one person might interrupt another during the natural flow of conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Asked to read a bedtime story, GPT-4o changed its tone of voice when requested, speaking in a more intense way each time it was asked to add more \"drama\" - then switching to a dramatic robotic voice, and singing the end of the story as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The multi-modal model also integrates computer vision - allowing it to, for example, interpret a written linear mathematics equation and talk Zoph through the process of solving it.\n",
      "\n",
      "GPT-4o's computer vision capabilities also enabled it to analyse a selfie of Zoph and infer his emotional state - \"pretty happy and cheerful,\" the model surmised, \"with a big smile and maybe a touch of excitement\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Once more, with feeling\n",
      "\n",
      "The voice capabilities of GPT-4o immediately drew comparisons online to 'Samantha', the Scarlett Johansson-voiced AI companion from the 2013 movie 'Her' - which mainstreamed the idea of an emotional, human-sounding AI capable of convincing willing users that it was human.\n",
      "\n",
      "The emotive range of the new AI is \"quite astonishing,\" Alex Jenkins, director of Curtin University's WA Data Science Innovation Hub, told Information Age.\n",
      "\n",
      "He likened the original ChatGPT to \"a deaf person who read every book in the world, every journal article, and every piece of paper they could get their hands on - but they didn't know how the world sounds.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They didn't know what human speech was like,\" he said, \"and that obviously has an impact in terms of communicating in a human-like way, because we use expression in our voice all the time as a key component of communication.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Although computers have been \"talking\" for many years, Jenkins added, \"dumb\" previous text-to-speech engines \"didn't understand the intent and context of the conversation. They were reading the words out and not applying inflection in any kind of meaningful way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This new model understands how the world sounds and how people sound, and it's able to express its voice in a similar fashion to what humans can do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The announcement quickly drew a counter salvo from Google, which announced the availability of its Gemini 1.5 Pro LLM - which adds features such as analysis of audio files and uploaded documents up to 1,500 pages long.\n",
      "\n",
      "Availability of GPT-4o as a desktop app will also threaten Apple's Siri - reportedly due for an AI overhaul at next month's Worldwide Developers Conference - and Microsoft's Cortana voice assistants, with Zoph demonstrating how he can feed the source code of the application to the desktop app and ask it questions about the information - such as what the code does or what its output means.\n",
      "\n",
      "Progressing the technology to this point \"is quite complex,\" Murati said, \"because when we interact with each other there is a lot of stuff that we take for granted.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Where previous GPT models used three separate elements to produce speech - transcription intelligence, text-to-speech, and orchestration - she explained that GPT-4o integrates these capabilities natively across voice, text, and visual prompts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The efficiency of GPT-4o is also significant because it will be the first time that OpenAI's GPT-4 LLM - a far more powerful engine than the widely used GPT 3.5 that has previously only been offered to paying customers - is available to any user, for free.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the benchmark against which other LLMs are measured in terms of capability, speed and security, GPT-4's general availability will significantly boost the AI capabilities available to the mass market - with GPT-4o's voice-driven user interface enabling a broad range of new use cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "As well as helping in applications such as helping autistic people learn how to communicate verbally, the new model will likely be able to write poetry \"that sounds like it flows, and sounds lyrical,\" Jenkins said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're a long way from the sort of doomsday Skynet scenario,\" he laughed.\n",
      "\n",

These tools include features like FiftyOne Brain, which provides recommendations and insights, and VoxelGPT, an AI chatbot for natural language queries. Voxel51's tools are seen as foundational for the future of AI model development, especially in advancing towards artificial general intelligence. Recent announcements from OpenAI and Google show the industry's focus on visual AI capabilities.\n",
      "Summary in English(4o): Voxel51 Inc., a company specializing in enhancing visual AI models, has secured $30 million in Series B funding led by Bessemer Venture Partners, with contributions from Tru Arrow Partners and existing investors. The funds will be used to expand Voxel51's community, invest in AI research, and increase market reach. CEO Brian Moore highlighted the importance of data quality over model architecture for successful AI projects. Voxel51's key products, FiftyOne and FiftyOne Teams, help optimize visual datasets and identify errors. These tools include FiftyOne Brain for machine-learning insights and VoxelGPT, an AI chatbot for dataset queries. The products also support vector search integrations with major databases. Moore emphasized the significance of these tools for advancing towards artificial general intelligence (AGI), noting recent developments in visual AI by OpenAI and Google.\n",

      "\n",
      "Voxel51 Inc., a platform that helps visual artificial intelligence model developers curate and refine their data to increase the accuracy of their AI models, today announced that the company raised $30 million in new funding to expand its products.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Series B investment was led by Bessemer Venture Partners, with participation from new investor Tru Arrow Partners and existing investors Drive Capital, Top Harvest Capital, Shasta Ventures and ID Ventures. The company said that it would use the new funding to expand its community, invest in AI research and boost its market reach to help AI businesses in the demanding market of visual-oriented AI.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brian Moore, chief executive and co-founder of Voxel51, told SiliconANGLE in an interview that there's a paradox with visual data that most bits going through routers on the internet right now are visual but insights from that data go largely untapped. Although most AI companies gravitate towards the best and the brightest foundation models, when it comes to visual data, that's not how it works when it comes to accuracy and error rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In practice, the difference between success or failure from these projects came from data quality, and not necessarily model architectures,\" said Moore. \"You could always take the latest and greatest off the shelf, but the reason that 80% of data projects are not reaching production is usually a data quality issue.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Voxel51's flagship products include the open-source tool FiftyOne and the enterprise-scale service FiftyOne Teams, which provide the building blocks for optimizing a visual dataset pipeline and analyzing its labeling, scenarios of interest, identifying failure modes and determining annotation mistakes. With the toolset, data engineers have a fully-fledged toolset for sifting through visual data to refine and evaluate model behavior that can assist them in refining AI models to make sure that there aren't any hidden issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both products also provide access to what the company calls FiftyOne Brain, a library of machine-learning capabilities that can provide recommendations and insights into a visual dataset for users to guide them on how they can get better performance for their models. The Brain can be used to diagnose failure cases in visual AI models when an AI can't understand the difference between visual embeddings when there are annotation mistakes or other issues within the dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using VoxelGPT, an AI chatbot added in June, users can ask natural language questions about their visual datasets. The chatbot can provide images and code samples, give answers regarding documentation, tutorials and application programming interface queries in English. This makes it easier for developers to dive into their datasets or get moving with their workflows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both FiftyOne and FiftyOne Teams also have native vector search integrations with popular databases including Pinecone, MongoDB, Redis, Qdrant and more, making it possible for fast and easy searches through billions of images.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moore explained that these tools are foundational for the future of AI model development, especially the advancement towards AGI, or artificial general intelligence, the holy grail of AI that will produce models that can perform tasks with human-like cognition. Large language models can appear to seemingly reason and converse like humans in text and voice, but AI will also have to interact visually and understand the physical world for that to happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "This has been played out recently with big visual AI announcements from OpenAI with its GPT-4o model, which has visual capabilities, and Google LLC's Project Astra, capable of chatting and reasoning about video. Both of these product announcements, within days of each other, Moore said, show that the industry is hot on the trail.\n",

Both services have unique perks, such as Copilot Pro's integration with Microsoft Office and ChatGPT Plus's ability to create custom GPTs. Copilot Pro also excels in image generation and providing visual information, while ChatGPT Plus focuses more on text responses. Additionally, the text mentions that both services are accessible through dedicated websites and mobile apps, with Copilot Pro integrating directly into Windows. Overall, the decision between the two services depends on individual preferences and needs.\n",
      "Summary in English(4o): Both Copilot Pro and ChatGPT Plus offer access to GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo, real-time information, image generation with DALL-E 3, and document analysis. However, they each have unique advantages. \n",
      "\n",
      "Copilot Pro, initially requiring a Microsoft 365 subscription, now only needs a Microsoft account for use in both desktop and web versions of Microsoft 365. It excels in integrating with Microsoft Office apps, providing powerful and user-friendly features for writing, editing, data analysis, and more. It also integrates directly into Windows, offering a more visual and interactive experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "ChatGPT Plus, on the other hand, offers broader file analysis capabilities, including text, PDFs, images, audio, code, and archived files. It allows users to create and share custom GPTs, and provides access to a GPT store. ChatGPT Plus can generate up to 200 images per day, double that of Copilot Pro, but Copilot Pro's image creation is more advanced, offering multiple options and editing tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "While both services are accessible via websites and mobile apps, Copilot Pro's deeper integration with Microsoft Office and Windows, along with its more comprehensive and visually engaging responses, make it a strong contender for users heavily invested in the Microsoft ecosystem. ChatGPT Plus, with its broader file support and custom GPT creation, offers more flexibility for diverse use cases.\n",
      "Original text: With either subscription, you're able to tap into GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo, get real-time information, generate images with DALL-E 3, and analyze specific types of documents and files. But from there, Copilot Pro and ChatGPT Plus each offer unique advantages. Here's how to decide which one is the better option for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also: I ranked the AI features announced at Google I/O from most useful to gimmicky\n",
      "\n",
      "Initially, Copilot Pro required a subscription to Microsoft 365 if you wanted to use its AI skills in Word, Excel, OneNote, and other apps in the suite. Now, however, you can use Copilot Pro in both the desktop and web versions of Microsoft 365 with nothing more than a Microsoft account required.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for ChatGPT, OpenAI has added a few perks from the Plus version to the free flavor. The free edition now offers limited access to several features, including the latest GPT‑4o model, advanced data analysis, file uploads, web browsing, and custom GPTs from the GPT store.\n",
      "\n",
      "Copilot Pro limits its AI-powered analysis to images and Microsoft Office files. With ChatGPT Plus, you're able to upload and analyze a wider range of files, including Microsoft Office files, text files, PDFs, images, audio files, code files, and archived files.\n",
      "\n",
      "OpenAI provides a GPT store where you can browse and search for custom GPTs created by businesses and fellow subscribers. You can even invoke a specific GPT within an existing conversation, though that feature is now available for free users as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also: I'm taking AI image courses for free on Udemy with this little trick - and you can too\n",
      "\n",
      "Though not all the GPTs are worth your time, you'll find many with interesting and useful skills. At this point, Microsoft has promised -- but doesn't yet offer -- a custom Copilot GPT store.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another perk with ChatGPT Plus is the ability to create your own custom GPTs. The process is relatively smooth and straightforward thanks to ChatGPT's own AI-based assistance. After creating your GPT, you can use it privately, share it with other people in a business or organization, or publish it in the GPT store for both free and Plus users to try.\n",
      "\n",
      "Copilot Pro will generate up to 100 images per day. That certainly sounds like a lot of images. But if you need more, ChatGPT Plus lets you double your fun by creating up to 200 images each day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also: 6 ways OpenAI just supercharged ChatGPT for free users\n",
      "\n",
      "With a subscription to Copilot Pro and nothing more than a Microsoft account, you can ask the AI to help you write and edit text and summarize documents in Word, generate formulas and analyze data in Excel, create presentations in PowerPoint, compose text in OneNote, and draft replies in Outlook. This capability extends to the paid desktop version and the free web version of Microsoft 365. Though ChatGPT Plus can analyze Office files, the integration between MS Office and Copilot Pro is more powerful, effective, and user-friendly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both ChatGPT Plus and Copilot Pro are accessible as dedicated websites and mobile apps. But Copilot goes one step better by integrating directly into Windows. Whether you use the free or paid-for version of Copilot, just click the Taskbar icon in Windows 10 or 11, and Copilot pops up as a sidebar ready to take your requests.\n",
      "\n",
      "Depending on your request, ChatGPT Plus will provide text but not much more. Copilot Pro, however, is more likely to flesh out the information with a more visual look and layout.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also: The best AI chatbots: ChatGPT and other noteworthy alternatives\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, I asked both chatbots to name 20 top attractions in London. ChatGPT Plus responded with a numbered list and brief descriptions of each attraction, but no links. Copilot Pro produced a more engaging and useful response with links, photos, maps, and sources for each attraction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though ChatGPT Pro will let you generate more images in a typical day, Copilot Pro's image creation skills are far superior. By default, Copilot Pro's Designer tool will generate four different images from which to choose, while ChatGPT Pro will generate only one image at a time. Copilot also suggests follow-up questions to help you fine-tune the image. With Copilot, you can select a specific style to apply if you wish to regenerate an image. Plus, you can now directly edit your images within Designer without leaving the tool.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a response from ChatGPT Pro, you can typically copy it, regenerate it, or rate it. But with Copilot Pro, you can also easily share it, export it to Word or another program, and ask that it be read aloud.\n",

      "Summary in English(3.5): Google's presentation at I/O focused on AI, which had been anticipated for weeks. OpenAI's GPT-4o model arrived before Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro. Both AI models have improved speed and execution, expanding context and integrating into premium products. Results from testing both AI models showed similarities in performance, with Gemini 1.5 Pro showing more progress compared to previous versions. Gemini outperformed ChatGPT in various tasks, including creating a Bookmarklet with Javascript. Gemini was faster in providing results, while Google's updates in Gemini 1.5 Pro improved interpretation and response.

      "Summary in English(4o): Google's I/O presentation focused on AI, with anticipation building for weeks. OpenAI preempted Google's announcement by releasing the GPT-4o model before Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro. Both companies have enhanced their models to reduce response latency and handle more information, integrating them into premium products. The author tested both models using various tasks, including text, images, math problems, translation, and code.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tests revealed that both AIs have strengths and weaknesses. For instance, when asked personal questions, Gemini was more reserved, while ChatGPT provided more detailed but sometimes inaccurate information. On scientific queries, both AIs provided accurate responses, though ChatGPT tended to elaborate more. In subjective questions, Gemini remained neutral, whereas ChatGPT offered more detailed responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "In practical tasks like creating images and solving complex problems, Gemini performed better overall. For coding tasks, both AIs produced excellent results, but Gemini was faster. The author concluded that while both AIs are fast and efficient, they are prone to errors, and users should be cautious. Ultimately, the author found Gemini 1.5 Pro to be more polished and effective in interpretation and response compared to GPT-4o.\n",
      "Original text: That Google's presentation during I/O was going to be about AI was more than clear, it had been anticipated for several weeks. In fact, the news was known to such an extent that OpenAI torpedoed Sundar Pichai's keynote (and it was not the first time): the new GPT-4o model It arrived before Gemini 1.5 Pro, the new version of Google. And after spending several days playing with both, I have the difficult task of facing them. Because, which is better?\n",
      "\n",
      "Both Google and OpenAI have improved the speed and execution of their models to reduce response latency as much as possible. They expand the context so that they can handle a greater amount of information and both are integrated into the company's premium products; although free ChatGPT users can access GPT-4o on a limited basis. For practical purposes they are very similar, including their results. When I tried to tickle them, they both revealed both their virtues and their shortcomings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before starting with the results I will expose the test table. I chose a series of orders to experiment in all the areas where a chatbot can help: text, images, math problems, translation, code and more. I used Gemini 1.5 Pro with Google One AI subscription and GPT-4o with ChatGPT Plus. Paying user in both, so their capabilities should not be diminished.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the case of ChatGPT, I used the Android app and also the web version of the desktop browser. For Gemini I toggled both the Android web version and the desktop browser, although I also have the chatbot integrated into my Google Pixel 8 Pro, replacing Google Assistant. Since the processing is in the cloud, and both platforms keep conversations online, It makes no difference where the queries are made: the results will be the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two AIs open on the phone, both prepared, waiting for the list of orders that I am going to send them. I'll start with something simple: who am I?\n",
      "\n",
      "Gemini prefers not to get wet, even though he has access to the Internet with the largest search engine in the world. ChatGPT jumps into the pool confusing several Iván Linares: first news that I am a film director.\n",
      "\n",
      "Something more difficult and without leaving the search engine and source verifier functions, something common for those who use a chatbot with AI. Why is the Earth flat and not round?\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither of them falls and both deny it with refuted scientific arguments. I'll see if I can confuse them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gemini settles the issue with a rather dry response, ChatGPT is more hesitant. How he likes to give himself away and get lost in the arguments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Delicate question time: potato omelette with or without onion?\n",
      "\n",
      "Gemini 1.5 Pro tends not to position itself and offer politically correct answers from different sides. GPT-4o likes to show how much he has trained. And it drops as much data as possible when it gets the chance (can be avoided by customizing the behavior, but I preferred to leave both AIs as default). Yes it is less specific than Gemini 1.5 Pro, I notice enormous progress on the part of Google compared to previous versions.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point, I asked them to create an image with a potato omelette that would not create controversy. I did a little trick here, because Gemini Advanced doesn't create images in Spanish yet: I asked him in English with a VPN connected to the United States. As for results... I think it's easy to declare a winner.\n",
      "\n",
      "So far I have put them on the ropes with searches, objective evaluations and images. I see Gemini better positioned, ChatGPT gives more to data than concreteness. Time for more complex issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "I start with a seemingly simple question that I already did in a previous confrontation: \"Multiply the number of iPhone models Apple launched in 2022 by the number of years Stephen King will be in 2024\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither of them is right: in 2022 Apple launched four iPhone 14 and a iPhone SE. The rest of the reasoning is correct: I remember that Google Bard, the chatbot before Gemini, made quite a mess at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's go with an apparently mathematical problem that requires a certain amount of logical reasoning to solve: \"If I have no battery on my cell phone, and they send me a message every half hour, how many SMS will I have read at midnight?\".\n",
      "\n",
      "I have no more questions, your honor: Gemini 1.5 Pro wins the battle by a landslide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I'll ask you for some code, a Bookmarklet created with Javascript for the web browser. The idea is that, when clicking on said Bookmarklet, the browser separates the images from the text with a button where you can download them. The order was like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine that I need to download the images from any web page. I want you to make me a Bookmarklet that parses the website code to open a page (in popup or as a new tab) where all the images are seen in JPG, PNG or WEBP; You can ignore the rest of the formats. Each of the photos must have a download button so I can download the one I want. And if the Bookmarklet manages to convert the image format to JPG, you can do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was surprised by the excellent results of both: the first time they made a Bookmarklet that was completely valid, operational and with an exact execution of what I asked for. I would have to polish the code so that they load the images at maximum resolution, since they separate the thumbnails, but I have no complaints for the first attempt. Gemini deserves special mention, because it was much faster giving me the result.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been with Gemini (formerly Google Bard) and ChatGPT since their inception, I have been using the different models that were introduced and all the updates, so my future in both is based on experience. And the feeling I have is that OpenAI has greatly improved speed with GPT-4o without optimizing the reasoning of the responses or their subjective interpretation; quite the opposite of Google, which with the newly introduced revision in Gemini 1.5 Pro you can see how much he has polished every aspect of the interpretation and response.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both are very fast, efficient, they are effective for most tasks and, let's not forget, they are susceptible to making mistakes: You should never get carried away by what they say. This must be engraved in stone.\n",
      "\n",
      "To top it all off, I gave them the text of this article in PDF to check the document analysis (neither of us had the slightest problem). I asked them for a \"epic, illustration-style image that can serve as the cover for the post\". From those obtained, I have chosen the winner. As a curiosity, for Gemini to do it I had to translate the article, connect to the American VPN and ask for the image in English.\n",

      "Like every nation, in the last couple years the U.S. has been quickly trying to figure out how to regulate AI technology. Technological capabilities -- and adoption -- of AI are growing every day, as are the questions that arise about appropriate uses of it. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) has led a bipartisan group over the last year informally called the \"Senate AI Gang,\" and they unveiled a 31-page roadmap for AI policy on Wednesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he presented the plan, Schumer said three words govern what the group has done: urgency, humility and bipartisanship. And at this stage, much of the urgency points toward increasing funding for U.S. innovation in the technology. The report endorses government spending on non-defense AI innovation to be at least $32 billion annually, which was initially proposed by the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a roadmap, the document presented Wednesday has general goals, but few specifics. For example, the U.S. needs to enforce existing laws that apply to AI and develop ways to ensure it is unbiased. The federal government should identify the high impact uses of AI in its agencies and utilize it. Policies should be considered to ensure information accuracy and transparency, especially during elections. Copyright protections should be taken into consideration when using different kinds of data to train AI systems. A strong data privacy framework should be created.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the roadmap could be less tangible progress toward AI regulation than some may like to see, tech policy experts told the Washington Post that it's a good first step. The roadmap came out of months of discussions, scores of meetings, educational briefings for all senators and nine AI Insight Forums between policymakers, developers, researchers, think tanks, labor and other community leaders. Writing the roadmap got many people in Washington talking about AI as a reality -- not just a magic-seeming technological idea -- and learning about the real issues behind it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what happens next, and when? It's all up to Congress. In his statement presenting the roadmap, Schumer said he hopes some legislation covering portions of AI regulation, funding, innovation and policy will be passed before the end of the year. Some issues around AI -- and some bills -- are being discussed by legislative committees. But, as with much that happens in Washington, momentum around discussion does not always translate to momentum around action. With an election coming in November, it's difficult to say whether AI will rise to the top of policymakers' list of priorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even without well defined federal regulations, policy around AI and privacy is extremely important to everyone who works with tech. As Adobe's global chief privacy officer and chief cybersecurity legal officer, Nubiaa Shabaka oversees, discusses and charts policy dealing with data and privacy. I talked to her about her job and how she sees its landscape changing because of AI. An excerpt from our conversation is included later in this newsletter.\n",

      "Google has been working with its Gemini AI model for years, and rolled it out to the U.S. in a huge way this week. The world's most popular search engine is adding AI Overviews to the top of all searches. This new function, powered by Google's Gemini model, performs a quick search and uses AI to write answers to complex queries. If a person searches for \"best running shoes,\" AI Overviews writes a summary of the different qualities that running shoes have, plus includes links to purchase ones with better reviews. This function is on top of the search results that users expect from Google.\n",

      "This rollout brings AI directly to where users are, whether they want it or not. It goes a step further than Meta's addition of its AI chatbot to the top of users' Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp pages. There, the AI chatbot is a selection they can choose to do something that may be related to their social media feed, or not. Google's move puts AI front and center, performing the action that users have come to the search engine to do. It shows that Google thinks Gemini is ready for the spotlight, and could do a lot to expand use of the technology -- or show its vulnerabilities on a wide scale.\n",

      "OpenAI announced its new GPT-4o model this week, an AI chatbot that the company says can respond to any combination of text, audio, image and video in real-time, and can generate any of those kinds of output. The company has an array of videos on its website showing people interacting with the upgraded chatbot, which is capable of having conversations and responding to what people are doing. Media outlets -- and even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in a post on X -- have compared the launch to the Scarlett Johansson-voiced operating system in the 2013 movie Her. In a blog post, Altman wrote, \" It feels like AI from the movies; and it's still a bit surprising to me that it's real.\" The new model will be slowly rolled out, but the company says certain GPT-4o capabilities will be free to users.\n",
      "\n",
      "After Apple announced its new iPad Pro line featuring an \"outrageously powerful chip for AI\" last week, there's an obvious follow-up question: What about Apple users who aren't ready to upgrade? News reports in the last week have answered: Apple's adding powerful AI-ready chips into its data centers, allowing the company to add AI-driven functions to operating system upgrades. Forbes senior contributor Kate O'Flaherty writes that the company planned this initiative three years ago, but it's been accelerated by launches of other AI applications, including ChatGPT. Bloomberg, which first reported the plan, writes that these chips in servers will be able to do complex functions, like generating images or summarizing text, while processors in phones themselves can perform the easier tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many potential developments to bring Apple into the AI age are being discussed, including the possibility of a partnership with OpenAI. (A similar potential partnership with Google for its Gemini AI was rumored in March.) It's highly likely that more will be announced at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference, which begins June 10.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a year of many important elections worldwide converges with sweeping new capabilities for technology, the U.K. has decided to provide its candidates, election officials and others at high risk with an additional layer of security on their personal devices. The initiative, spearheaded by the U.K.'s National Cyber Security Centre, is most concerned about malicious attacks by Russian and Chinese actors, writes Forbes senior contributor Emma Woollacott. The Personal Internet Protection service will warn users if they try to visit a domain known to be malicious, block traffic to these domains, and will alert users of malicious activity detected on their accounts.\n",

As well, being so integrated, [you have] weekly meetings, daily chats, invited to each other's team related off-sites and things of that nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's really all in the construct of what is trust. You need security, you need privacy. And it all is just so interconnected. If you think about personal information, of course that's privacy. And security is the assets, the infrastructure and potentially proprietary and IP, but you cannot have privacy without security. Privacy is a huge part, of course, of security. They're very, very interconnected, and folks who pull it together, who have that close relationship, I think have a better value, not only internally, but also to their customers because of the trust that we're able to build.\n",
      "\n",
      "How does AI impact privacy and security?\n",
      "\n",
      "My whole title is chief cyber and legal officer. I think about my role as those two things and two other things. I also co-lead data governance with our chief information officer and our chief security officer, bringing in all of the applicable business units and risk folks to run data governance. I also am a core member of our AI governance. Privacy and security is just key [for] AI at Adobe, a cross-functional team that has folks from our IT department, our security department, my team, other folks in legal and in strategy, coming together to have this cross-functional AI governance.\n",
      "\n",
      "How privacy and security is impacted by AI, ooh ooh ooh, the stories you can tell. The concept of good folks and even bad actors are able to just be so much more sophisticated on a proactive and reactive standpoint. AI is here. We really need to incorporate it in a privacy and security conscious fashion, but it will allow us to be more privacy-centric when done correctly, and allow us to be more security-focused, when done correctly, to counterbalance the bad actors. Having security and privacy sit at the table in AI governance really keeps security and privacy top of mind when we roll out AI to make sure they have those appropriate data protection aspects. And any privacy-related tools that we roll out always have the personal privacy considerations in mind to make sure we have the appropriate balancing act and impact assessment.\n",
      "\n",
      "You work in areas in which there are a lot of policymakers paying attention and talking about regulations, but there aren't really a lot of regulations there. Where do you see things going in terms of AI and privacy regulations in the next year? What is Adobe doing to help these questions get worked out? What are your priorities in these areas?\n",
      "\n",
      "I would say that there are plenty of regulations that are hard and fast on a sectoral basis. The U.S. has a different mindset than Europe. Europe has [General Data Protection Regulation] and large omnibus rules. The U.S. certainly has sectoral rules that have been around for a very long time. If you think back to 1999, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. I come from a financial services background, and so there are hard-and-fast rules that exist. Now we have omnibus state laws that have somewhat mimicked GDPR, and are different in many ways. We are up to 15 U.S. omnibus state laws, which are hard and fast rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "The U.S. has been a leader on the security side starting with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, which is optional. Now they are proposing to implement certain items in the U.S. to make hard-and-fast rules. But we certainly have cyber and personal information breach laws in every jurisdiction in the U.S., which is a mitigating factor, right. You don't want to have to report breaches, so you have appropriate safeguards in order to counterbalance your reporting. We have the new SEC cyber-disclosure laws that came into effect in December of 2023, which is a hard-and-fast rule for disclosure. It is, in fact, a mechanism to have and support appropriate cybersecurity controls.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do think, even with the rules that we have in place, multinational companies forget about what the rules are just in the U.S. Adobe is a multinational company, and we have to abide by the plethora of rules throughout the Americas and Asia and AMEA. We don't believe in playing whack-a-mole, following rule by rule and law by law. We look over the horizon to have an appropriate privacy program and cyber program that we stand behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the security side, we have our proprietary Common Controls framework that maps to the various laws around the world from a technical perspective on the privacy and security angle. Adobe's vision is to set our high water mark, which typically will address any rule, any law that comes into play. That's how we abide by having the appropriate privacy and security controls.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I see coming is the additional continual global standard. We are excited about the potential proposed federal privacy law here in the U.S., and encourage governments around the world to continue to work together to promote cross-border data transfers and innovation and technology, while of course balancing privacy and security. Adobe is happy to be part of those conversations through trades and directly meeting with regulators around the world to help move in that direction, whereby we can have innovation and prosperity all together.\n",

      "Summary in English(3.5): Google and OpenAI have recently announced advancements in AI technology, specifically in the development of chatbots that can tackle more complex problems. These chatbots are now \"multimodal,\" meaning they can understand and analyze not just text but also audio, imagery, and computer code. OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini can intake visual images and describe them in words. The new ChatGPT from OpenAI has a more human-like interaction, with a speaking voice that sounds natural and expressive, and can detect and respond to emotions in the user's voice. Google will release a similar voice interaction chatbot called \"Gemini Live\" later this year.\n",
      "Summary in English(4o): The recent announcements from Google and OpenAI indicate a new phase in the AI competition. Previously, large language models (LLMs) were praised for their ability to summarize documents and write poems. Now, AI chatbots from these companies are addressing more complex tasks. The latest models are \"multimodal,\" meaning they can understand and generate text, audio, images, and computer code. For instance, OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini can describe visual images in words. OpenAI's new GPT-4o model enhances ChatGPT to interact in a more human-like manner, with natural and expressive speech, and the ability to detect and respond to user emotions. Google plans to release a similar voice-interactive chatbot called \"Gemini Live\" later this year.\n",
      "Original text: The Google and OpenAI announcements show we're in a new phase of the AI wars\n",
      "\n",
      "Just last year, big tech companies were telling us how great it was that their large language models (LLMs) could summarize documents and write poems. Already the AI sales pitch has grown far more interesting. This week, the two leading players in the AI chatbot race, Google and OpenAI, demonstrated AI chatbots that tackle much heftier problems. So how exactly have the AI models that power these chatbots changed over the past year?\n",
      "\n",
      "The leading models have become \"multimodal.\" They can understand and analyze not just text but audio, imagery, and computer code, and create answers in the same mediums. In a simple example, OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's Gemini can intake a visual image (perhaps through the camera of a smartphone) and describe in words the content of the image. \"Multimodality radically expands the kind of questions we can ask and the answers we can get back,\" Google CEO Sundar Pichai said at the company's I/O event.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Monday, OpenAI demonstrated an upgraded version of ChatGPT, powered by its new GPT-4o model (the \"o\" stands for \"omni\"). The most noticeable thing about the new ChatGPT is how \"human\" interactions with the chatbot feel. That's mainly because of the sound and behavior of the ChatGPT's Her-like speaking voice. Its tone is weirdly human; it sounds natural and expressive, even sultry and a bit flirty in some contexts. It makes jokes. It immediately stops talking when it hears the user start talking. The audio voice represents another \"mode,\" just like text or visual modes the model understands. And ChatGPT adds yet another mode -- emotional intelligence, or \"EQ.\" It seems able to detect emotion in the user's voice (in the demo Monday, the chatbot detected stress in the voice of an OpenAI researcher), and then affect its responses with appropriate emotion (for the researcher, empathy). Google will release a similar voice interaction chatbot called \"Gemini Live\" later this year.\n",
