        "body_eng": "WASHINGTON -- The 32 members of the NATO military alliance will meet in Washington next week to project a united front on Ukraine and its fight against Russian aggression, but there could be some fractures behind the harmonious facade.\n\nBulgarian President Rumen Radev last week refused to lead his country's delegation to the NATO summit due to disagreements with Bulgaria's position in support of Ukraine.\n\nSlovakia's prime minister, Robert Fico, claimed last month that he was the target of an assassination attempt because his opposition to arming Ukraine deviated from the European mainstream.\n\nAnd Hungary has continued to maintain close ties with Russia and resist pressure to help Ukraine economically or militarily. Prime Minister Viktor Orban urged Ukraine on Tuesday to consider a cease-fire to speed up peace talks.\n\nMore cracks in the alliance could emerge Sunday with the potential electoral triumph of France's main far-right party. The party, National Rally, has a history of pro-Russia sympathies, and last year abstained in a vote on France's security pact with Ukraine.\n\nOutgoing NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg acknowledged the split in opinion on Ukraine in a news conference with Orban in June but expressed optimism in the alliance ultimately standing together in solidarity.\n\n\"We are 32 allies, and sometimes there are different opinions, but we have proven again and again that we are able to overcome them and find a common way forward,\" he said.\n\nOrban has assured NATO that Hungary will not oppose the expected announcement next week of a new mission in Germany to coordinate aid to Ukraine as well as a long-term financial pledge by the alliance to provide military support. But Orban also made clear that Hungary will not contribute personnel or funds for the efforts.\n\nFor now, any disagreements among NATO allies concerning Ukraine seem to be superficial cracks in the veneer of the alliance rather than at its foundations, according to Sean Monaghan, a U.K. visiting fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.\n\n\"Gaining consensus in the face of differing national positions on critical issues is normal business for NATO, and I would expect any cracks to be patched up by the time we get to Washington next week,\" he said.\n\nThe main aim of the summit will be to maintain and show unity, especially as the alliance marks a landmark 75th anniversary while war rages in Europe, and its largest member -- the United States -- moves into a highly consequential presidential election, Monaghan said.\n\nThe public is unlikely to see the kind of discord that accompanied last year's summit in Lithuania, when open debate about Ukraine's future with the alliance caused Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to lash out in frustration, he said.\n\n\"We won't see any last-minute debates in public this time. We'll see a unified position on Ukraine,\" Monaghan said.\n\nBehind the scenes, countries such as Hungary and Slovakia could cause problems, but the biggest sources of potential obstacles will be the U.S. and Germany, said Luke Coffey, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank.\n\n\"Hungary and Slovakia are very loud with their rhetoric, but behind closed doors, they tend to be more cooperative and pragmatic. If we wanted to do something with Ukraine inside NATO, and the only voice against it was Hungary's, there are ways to make Hungary come around,\" he said. \"But if Berlin or Washington is against something, they're too big. They're too big to try to influence or persuade.\"\n\nWashington and Berlin are \"dead set against\" extending an invitation for Ukraine to join NATO, he said. However, support for arming Ukraine to repel Russia's invasion remains strong in NATO and is unlikely to change in the near term.\n\n\"Is the political will still there to do this? So far, I think the answer is yes,\" Coffey said.\n\nThat resolve is expected to continue even as various countries head to the polls. Coffey noted widespread fears in 2022 that the election of far-right leader Giorgia Meloni as Italy's prime minister would spell disaster for Ukraine never came to pass.\n\n\"Now, Italy is one of the strongest advocates for arming Ukraine,\" he said.\n\nThe glue holding the NATO alliance together ultimately goes beyond each member nation's shifting politics, Monaghan said.\n\n\"NATO is an alliance of liberal democracies,\" he said. \"The democracies have elections, and the positions of allies change, but I don't think they change so fundamentally to turn cracks into massive fissures. NATO is an alliance that's built on a community of shared values. It always has been, and I think it will continue into the future.\""

Both the Patriot and NASAMS systems have played a crucial role in Ukraine's ability to defend against Russian air attacks.\n\nThe Pentagon also announced a $150 million boost for Ukraine through the Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) package, which allows the DOD to draw directly from the U.S.'s stockpiles. The PDA package will include additional air defense interceptors, artillery and anti-tank weapons.\n\nAccording to the DOD's announcement, this is the 60th time that the Biden Administration has drawn from Washington's inventories for Ukraine since August 2021.\n\n\"Make no mistake, Ukraine is not alone, and the United States will never waver in our support,\" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said during a meeting with Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov at the Pentagon on Tuesday. \"Alongside some 50 allies and partners, we'll continue to provide critical capabilities that Ukraine needs to push back Russian aggression today and to deter Russian aggression tomorrow.\"\n\nUkraine is currently in possession of at least two Patriot missile defense systems -- one that was donated by the U.S., and another that was provided in partnership between Germany and the Netherlands. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that Kyiv needs at a \"minimum\" of \"seven more 'Patriots' or similar air defense systems\" in order to defend against Russia.\n\n\"[Russian President Vladimir] Putin must be brought down to earth, and our sky must become safe again...And it depends fully on your choice...[the] choice whether we are indeed allies,\" Zelensky during a speech to the NATO-Ukraine Council back in April, as reported by Reuters.\n\nThe U.S. first provided Ukraine with NASAMS systems in November 2022.

        "body_eng": "The motorcycle's growling engine was no match for the silent drone as it stalked Babenko. \"Push, push more. Pedal to the metal, man,\" his colleagues called out over a walkie-talkie as the drone swooped toward him. \"You're screwed, screwed!\"\n\nIf the drone had been armed with explosives, and if his colleagues hadn't disengaged the autonomous tracking, Babenko would have been a goner.\n\nVyriy is just one of many Ukrainian companies working on a major leap forward in the weaponization of consumer technology, driven by the war with Russia. The pressure to outthink the enemy, along with huge flows of investment, donations and government contracts, has turned Ukraine into a Silicon Valley for autonomous drones and other weaponry.\n\nWhat the companies are creating is technology that makes human judgment about targeting and firing increasingly tangential. The widespread availability of off-the-shelf devices, easy-to-design software, powerful automation algorithms and specialized artificial intelligence microchips has pushed a deadly innovation race into uncharted territory, fueling a potential new era of killer robots.\n\nThe most advanced versions of the technology that allows drones and other machines to act autonomously have been made possible by deep learning, a form of AI that uses large amounts of data to identify patterns and make decisions. Deep learning has helped generate popular large language models, like OpenAI's GPT-4, but it also helps make models interpret and respond in real time to video and camera footage. That means software that once helped a drone follow a snowboarder down a mountain can now become a deadly tool.\n\nIn more than a dozen interviews with Ukrainian entrepreneurs, engineers and military units, a picture emerged of a near future when swarms of self-guided drones can coordinate attacks and machine guns with computer vision can automatically shoot down soldiers. More outlandish creations, like a hovering unmanned copter that wields machine guns, are also being developed.\n\nThe weapons are cruder than the slick stuff of science-fiction blockbusters, like \"The Terminator\" and its T-1000 liquid-metal assassin, but they are a step toward such a future. While these weapons aren't as advanced as expensive military-grade systems made by the United States, China and Russia, what makes the developments significant is their low cost -- just thousands of dollars or less -- and ready availability.\n\nExcept for the munitions, many of these weapons are built with code found online and components such as hobbyist computers, like Raspberry Pi, that can be bought from Best Buy and a hardware store. Some U.S. officials said they worried that the abilities could soon be used to carry out terrorist attacks.\n\nFor Ukraine, the technologies could provide an edge against Russia, which is also developing autonomous killer gadgets -- or simply help it keep pace. The systems raise the stakes in an international debate about the ethical and legal ramifications of AI on the battlefield. Human rights groups and United Nations officials want to limit the use of autonomous weapons for fear that they may trigger a new global arms race that could spiral out of control.\n\nIn Ukraine, such concerns are secondary to fighting off an invader.\n\n\"We need maximum automation,\" said Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine's minister of digital transformation, who has led the country's efforts to use tech startups to expand advanced fighting capabilities. \"These technologies are fundamental to our victory.\"\n\nAutonomous drones like Vyriy's have already been used in combat to hit Russian targets, according to Ukrainian officials and video verified by The New York Times. Fedorov said the government was working to fund drone companies to help them rapidly scale up production.\n\nMajor questions loom about what level of automation is acceptable. For now, the drones require a pilot to lock onto a target, keeping a \"human in the loop\" -- a phrase often invoked by policymakers and AI ethicists. Ukrainian soldiers have raised concerns about the potential for malfunctioning autonomous drones to hit their own forces. In the future, constraints on such weapons may not exist.\n\nUkraine has \"made the logic brutally clear of why autonomous weapons have advantages,\" said Stuart Russell, an AI scientist and professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who has warned about the dangers of weaponized AI. \"There will be weapons of mass destruction that are cheap, scalable and easily available in arms markets all over the world.\"\n\nIn a ramshackle workshop in an apartment building in eastern Ukraine, Dev, a 28-year-old soldier in the 92nd Assault Brigade, has helped push innovations that turned cheap drones into weapons. First, he strapped bombs to racing drones, then added larger batteries to help them fly farther and recently incorporated night vision so the machines can hunt in the dark.\n\nIn May, he was one of the first to use autonomous drones, including those from Vyriy. While some required improvements, Dev said, he believed that they would be the next big technological jump to hit the front lines.\n\nAutonomous drones are \"already in high demand,\" he said. The machines have been especially helpful against jamming that can break communications links between drone and pilot. With the drone flying itself, a pilot can simply lock onto a target and let the device do the rest.\n\nMakeshift factories and labs have sprung up across Ukraine to build remote-controlled machines of all sizes, from long-range aircraft and attack boats to cheap kamikaze drones -- abbreviated as FPVs, for first-person view, because they are guided by a pilot wearing virtual-reality-like goggles that give a view from the drone. Many are precursors to machines that will eventually act on their own.\n\nEfforts to automate FPV flights began last year, but were slowed by setbacks building flight control software, according to Fedorov, who said those problems had been resolved. The next step was to scale the technology with more government spending, he said, adding that about 10 companies were already making autonomous drones.\n\n\"We already have systems which can be mass-produced, and they're now extensively tested on the front lines, which means they're already actively used,\" Fedorov said.\n\nSome companies, like Vyriy, use basic computer vision algorithms, which analyze and interpret images and help a computer make decisions. Other companies are more sophisticated, using deep learning to build software that can identify and attack targets. Many of the companies said they pulled data and videos from flight simulators and front-line drone flights.\n\nOne Ukrainian drone maker, Saker, built an autonomous targeting system with AI processes originally designed for sorting and classifying fruit. During the winter, the company began sending its technology to the front lines, testing different systems with drone pilots. Demand soared.\n\nBy May, Saker was mass-producing single-circuit-board computers loaded with its software that could be easily attached to FPV drones so the machines could auto-lock onto a target, said the company's CEO, who asked to be referred to only by his first name, Viktor, for fear of retaliation by Russia.\n\nThe drone then crashes into its target \"and that's it,\" he said. \"It resists wind. It resists jamming. You just have to be precise with what you're going to hit.\"\n\nSaker now makes 1,000 of the circuit boards a month and plans to expand to 9,000 a month by the end of the summer. Several of Ukraine's military units have already hit Russian targets on the front lines with Saker's technology, according to the company and videos confirmed by the Times.\n\nIn one clip of Saker technology shared on social media, a drone flies over a field scarred by shelling. A box at the center of the pilot's viewfinder suddenly zooms in on a tank, indicating a lock. The drone attacks on its own, exploding into the side of the armor.\n\nSaker has gone further in recent weeks, successfully using a reconnaissance drone that identified targets with AI and then dispatched autonomous kamikaze drones for the kill, Viktor said. In one case, the system struck a target 25 miles away.\n\n\"Once we reach the point when we don't have enough people, the only solution is to substitute them with robots,\" said Rostyslav, a Saker co-founder who also asked to be referred to only by his first name.\n\nOn a hot afternoon last month in the eastern Ukrainian region known as the Donbas, Yurii Klontsak, a 23-year-old reservist, trained four soldiers to use the latest futuristic weapon: a gun turret with autonomous targeting that works with a PlayStation controller and a tablet.\n\nSpeaking over booms of nearby shelling, Klontsak explained how the gun, called Wolly after a resemblance to the Pixar robot WALL-E, can auto-lock on a target up to 1000 meters away and jump between preprogrammed positions to quickly cover a broad area. The company making the weapon, DevDroid, was also developing an auto-aim to track and hit moving targets.\n\n\"When I first saw the gun, I was fascinated,\" Klontsak said. \"I understood this was the only way, if not to win this war, then to at least hold our positions.\"\n\nThe gun is one of several that have emerged on the front lines using AI-trained software to automatically track and shoot targets. Not dissimilar to the object identification featured in surveillance cameras, software on a screen surrounds humans and other would-be targets with a digital box. All that's left for the shooter to do is remotely pull the trigger with a video game controller.\n\nFor now, the gunmakers say they do not allow the machine gun to fire without a human pressing a button. But they also said it would be easy to make one that could.\n\nMany of Ukraine's innovations are being developed to counter Russia's advancing weaponry. Ukrainian soldiers operating machine guns are a prime target for Russian drone attacks. With robot weapons, no human dies when a machine gun is hit. New algorithms, still under development, could eventually help the guns shoot Russian drones out of the sky.\n\nSuch technologies, and the ability to quickly build and test them on the front lines, have gained attention and investment from overseas. Last year, Eric Schmidt, a former Google CEO, and other investors set up a firm called D3 to invest in emerging battlefield technologies in Ukraine. Other defense companies, such as Helsing, are also teaming up with Ukrainian firms.\n\nUkrainian companies are moving more quickly than competitors overseas, said Eveline Buchatskiy, a managing partner at D3, adding that the firm asks the companies it invests in outside Ukraine to visit the country so they can speed up their development.\n\n\"There's just a different set of incentives here,\" she said.\n\nOften, battlefield demands pull together engineers and soldiers. Oleksandr Yabchanka, a commander in Da Vinci Wolves, a battalion known for its innovation in weaponry, recalled how the need to defend the \"road of life\" -- a route used to supply troops fighting Russians along the eastern front line in Bakhmut -- had spurred invention. Imagining a solution, he posted an open request on Facebook for a computerized, remote-controlled machine gun.\n\nIn several months, Yabchanka had a working prototype from a firm called Roboneers. The gun was almost instantly helpful for his unit.\n\n\"We could sit in the trench drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes and shoot at the Russians,\" he said.\n\nYabchanka's input later helped Roboneers develop a new sort of weapon. The company mounted the machine gun turret atop a rolling ground drone to help troops make assaults or quickly change positions. The application has led to a bigger need for AI-powered auto-aim, Roboneers CEO Anton Skrypnyk said.\n\nSimilar partnerships have pushed other advances. On a drone range in May, Swarmer, another local company, held a video call with a military unit to walk soldiers through updates to its software, which enables drones to carry out swarming attacks without a pilot.\n\nThe software from Swarmer, which was formed last year by a former Amazon engineer, Serhii Kupriienko, was built on an AI model that was trained with large amounts of data on front-line drone missions. It enables a single technician to operate up to seven drones on bombing and reconnaissance missions.\n\nRecently, Swarmer added abilities that can guide kamikaze attack drones up to 35 miles. The hope is that the software, which has been in tests since January, will cut down on the number of people required to operate the miniaturized air forces that dominate the front lines.\n\nDuring a demonstration, a Swarmer engineer at a computer watched a map as six autonomous drones buzzed overhead. One after the other, large bomber drones flew over a would-be target and dropped water bottles in place of bombs.\n\nSome drone pilots are afraid they will be replaced entirely by the technology, Kupriienko said.\n\n\"They say: 'Oh, it flies without us. They will take away our remote controls and put a weapon in our hand,'\" he said, referring to the belief that it's safer to fly a drone than occupy a trench on the front.\n\n\"But I say, no, you'll now be able to fly with five or 10 drones at the same time,\" he said. \"The software will help them fight better.\"\n\nIn 2017, Russell, the Berkeley AI researcher, released an online film, \"Slaughterbots,\" warning of the dangers of autonomous weapons. In the movie, roving packs of low-cost armed AI drones use facial recognition technology to hunt down and kill targets.\n\nWhat's happening in Ukraine moves us toward that dystopian future, Russell said. He is already haunted, he said, by Ukrainian videos of soldiers who are being pursued by weaponized drones piloted by humans. There's often a point when soldiers stop trying to escape or hide because they realize they cannot get away from the drone.\n\n\"There's nowhere for them to go, so they just wait around to die,\" Russell said.\n\nHe isn't alone in fearing that Ukraine is a turning point. In Vienna, members of a panel of U.N. experts also said they worried about the ramifications of the new techniques being developed in Ukraine.\n\nOfficials have spent more than a decade debating rules about the use of autonomous weapons, but few expect any international deal to set new regulations, especially as the United States, China, Israel, Russia and others race to develop even more advanced weapons. In one U.S. program announced in August, known as the Replicator initiative, the Pentagon said it planned to mass-produce thousands of autonomous drones.\n\n\"The geopolitics makes it impossible,\" said Alexander Kmentt, Austria's top negotiator on autonomous weapons at the U.N. \"These weapons will be used, and they'll be used in the military arsenal of pretty much everybody.\"\n\nNobody expects countries to accept an outright ban of such weapons, he said, \"but they should be regulated in a way that we don't end up with an absolutely nightmare scenario.\"\n\nGroups including the International Committee of the Red Cross have pushed for legally binding rules that prohibit certain types of autonomous weapons, restrict the use of others and require a level of human control over decisions to use force.\n\nFor many in Ukraine, the debate is academic. They are outgunned and outmanned.\n\n\"We need to win first,\" said Fedorov, the minister of digital transformation. \"To do that, we will do everything we can to introduce automation to its maximum to save the lives of our soldiers.\"\n\nWritten by: Paul Mozur and Adam Satariano"

The transferred amount should help the Ukrainian government finance critical budget expenditures, social benefits, and salaries for doctors and teachers.\n\nIn a veterinary clinic, a man cursed at doctor Oleksii Prytula, a veteran of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, when he apparently saw that he was wearing prostheses. The visitor wanted the vet to come to his dog.\n\nLater, a video of the man apologizing appeared online. He says he did not see that the vet was wearing prostheses. The doctor said he did not accept the apology.\n\nOn July 3, the Kyiv Court of Appeal left MP Mykola Tyshchenko under house arrest. The politician tried to appeal against the preventive measure imposed on him on June 25 after a conflict with a former military officer in Dnipro.\n\nThe lawyers said that there were not enough MPs in the parliament, to which the judge replied: \"There are also not enough judges, but we are working somehow.\"\n\nBloomberg, citing European officials, writes that Chinese and Russian companies are developing a drone analogous to Iran's Shahed attack drone. This indicates that Beijing is preparing to transfer lethal weapons to Moscow, as Western officials have previously warned, the journalists say."

        "body_eng": "Know what moves the world. Stay informed with Kompreno. Get quality journalism from across Europe.\n\nRussia continues to destroy Ukraine, and the West and Ukraine are footing the bill. Meanwhile, the G7 countries have frozen $300 billion of Russian assets in their banks but cannot make the jump to seize them to help Ukraine's fight.\n\nWhy the holdup? Euromaidan Press explains in collaboration with the International Center for Ukrainian Victory.\n\nNot fully. First, we cannot fully calculate the extent of damage; second, human lives are priceless. After Ukraine's victory, much will remain to be done to bring Russia to justice. But right now, the G7 have frozen Russian assets in their countries, which can be fully used. However, even now, they are already less than the damages suffered by Ukraine, and the size of the damages is still growing.\n\nThe biggest slice of the pie is Russian state assets (reserves of the Russian Central Bank, Russia's central financial institution) - $300 billion. They've been frozen in banking institutions across the G7 countries.\n\nSo why are these assets parked there in the first place?\n\nWell, at the time of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia kept some assets in money and securities abroad in reliable banks, scooping up foreign currency.\n\nWe know for a fact that the lion's share of these assets, €192 billion to be precise, is held in Euroclear, a financial institution headquartered in Brussels that specializes in the safekeeping and settlement of securities.\n\nAs for the rest of the assets, their exact size and location are a bit of a mystery since that information is classified, but it's a safe bet that a hefty chunk is in the USA.\n\nThere are also Russian private assets floating around abroad, like yachts and businesses belonging to Russian oligarchs and propagandists.\n\nBut the total value of these is way smaller than the $300 billion in state assets, and confiscating them is a whole other can of worms. Each country has to make its own call on the matter, and then there's a court procedure to go through for each individual case, which is going to take a while.\n\nIt is also very difficult because the human rights of Russians owning them should be complied with, and the highest legal standards should be applied. That's why the spotlight is on the state assets, given Ukraine's urgent military and reconstruction needs. Confiscating these will be a quicker process.\n\nThis step falls under the category of countermeasures against an aggressor state that has launched an aggressive war and is violating international law left and right. Western countries have already frozen these funds based on this logic, but they haven't quite mustered up the resolve to fully confiscate them and hand them over to Ukraine.\n\nThere have been plenty of times throughout history when states have frozen the assets of other countries as a response to aggression:\n\nBut actually confiscating those assets and transferring them to the victim country? That's a lot rarer.\n\nHistorically, this has always been part of a post-war settlement, like the Treaty of Versailles after World War I or Germany's and Japan's World War II reparations. Directly confiscating frozen assets and handing them over to the victim country while the conflict is still ongoing? That's uncharted territory.\n\nIf the proposed use of frozen Russian assets for Ukraine's reconstruction actually happens, it would be a pretty big deal in this regard, but there are solid grounds for it.\n\nRussia stands accused of committing genocide in Ukraine and has caused mind-boggling damage to its infrastructure.\n\nThe reconstruction bill already stands at a whopping $486 billion, according to the World Bank. The damage to Ukraine's power grid is especially severe, with Russian strikes destroying 70% of its generating capacity.\n\nUkraine does not insist that this money is simply given to Ukraine; rather, the plan is to make the funds work for Ukraine's defense, which is the top priority. There are a few ways this could play out:\n\nUkraine is pushing for the ability to buy domestically-produced weapons with these funds, which are less expensive than western-made ones. They're also beefing up their capacity to handle the funds by ramping up anti-corruption measures.\n\nBeyond defense, the Russian funds are likely to be used for reconstruction and compensation for victims, although the exact breakdown isn't clear yet.\n\nOne big step forward to the confiscation of these funds was the US passing the REPO (Russian Elites, Proxies, and Oligarchs) Act on 23 April 2024.\n\nWhile successfully implementing it depends on further actions and certifications, the REPO Act lays out a legal mechanism for asset confiscation, gives the President the power to start the confiscation process, and allows for coordination with G7 countries, the EU, and other partners. It could potentially give Ukraine access to an estimated $5-8 billion in Russian sovereign assets located in the US.\n\nHowever, the G7 did not follow the US's lead.\n\nInstead, on 3 May 2024, the Financial Times reported that the G7 was no longer considering a full confiscation of frozen Russian assets, with an official saying that these assets could be used as leverage in potential peace negotiations with Russia.\n\nThis stance fails to recognize Russia's true objectives and the pointlessness of using these assets as a bargaining chip, given Russia's continued escalation of aggression and substantial revenues from fossil fuel exports.\n\nSeveral initial steps have been taken to ensure that Russia's frozen funds are already benefiting Ukraine:\n\nThis loan would allow Ukraine to survive. However, it would not ensure that Russia is punished for its crimes against mankind, ensure Ukraine's victory, or compensate Ukraine for the massive damages Russia caused.\n\nWhile Ukraine is set to receive portions of the frozen Russian assets, the entire $300 billion would be a game-changer. To put this sum into perspective:\n\nThis funding would allow the West to shift from \"drip-feeding\" weapons to a more impactful \"shock and awe\" support strategy. It would ensure a stable supply of ammunition and weapons, addressing the kind of shortages that led to Russian gains in spring 2024 when US aid was delayed.\n\nEconomist Timothy Ash argues that for Ukraine to pose a serious challenge to Russia, Western aid needs to increase from $100 billion to $150 billion annually. He suggests that using the confiscated assets is:\n\nIn essence, this massive injection of funds could provide Ukraine with critical resources while easing the financial burden on Western taxpayers.\n\nWhat could Ukraine do with $300 billion in Russian assets?\n\nTo put this sum into perspective, let's look at the numbers:\n\nInterestingly, with these resources, Ukraine has managed to destroy Russian equipment worth an estimated $98.7 billion - nearly double the value of their own arsenal (check out how we made these estimates here).\n\nIf Ukraine were to receive the full $300 billion, it could potentially increase its military capacity by almost six times. Of course, this is a simplification, as factors like equipment availability also play a role.\n\nSo, what could Ukraine actually buy with this money? According to defense expert Ivan Kyrychevskyi, here's a potential shopping list:\n\nKyrychevskyi estimates this funding could provide Ukraine with a 5-year security cushion. However, he cautions that even with money available, acquiring weapons isn't always straightforward due to availability issues and rising prices.\n\nRussia has already been forcing sales of Western assets at knock-off prices, as well as imposing punitive taxes on Western enterprises for a while now, way before any talk of confiscating Russian assets started:\n\nReports show that Russia had also basically stolen assets from a bunch of other Western companies by handing them over to state-owned enterprises or Putin's buddies' businesses for super cheap:\n\nRussia did all this in violation of international investment law, so Western companies have every right to hit back. Plus, the longer Western companies stay in Russia, the more likely it is that their assets will get snatched up or sold for peanuts.\n\nSo playing nice with Russia on this issue probably won't do much to protect Western investments anyway.\n\nRussia will definitely try to challenge the confiscation of its assets in court, because it can. It will likely file lawsuits in various courts like the EU Court of Justice, the European Court of Human Rights, the International Court of Justice, and international investment arbitration tribunals.\n\nBut here's the thing - Russia's chances of actually winning these cases are really low.\n\nAt the end of the day, if asset confiscation measures are well-designed and clearly based on Russia's well-documented violations of fundamental international laws and norms, they will have a strong legal foundation to withstand Russia's legal challenges. Careful legal framing can make the measures even more bulletproof.\n\nSo while Russia will certainly use whatever legal options it has to fight back, its own blatant disregard for international law leaves it without a strong legal case.\n\nThe only courts where Russia is likely to win are Russian ones, and then the decision will apply to the territory of Russia. So, theoretically, Western companies that are still doing business in Russia can be affected, but as we've already seen, Putin's regime can confiscate their assets without any legal pretexts anyway, so it would be wiser for them to simply get out of Russia.\n\nSome worry that confiscating Russian assets might hurt the EU's economy. They think the euro could lose value if people start pulling their money out of banks.\n\nThere's a fear that other countries might get spooked, thinking their money isn't safe in EU banks anymore. This could cause financial trouble in the Eurozone. Big players like China, Saudi Arabia, and Indonesia have been lobbying against asset confiscation, worried about what it might mean for their own money.\n\nBut these fears might be blown out of proportion.\n\nHere's the thing: Russian assets are only on the chopping block because Russia invaded Ukraine. If you're not planning to invade anyone, you've got nothing to worry about. And if you are, perhaps you'll get second thoughts. Two birds with one stone.\n\nSome are particularly worried about China pulling its investments from Euroclear. But so far, China hasn't made any threats or official statements about doing this. And they haven't done anything like this in the past either.\n\nEconomist Timothy Ash points out that when the West froze Russian money two years ago, emerging economies did not react in any way.\n\nHe also says that even if countries like Saudi Arabia and China wanted to move their money elsewhere, there's really nowhere else to go. Western banks are still the safest and most reliable places to keep large amounts of money. The euro is still a superstar currency, used in countries with detailed banking laws and high standards to protect people's money.\n\nAsh adds that if a country did try to move its money, it would probably end up hurting itself more than anyone else. They could face sanctions from Western countries, see less economic growth, have less trade and investment, and even see oil and commodity prices drop. Countries like Saudi Arabia and China care a lot about keeping their economies stable, so they're unlikely to risk all that just to back up Russia.\n\nSo, while some people are worried, it's pretty unlikely that taking Russian assets would cause other countries to pull their money out of Western banks en masse. The potential downsides for countries trying to move their money, plus the lack of good alternatives to Western banks, make this scenario highly improbable.\n\nAt its core, the issue of confiscation comes down to political will.\n\nDespite the various reasons that are raised in discussions about confiscating Russian assets, the true answer is that Western countries still aren't fully convinced of Ukraine's eventual victory. As a result, they lack a clear strategy for ensuring Ukraine's success and Russia's defeat.\n\nThey want to maintain a window for future negotiations with Russia. They fear that asset confiscation will be perceived as a serious escalation and are reluctant to demonstrate strength. They are concerned about jeopardizing future business opportunities, hoping that the familiar world in which Russia was a business partner will eventually return.\n\nThe US Congress passing the REPO Act shows that asset confiscation is legally doable and can happen if the political will is there.\n\nDespite this big step forward, the G7 countries still haven't gathered the courage to do the same.\n\nRecent reports suggest that the G7 is backing off from fully confiscating frozen Russian assets, with some officials hinting that these assets could be used as a bargaining chip in potential peace talks with Russia. This attitude doesn't recognize the true nature of Russian aggression and the Kremlin's ultimate goal of replacing the rules-based order with a \"might makes right\" approach.\n\nUltimately, the West's hesitation to confiscate Russian assets comes from not being fully convinced that Ukraine will win in the end and not having a clear plan for making sure Ukraine succeeds and Russia loses.\n\nSome Western countries are still hoping to keep the door open for future negotiations with Russia, worried that taking their assets will be seen as a major escalation. They're also worried about losing out on future business opportunities, holding onto the hope that the familiar world where Russia was a business buddy will eventually come back.\n\nBut Russia's actions over the past two years have made it clear that it has no plans to return to the rules-based international order.\n\nIt's time for bold moves, and the G7 needs to find the courage to follow the US's lead in confiscating Russian assets. By doing this, they can show they're committed to Ukraine's victory, hold Russia accountable for its crimes, and make it crystal clear that aggression won't be tolerated in the 21st century.\n\nEverybody's support matters, and you can help! Raise your voice and tell your politicians, and especially G7 leaders, that the confiscation of Russian assets is a step towards justice, because Russia must pay for the crimes it has done. You could publish appeals to G7 leaders, tagging them, in social media requesting the confiscation of the funds. You could also contact your local politicians and ask them to ask the G7 leaders to give a green light to the confiscation of the funds."

        "body_eng": "In the crucible of the Ukraine conflict, Russian forces have embarked on a radical transformation of their armored warfare strategies. This evolution, epitomized by the emergence of advanced infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) and the so-called \"turtle tanks,\" reveals a broader strategic shift and underscores Russia's commitment to maintaining its military edge in an increasingly drone-dominated battlefield.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has entered a potentially perilous phase as Russia deploys a new generation of IFVs to the front lines. The BMP-3 and BMD-4M are not mere troop carriers; they represent the pinnacle of modern military engineering, bristling with firepower, agility, and robust armor designed to shield soldiers on the battlefield. Their introduction signals a profound shift in Russia's military strategy, raising concerns of further escalation in an already devastating conflict.\n\nIn tandem with this deployment, there has been a notable 20% increase in BMP-3 production by Kurganmashzavod, a powerhouse in Russia's defense industry. This translates to Russian forces receiving 50% more of these vehicles in 2024 compared to the previous year, highlighting the resilience of Russia's domestic military production despite severe international sanctions. The question arises: what capabilities do these new IFVs bring to the fight, and what are the potential consequences of their deployment on the battlefield?\n\nThe BMP-3 and BMD-4M are the backbone of Russia's mechanized infantry. To grasp their significance, one must understand the Soviet military doctrine that shaped their development. Post-World War II, the Soviet Red Army emphasized heavily armored formations capable of breaching enemy lines. This philosophy extended to their infantry fighting vehicles. The BMP-1, for example, was armed but vulnerable, sitting tall and unable to swim, making it an easy target.\n\nThe BMP-3, introduced in the 1980s, addressed these shortcomings with a design capable of conquering both water and mountainous terrain. It boasts a formidable 100mm main gun capable of firing high-explosive shells and anti-tank missiles, making it versatile enough to handle enemy troops, fortified positions, and tanks. Additionally, a 30mm autocannon and a coaxial 7.62mm machine gun provide a barrage of firepower against lighter targets and helicopters. The BMP-3's adaptability extends to its mobility with water jets for amphibious operations and a sophisticated suspension system for navigating rough terrain.\n\nThe BMD-4M, in contrast, traces its lineage to the Cold War's emphasis on airborne assaults. Designed to be lightweight and maneuverable, it can be parachuted into combat zones and dominate the battlefield once deployed. The BMD-4M retains the BMP-3's powerful armament but is enhanced with improved fire control systems for greater precision. It also features anti-tank guided missiles, offering substantial armor-piercing capabilities. Its lightweight design includes an NBC (nuclear, biological, chemical) protection system, safeguarding the crew from various threats.\n\nDespite their advanced design, the brutal realities of the Ukrainian conflict have tested these vehicles under harsh conditions. They have proven vulnerable to sophisticated anti-tank weapons and drone tactics employed by Ukrainian forces. In response, Russia's Kurganmashzavod is rapidly deploying upgraded versions of these IFVs to the front lines. Recent modifications include bar armor on the sides and cage structures over the turrets to deflect RPGs and drone-mounted explosives, enhancing their survivability.\n\nThese upgrades are complemented by the Nakidka thermal camouflage system, which reduces the vehicle's thermal signature, making it harder for enemy forces to detect. Additionally, the RP-377VM1L jamming system disrupts the communication between drones and their operators, potentially neutralizing drone threats. While these enhancements represent significant advancements, their real-world effectiveness remains to be fully tested.\n\nIn a fascinating adaptation to modern warfare, Russian forces have also introduced \"turtle tanks\" -- a peculiar yet effective response to the increasing threat posed by Ukrainian FPV drones. Initially, these tanks were local improvisations characterized by makeshift counter-FPV drone shelters fabricated from available materials. Early iterations featured simple metal sheets hastily affixed to the tanks, creating an armored shell designed to protect against drone attacks. Despite their rudimentary appearance, these modifications have proven remarkably effective in the field.\n\nFootage from late April captured a Russian armored assault near Krashna Harfa, showcasing a column of infantry fighting vehicles equipped with these counter-FPV shelters. The lead tank, protected by a cope cage, spearheaded the assault, effectively clearing mines with its plow before retreating to safety. This tactic underscores the tanks' dual role: mine clearance and providing cover for advancing units.\n\nBy early May, the design of turtle tanks had further evolved. Images from UAVs revealed T-62 tanks with hybrid shelters, combining chain link, grating, and reactive armor. These modifications illustrate a blurring of the lines between traditional cope cages and the new turtle shells. The incorporation of electronic warfare (EW) modules and mine plows underscores a comprehensive approach to battlefield threats.\n\nDespite these innovations, the turtle tanks are not invulnerable. Videos from May showed several instances of these tanks being damaged or destroyed by mines and FPV drone attacks. One particularly striking example involved a turtle tank immobilized by a mine, subsequently attacked by multiple FPV drones. This highlights a significant vulnerability: while the shells offer protection, they are not foolproof against concentrated attacks.\n\nThe proliferation of turtle tanks across various Russian units, including the 40th Naval Infantry Brigade, indicates a decentralized yet widespread adoption of this concept. This suggests that the Russian military recognizes the value of these modifications and is willing to experiment with different designs to enhance their effectiveness.\n\nHowever, the reliance on makeshift solutions also points to a potential weakness: the lack of a unified, centrally coordinated approach to countering drone threats. As the conflict continues, it is likely that both Russian and Ukrainian forces will continue to adapt their tactics, leading to an ongoing cycle of measure and countermeasure.\n\nThe introduction of these upgraded IFVs represents a double-edged sword. The additional armor and jamming systems provide critical defense against drone strikes and RPG attacks. However, their impact on the war's trajectory is uncertain. Ukrainian forces are likely to adapt their tactics, and these upgrades will not transform these IFVs into invincible war machines. Nonetheless, the improvements may offer enhanced protection for Russian troops, potentially reducing casualties and enabling more aggressive maneuvers.\n\nIn the evolving theater of modern warfare, the significance of drones has grown exponentially, transforming battle strategies and posing unprecedented challenges to traditional armored vehicles. Recognizing this paradigm shift, Russia has embarked on an ambitious project to revolutionize its military hardware, particularly its iconic T-90 series tanks, to counter the ever-increasing threat of drone warfare.\n\nThe T-90 series, a cornerstone of Russian military might, has undergone significant transformations to maintain its dominance on the battlefield. The latest iteration, the T-90M \"Proryv-3,\" showcases remarkable advancements in armor, firepower, and electronic warfare capabilities. This state-of-the-art tank is designed to adapt to the rapidly changing dynamics of modern conflict, where drones play a pivotal role in reconnaissance, surveillance, and offensive operations.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin himself has lauded the T-90M as the world's premier battle tank, a sentiment echoed by Russian state media following its deployment in Ukraine in late December 2022. This deployment marked a critical moment in Russia's military strategy, as the T-90M began to engage in active combat against sophisticated adversaries equipped with advanced anti-tank systems and precision-guided munitions.\n\nA recent photo circulating on Russian social media has captured the attention of military analysts worldwide. It depicts a T-90M tank fitted with a new anti-drone armor system, a significant departure from the previously seen \"cope cages\" on the tank's turret. This upgrade features symmetrical armor plates on either side of the turret, a design aimed at enhancing the tank's resilience against drone strikes.\n\nThese modifications are not merely cosmetic; they represent a meticulously engineered response to the growing prevalence of FPV (First-Person View) drones. The new armor plates, positioned approximately 20 inches above the main armor, provide a robust shield against aerial attacks targeting the tank's turret. Additionally, the installation of a jammer on the turret's rear, protected by another armor plate, further strengthens the tank's defenses against drone-delivered ordnance.\n\nThe enhanced armor of the T-90M is a testament to Russia's commitment to staying ahead in the drone warfare game. These upgrades are tailored to mitigate the specific threats posed by drones, which have become a persistent challenge on the modern battlefield. However, the threat landscape is multifaceted. While these enhancements improve the tank's survivability against drones, they do not fully eliminate the risks posed by advanced anti-tank weapons such as the FGM-148 Javelin or the Bonus and SMArt 155 submunitions.\n\nThe strategic importance of these upgrades cannot be overstated. By bolstering the T-90M's armor and integrating advanced electronic countermeasures, Russia aims to enhance the tank's operational effectiveness and longevity in combat. The new design also ensures comprehensive protection for critical components such as the engine and transmission, further safeguarding the tank's mobility and functionality.\n\nDespite these advancements, the real-world efficacy of these upgrades remains to be thoroughly tested in active combat scenarios. The success of the T-90M's new armor system will depend on its ability to withstand the multifaceted threats it faces, from drone strikes to advanced anti-tank missiles. Military analysts speculate that these modifications represent the initial phase of a broader strategy to modernize Russia's armored fleet, with the potential for similar enhancements to be applied to other tanks, such as the T-72B3, in the near future.\n\nThe transformation of Russian armored tactics in the Ukraine war, exemplified by the development and deployment of turtle tanks and advanced IFVs, reflects a broader trend towards improvisation and rapid adaptation on the modern battlefield. These innovations, while effective to a degree, also expose new vulnerabilities and challenges. As both sides continue to evolve their strategies, the lessons learned from these adaptations will likely influence armored warfare tactics for years to come.\n\nThe BMP-3 and BMD-4M's upgrades are a clear indication that Russia is acutely aware of the changing dynamics of warfare and is taking proactive steps to ensure its armored vehicles remain formidable adversaries in the face of new and emerging threats. As the conflict in Ukraine continues to evolve, the effectiveness and impact of these formidable machines will undoubtedly play a crucial role in shaping its outcome.\n\n[Representational image, by Vitaly V.

        "body_eng": "New multi-country polling report reports sustained public support for the delivery of weapons and ammunition to Ukraine, but shows divisions on how the war will end - and the purpose of European aid.\n\nIt is published by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) on Wednesday, just ahead of the 2024 NATO Summit.\n\nIt suggests NATO leaders are unlikely to find domestic backing for troop deployments or increases in defence spending to assist the war effort.\n\nFollowing the dramatic delay of a critical US support package for Ukraine earlier this year, a political shift in Europe towards populist parties of the far-right, and the recent intensification of Russian military attacks against critical infrastructure in Ukraine, the report found that there has been no discernible collapse of morale in Ukraine or change in support for the Ukrainian war effort among its European allies.\n\nIt reveals, almost two and half years into Russia's invasion of the country, that a majority of Ukrainians (58%) believe they can secure a battlefield victory, and that confidence in the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the country's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, remains high. However, there are major divisions in Ukraine when it comes to prospective trade-offs that could bring an end to the conflict.\n\nThe study's authors and foreign policy experts, Ivan Krastev and Mark Leonard, believe looming divergences of opinion between European and Ukrainian publics could make finding agreement on how the war should end extremely challenging - and have significant impacts on Kyiv's pathway to NATO and EU accession.\n\nLeonard, co-author and founding director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, told this site: \"Our new polling suggests that one of the key challenges for Western leaders will be reconciling the conflicting positions between Europeans and Ukrainians on how the war will end. While both groups recognise the need for continued military provision, to help Ukraine push back at Russian aggression, there is a profound gulf around what constitutes a victory - and what the purpose of Europe's support actually is.\n\n\"While Europeans predominantly see a negotiated settlement as the most likely outcome, Ukrainians are not yet ready to countenance territorial trade-offs for NATO accession, nor engage with the idea of 'Finlandisation', in which they would keep their territory but forgo their EU and NATO ambitions.\"\n\nThe report is based on a public opinion poll of adult populations (aged 18 and over) conducted in May 2024 in 15 countries (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, Poland, Portugal, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and Ukraine). The total number of respondents was 19,566.\n\nThe poll was conducted online by Datapraxis and YouGov in the Czech Republic (9-16 May, 1,071 respondents), France (9-20 May, 1,502),Germany (9-17 May, 2,026), Great Britain (9-13 May, 2,082), Greece (1-16 May, 1,093), Italy (9-17 May, 1,036), Poland (9-23 May, 1,550), Portugal (9-20 May, 1,070), the Netherlands (9-15 May, 1,014), Spain (9-17 May, 1,508), Sweden (9-23 May, 1,026), and Switzerland (2-15 May, 1,079)."

        "body_eng": "Ann Marie Dailey serves as an engineer captain in the U.S. Army Reserves\n\nAnn Marie Dailey is an expert on some of the most pressing questions now facing the United States and its global allies: How to help Ukraine. What to expect from Russia. How to position NATO for the next 75 years.\n\nShe's a policy researcher at RAND and a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. For more than two decades, she has studied the political, military, and economic drivers that underpin global security. She served as a senior adviser to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs on both Russia and Ukraine, as well as on NATO relations with Ukraine and Georgia. She also joined the U.S. Army in 2015 and now serves as an engineer captain in the Reserves.\n\nIf you look at the battlefield, there's an artificial inflection point that's been brought about by the long delay in approving more U.S. aid to Ukraine. The Russians are going on the offensive. But if the Ukrainians are able to fend them off through the rest of 2024, then I think systemic factors are going to turn in Ukraine's favor. Russia will face increasing difficulties in its defense production, especially its production of armored vehicles. You'll see increasing U.S. and European production coming online. You'll see the introduction of F-16s, which will at least give Ukraine some additional flexibility. Ukraine's strategy through 2024 is going to be to play defense, and hopefully that puts them on a footing for a possible offensive in 2025.\n\nThere are people in Washington who say we can't keep supporting Ukraine because it undermines our ability to prepare for China. But if we're looking at a potential future conflict with China, there are two worlds we could fight it in.\n\nOne is a world in which Ukraine loses. In that world, all of our European allies are going to be laser-focused on protecting themselves from the next attack from Russia. The United States will be more diplomatically isolated, because those 31 NATO allies are going to be much more concerned about their own security than about helping the United States in a fight against China.\n\nThe other world is one in which Ukraine wins. Then you have a Ukraine that is going to be the largest and most capable army in Europe acting as a bulwark against Russian aggression. That gives you a strong European flank to the United States' east. You have countries that are confident not only in their own security but in the collective capability of NATO to deter and defeat aggression. They are going to be more willing to contribute if the U.S. finds itself in a war in the Indo-Pacific. This idea that somehow helping Ukraine leaves us less prepared for a war in China is just seeing the world as flat when it's not.\n\nIt needs to either bring them in or make it clear they're not going to be a member. Leaving them in diplomatic limbo just makes things worse for Ukraine and undermines NATO. Personally, I think Ukraine must become a member, but a bigger question right now is, What does NATO need to do to ensure Ukraine wins this war?\n\nA victorious, unified Ukraine would be the most capable military in Europe, and at that point it would just be foolish not to bring them in.\n\nIncrease its defense industrial base. As long as Russia sees that it's outproducing the combined capabilities of the United States and its European allies in NATO, it will see that it can continue to fight this war. As soon as the United States and Europe match those numbers, the calculus changes.\n\nI'd also like to see NATO air defenses providing a shield over western Ukraine. You've seen Russia fire missiles and attack drones that actually overfly NATO territory. And rather than air defenses from those nations firing at them and shooting them down, they've relied on Ukraine to use its air defenses to do that. The idea that you wouldn't protect NATO skies by engaging those missiles and drones -- it's not only not helping Ukraine, but it's undermining NATO's Article 5 deterrence. I'd also support France's proposal to start bringing troops into western Ukraine, far from the front lines, to provide training on the ground to Ukrainians.\n\nThe same way they've responded so far, which is with a lot of nuclear bluster. They know as soon as they mention tactical nuclear weapons, it will freeze decisionmakers in some capitals.\n\nWe're seeing an increase in threats below the level of military action -- massive amounts of disinformation, illicit finances being used to undermine political processes. NATO has been so successful over the past 75 years that its enemies are trying to use other ways to attack or undermine the alliance. It's going to struggle to define what constitutes an attack, and then to ensure it has the capabilities it needs to respond. You've seen China and Russia engage in these threats below the level of what you would consider conventional military actions. NATO needs to make itself a harder target by developing more capabilities that are below the threshold of direct military confrontation and demonstrating a willingness to use them. But it needs to do that while also upholding the democratic ideas of freedom and openness.\n\nI had considered joining at several points in my life. Then, in 2015, I was the senior adviser on Russia strategy, and I'd participate in these wargames, where Russia was attacking NATO. I was always advocating for more NATO forces forward and, in particular, more U.S. forces. We also consistently found that the U.S. Army had not nearly enough large-scale engineering capabilities. My mom used to always say, 'If you want something done right, then do it yourself.' I decided to join as an Army engineer, not just because I thought it was important for me personally. I was advocating moving forward U.S. military forces, essentially as a tripwire, and I wasn't comfortable doing that if I wasn't willing to put myself in that position.\n\nOne thing the Army has taught me is how the military approaches risk. It doesn't get to decide which missions to pursue. It just has to look at how to assess and mitigate risk, with the understanding that it will always have to accept a certain level of risk to complete the mission. That's something military leaders understand very well, but it's not necessarily deeply engrained in civilian culture. It's also helped me think more broadly about defense and security problems -- not just looking at things and platforms, but at people and leadership.\n\nI was a big Detroit Red Wings fan when I was a kid. Hockey fans might remember, back in the '90s, the Russian Five. It was this line of five Russian players who were brought to the Red Wings and ended up winning several Stanley Cups. Growing up, I would watch Tom Clancy films with my dad, where the Russians were always the bad guys; and then I would watch the Detroit Red Wings, where the Russians were the good guys. It caused this cognitive dissonance in my mind, this contradiction that I wanted to study more. So I pursued Russian studies and international relations in college, and I guess the rest is history."

        "body_eng": "As the conflict in Ukraine intensifies, the Western world confronts a pivotal moment that will define its global leadership for years to come. The decision to withhold military aid risks not only undermining solidarity but also signalling weakness that could embolden further aggression and escalate conflicts into neighbouring regions.\n\nWestern nations must understand the prolonged nature of the standoff with Russia. Doubts about Russia's future must be dispelled, and fears of its potential dissolution should not dictate policy. The current state of Russia, maintaining a quasi-imperial stance, poses significant threats to global security, including the uncontrolled proliferation of missile and nuclear technologies among adversarial states.\n\nFailure to support Eastern European democracies sends a clear message globally that the era of Western dominance in global affairs is waning. This reluctance could potentially lead to a new era of instability characterised by localised conflicts and the ominous spectre of a major global war, possibly involving nuclear weapons.\n\nThe current ceasefire in Ukraine may prove to be a precursor to potential broader global conflicts. Observers note with concern the West's apparent reluctance or inability to address global challenges. This hesitance emboldens proponents of global realignment, who are increasingly stirring conflicts in the Middle East, East and South Asia, and the Persian Gulf. Russia's actions in Ukraine serve as a catalyst, encouraging proxies worldwide to challenge the existing global order.\n\nThe West is currently being tested on its ability to confront contemporary challenges decisively. Failure to do so could lead to scenarios where critical international corridors, such as the Suwalki Corridor, will fall under threat, or where aggression against Baltic states becomes a reality.\n\nRussian society's deep-seated resentment and nostalgia for its former imperial status exacerbate global tensions. Western democracies must acknowledge their historical responsibilities and the immense international pressures they will face should they fail to adequately support Ukraine with the necessary military aid.\n\nReduced aid to Ukraine not only places the United States and other Western nations under international scrutiny but also shifts the burden of historical responsibility onto them for potentially exacerbating a global crisis.\n\nIt is crucial for NATO to maintain comprehensive support particularly through military aid to Ukraine. The economic and strategic costs of countering Russian ambitions in Ukraine far outweigh the costs of preventive measures.\n\nIt is not solely Ukraine's struggle; the democratic free world must adopt a resolute stance against the current regime in Moscow. This includes setting clear conditions for ending the conflict, maximising Ukraine's military capabilities, and diplomatically isolating Russia to prevent future aggression.\n\nTimely provision of arms and ammunition to Ukraine is critical to avoid scenarios where NATO must invoke Article 5 of its Treaty as a last resort.\n\nThe West faces a critical juncture where its decisions will resonate globally. By unequivocally supporting Ukraine with military aid it needs, the West can demonstrate its commitment to international stability and reaffirm its leadership in an increasingly tumultuous world. The consequences of indecision or half-hearted support would be catastrophic, spawning a dangerous new global order that would threaten peace and security worldwide."

        "body_eng": "To mark NATO's 75th Anniversary summit in Washington, D.C., the Quincy Institute invited leading U.S. and European analysts to comment on the future of the alliance. While differing greatly in their assessment both of NATO's role to date and of how they would like to see it develop in the future, all agree that NATO is facing an exceptionally difficult and dangerous period in its history.\n\nNATO likes to describe itself as \"the most successful alliance in history\" not because it won a war, but because during the Cold War it deterred a Soviet attack on Western Europe and thereby prevented a new world war. What is too often forgotten, however, is that war was prevented not just by NATO solidarity, but also by NATO caution. Successive U.S. administrations -- fully backed by their European allies -- rejected calls for aggressive policies aimed at \"rolling back\" Soviet power in Eastern Europe.\n\nSince the end of the Cold War, by contrast, NATO has become committed to rolling back Russian power even in former Soviet countries on Russia's own borders. As a result of the clash between this and Moscow's determination to maintain a sphere of influence, NATO now finds itself in a proxy conflict with Moscow on the European Continent itself. If this turns into direct war, there is a good chance that it will end with a nuclear exchange. At that point, the question of the future role of NATO will become meaningless, if only because there will be nobody left to ask it.\n\nIf direct war can be avoided, most analysts predict that mutual hostility between Russia and the West will continue for the foreseeable future, and will involve the risk of further clashes around Russia's borders -- for example, over the future of Belarus and Russian access to the exclave of Kaliningrad across NATO territory in Lithuania. How great this threat will be depends on how the war in Ukraine eventually ends, and whether it is through a compromise peace or a petering out into an endless semifrozen conflict.\n\nAnalysts agree that NATO's European members will definitely try to rearm, especially if Donald Trump is reelected and U.S. commitment to Europe seems uncertain. Their efforts in this direction will, however, be hampered by economic stagnation, the conflicting demands of increasingly endangered budgets for health and social welfare, and the resistance of European countries to pooling their military production. In an effort to please Washington and ensure that the U.S. maintains its military presence in Europe, NATO is also likely to make public gestures toward a global role and the containment of China.\n\nIf the U.S. does pull back from Europe to any significant extent, NATO is likely to abandon its expansionist program of recent decades and limit itself to the defense of its existing members. This shift would, however, lead to considerable tensions between NATO members over policy toward Russia.\n\nOne notable result of the war in Ukraine has been the almost complete disappearance from NATO discussions of the threat of climate change, previously described as \"existential.\" Nor does NATO have any strategy for the stabilization of countries to its south, or for addressing illegal migration across the Mediterranean. A few decades from now, however, the growth of these dangers may render many of NATO's existing preoccupations irrelevant.\n\n- Anatol Lieven, Eurasia Program Director, Quincy Institute\n\nSince the end of the Cold War, NATO has gone through many incarnations: NATO, the agent of transformation to bring Eastern Europe into the league of Western democracies. NATO, the fighter in the war against terrorism. NATO, the cybersleuth. The democracy-builder. The rules-based order enforcer.\n\nAnd finally, at its 75 anniversary, NATO seems to be going back to its original mission: a collective defense pact to keep Europe safe -- and Russia out.\n\nIt is not surprising that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has energized the organization and reaffirmed the importance of Article 5 to all member states, big or small. NATO is no longer \"brain-dead\" and certainly has the capacity to deter Russia from attacking its member states.\n\nBut there still is much to do for the alliance to retain its relevance into the future.\n\nThe first is creation of benchmarks and incentives for members to do more for their own defense, so Europe can reduce its reliance on the United States as its sole security guarantor. No matter who gets to the White House in November, American public sentiment is shifting in ways that are certain to have long-term implications for U.S. commitment to European security.\n\nAt a time when Washington views China and the Indo-Pacific as the foremost strategic challenge, Europeans need to develop industrial capabilities so as to have the freedom to make independent decisions for their own destiny. That inevitably means increasing military spending and manufacturing to complement the U.S. role in European security today and develop more autonomous reflexes tomorrow.\n\nNATO also needs to have a clear-eyed view of what its endgame in Ukraine is. Despite the slogan \"Ukraine's defense is Europe's defense,\" Ukraine's Western backers do not have a unified vision for where Ukraine fits in Europe's security. While supporting Ukraine's ability to defend itself against Russian aggression has been critical for the alliance, given that Russia is far from losing the war, it's time to start thinking of how this war ends -- in ways that preserve Ukraine's sovereignty and build a new security architecture for Europe.\n\nUkraine's theory of victory is increasingly looking unachievable to its Western backers. It's not hard to imagine negotiations for a ceasefire -- even with continued Russian occupation in parts of Ukraine -- at some point over the next few years. The U.S. and its allies need to be able to provide sufficient security guarantees for Ukraine, so its leaders and society have the confidence to accept a bitter peace -- and embark toward a more desirable future.\n\nThat means a smaller but stronger Ukraine -- and NATO can be a critical piece of that.\n\nWhat role NATO plays in negotiations to end the war will define the future of the alliance -- and the nature of strategic stability with a nuclear Russia. If NATO can play some role in the creation of a postconflict Ukraine, even in the absence of full membership for Ukraine, it will remain relevant in Europe's future security architecture.\n\nOf course, none of this might happen. Europe may remain divided on the question of strategic autonomy, with many member states following the U.S. lead on geopolitical challenges. There may not be consensus inside the alliance for an active role for an endgame in Ukraine -- leaving the matter entirely to Washington. America's strategic involvement with the Indo-Pacific might make individual member states more eager to strike bilateral arrangements with Washington -- hollowing out NATO's core mission or creating an internal constituency that wants to steer the alliance more toward greater competition with China.\n\nThat, I am afraid, would mean that NATO's perpetual search for a mission will continue into its fourth quarter-century and well into the next generation.\n\nAsli Aydintasbas is a Visiting Fellow at the Brookings Institution's foreign policy program and a Senior Associate Fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.'\n\nIn the European theater, conventional deterrence and defense should be ensured by Europeans. The 300,000 troops in a high state of readiness that the NATO New Force Model envisages on the eastern flank should be European troops. And they should need but a single American to be fully operational: SACEUR.\n\nAs it is, however, those 300,000 troops will still be dependent on American strategic enablers: intelligence, transport, deep strike, etc. Therefore, the European allies should go beyond the capability targets that NATO has currently assigned to them, and acquire all the necessary enablers themselves. That will undoubtedly require a collective effort, such as German Chancellor Scholz's Sky Shield initiative for a unified European air defense system.\n\nThat is where the European Union can help. Not in trying to align capability development and defense planning of its member states under the E.U. flag. After exactly 25 years (the Common Security and Defence Policy was launched in 1999), it is clear that nations do not want this. But the E.U. does have instruments that work, or can work: the European Defence Fund to invest in research and industry and the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) to build modular multinational capabilities. Those should be put to use to help the European allies build a comprehensive, full-spectrum force package within NATO.\n\nIf the Europeans managed to achieve this, this force package would constitute a tangible European pillar of NATO, in terms of capabilities. The U.S. should fully support such a move, and refrain from irritating allies by seeing everything in terms of defense industrial interests. If Europeans spend more money, of course they will want to spend more (not all) of that on European equipment. Washington needs Europe to do more, for it will free up conventional military resources for its own priorities in Asia, while the American nuclear umbrella remains the ultimate guarantee.\n\nIndeed, it is precisely because President Obama in 2012 already made Asia into the U.S.' No. 1 priority that Europeans must build a complete pillar within NATO. Twelve years later, it is about time the European allies stop convincing themselves that whatever happens, the U.S. cavalry will always be there. The reality is that in case of simultaneous wars in Europe and Asia, the U.S. is likely to prioritize the latter. Moreover, E.U. member states can only confidently support E.U. candidate country Ukraine (and Moldova and Georgia) without having to fear direct Russian retaliation, because NATO provides deterrence -- the conventional part of which Europeans must in the end ensure themselves.\n\nAn alliance that rests both on the U.S. and on an autonomous European pillar would be a much more balanced, and therefore more healthy alliance. But the Europeans should also build this pillar to prepare for less-healthy scenarios. If domestic politics lead the U.S. to reduce its commitment to NATO, the Europeans should be ready to seamlessly take over any task that the U.S. might withdraw from. Strategy is all about being prepared to uphold your interests, whatever comes to pass.\n\nProf. Sven Biscop is the Director of the Europe in the World program at Egmont -- The Royal Institute for International Relations in Brussels. He also lectures at Ghent University.\n\nAs with so much else, NATO's future will ultimately depend on the future America chooses for itself. American policymakers would do well to reconsider the wisdom of continuing the 80-year American military presence in Europe. One alternative would be to pursue a \"less-than-grand\" strategy of American engagement that focuses primarily on a regional security arrangement between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada in anticipation of China's rise. If the U.S. is unlikely to ever fully exit the North Atlantic alliance, it might, at a minimum, step aside from NATO's integrated military command, in the manner of Charles de Gaulle in 1966.\n\nGiven that it inhabits an entirely different part of the planet, Europe will naturally confront a set of different challenges from those facing the U.S. The most pressing, if various models are to be believed, will be the challenge posed by mass migration.\n\nFor Europe to have a happy future, it must tend to its own garden, and this necessitates a strategy of containing and mitigating the effects of climate migration. The strategy could be twofold: First, E.U. member states might set up a kind of climate mitigation fund for sub-Saharan Africa, which, in turn, would be coupled with a robust interdiction strategy against illegal migration in the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean.\n\nNATO, as currently conceived by transatlantic elites, is a danger to regional, and indeed, global stability: no NATO expansion, no war in Georgia in 2008; no NATO expansion, no war in Ukraine in 2022. Meanwhile, NATO's 2011 intervention in Libya resulted in the destruction of the Libyan state and mass migration flows across the Mediterranean.\n\nSen. Richard Lugar's indelible phrase, \"Out of area or out of business,\" implied that to survive, NATO had to go hunting for work outside of its borders -- and in the three decades that followed Lugar's recommendation, it did. But it turns out that there is plenty of \"in-area\" work for NATO to do -- only contrary to what transatlantic elites constantly tell us, that work doesn't have to do with the Russians. The threat to Europe's future will not come from its east, it will come from its south -- and the challenge will not be a military one. It will be humanitarian.\n\nTo successfully deal with this, NATO should adopt a medium- to long-term strategy of targeted devolution -- its primary focus would be to defend Europe's borders -- and therefore its prosperity, its identity, and its security. The idea that NATO now has to go further and further \"out of area\" to the Indo-Pacific, is deeply misconceived -- instead, in the coming decades NATO should transform itself into a pan-European coast guard and border patrol -- perhaps in some combination with the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) and the European Gendarmerie Force.\n\nIn the end, if NATO is to actually serve a useful role in securing Europe's future, it needs to abandon its pretensions of being a \"global policeman\" and become, instead, a cop on the beat.\n\nJames Carden is a contributing writer for foreign affairs at The Nation. He served as a policy advisor to the Special Representative for Intergovernmental Affairs and the Office of Russia Affairs at the US State Department.\n\nOver the next generation, the NATO alliance should be prudent about both development and change. Historically, the alliance has excelled at being what it formally is: a defensive military alliance. The alliance had been created to deter the Soviet Union, which it did for the duration of the Cold War. Now its task is to deter Russia. Although Russia's invasion of Ukraine has destabilized Russia's relations with the West, NATO territory has not been attacked, and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of NATO member states has not been challenged by Russia. NATO's most important responsibility is to ensure that this remains the case.\n\nNATO's self-definition as a defensive military alliance does not mean it can or should turn inward. Tensions between Russia on the one hand and Europe and the United States on the other are going to remain high for years, if not for decades. Even if NATO is unable to incorporate new states into the alliance -- Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus, or states in the Balkans and in the South Caucasus -- NATO should be conceptualized as the inner circle of a two-layered strategy designed to contain the spread of Russian military power.\n\nNATO should not be directly involved in the war in Ukraine or in subsidiary wars that flow out from Russia's invasion of Ukraine (in Moldova, say, or in Georgia). Yet NATO members should be deeply committed to ensuring Ukraine's security. Were Russia to conquer Ukraine, NATO's deterrent work would be rendered vastly more difficult. Were the Kremlin to see its war in Ukraine as a dead end, Russia would be easier to deter throughout Europe. In this way does Ukraine's security reflect the overall health of the NATO alliance.\n\nNATO runs two separate risks in its possible course of development and change. These risks can be characterized as overreach and underreach.\n\nOverreach would entail the blurring of lines in the existing struggle between NATO and Russia. If the alliance is not disciplined, it could allow several things to happen: direct forms of conflicts between its members and Russia; direct involvement (of the alliance) in the war; and lack of clarity about NATO's mission, which is to say lack of clarity about whether NATO is a defensive military alliance or an alliance geared toward expeditionary ventures.\n\nNATO has been involved in wars previously -- in Afghanistan and in Libya. NATO has never been involved in a war with a nuclear power. NATO's strategic purpose is to avoid war with Russia or to make such war impossible. Overreach leading to unwanted escalation and in effect to a Russia-NATO war would be catastrophic. It could lead to a nuclear exchange, or it could lead to NATO's backing down (to prevent a nuclear exchange) and thus to NATO's undermining of confidence in the integrity and purpose of the alliance itself.\n\nUnderreach would occur were NATO to be unconcerned with the territory outside its formal perimeter. Were NATO to think of itself as \"fortress NATO,\" preoccupied only with the defense of member states, it could find itself in an increasingly precarious position.\n\nWere Ukraine and Moldova to follow the trajectory of Belarus, NATO would face the Russian military across a very long border: Kaliningrad and Belarus in the north; Ukraine and Moldova in the south and on the Black Sea. The Balkans could become a zone of active contestation. This would be a great multiplicity of challenges for NATO, which Russia could exploit to gain advantage, to instill fear in alliance members, and to compel the United States to pull away from Europe and to concentrate on matters closer to home. Over time, underreach could weaken the alliance dramatically.\n\nNATO will succeed in future years if it can find the golden mean. This means not falling into outright war with Russia; this means preserving the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a Ukrainian state and polity; and this means keeping Russia at bay in the many gray areas that surround the NATO alliance. In sum, NATO's challenges in 2024 are greater than they were in 1949, when the alliance was created. Thus, its adaptability and strategic acumen will have to be greater as well.\n\nMichael Kimmage is a Professor of History at the Catholic University of America. From 2014 to 2016, he served on the Secretary's Policy Planning Staff at the U.S. Department of State, where he held the Russia/Ukraine portfolio. His most recent book is Collisions: The War in Ukraine and the Origins of the New Global Instability.\n\nThe best development for NATO that one should wish for, I believe (even if the odds against its happening appear daunting at present), is that it should return to its fundamentals: Prevent war, in accordance to its obligation not just to defend all the signatories of the treaty but also to commit itself, in the words of the treaty, \"not to enter into any international commitments that conflicted with the treaty\" and to adhere \"to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\"\n\nThe U.N. Charter states, as its first objective, \"to maintain international peace and security\" and \"uphold international law.\" In other words, in a more perfect world, NATO should work toward peace and not toward managing conflicts solely through military means in the future.\n\nUnfortunately, how NATO probably will develop and change is a very different matter. In his new strategic concept presented at the Madrid Summit in June 2022, Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg set out five points for the development of NATO. Only one of these, \"taking a global outlook,\" was really \"new.\" This \"global outlook\" involves extending the treaty's mandate exponentially. NATO would develop into a supranational organism with tentacles reaching into many corners of the world, if not all.\n\nOn the other hand, a new generation of populist politicians in the United States and Europe will probably not want to take such a \"global outlook\" but will retreat, if trends are anything to go by, to their own shores in the perhaps-mistaken idea that conflicts here and there will not affect them directly.\n\nHowever, the same conflicts ongoing now might already have escalated to the extent that, even a generation ahead, their consequences will instead produce a general desire to project strength, whatever the human consequences. Thus, European nations will have rearmed and retrained their military and will possibly no longer accept the sole leadership of the U.S. in NATO affairs. It will then take a very astute politician to rein in everyone's power instincts: Failing the presence of such a man or woman, NATO could actually break apart amidst exacerbated rivalries, including economic ones, and conflicting nationalist postures and interests.\n\nAnne Kraatz is a Non-Resident Fellow at the Quincy Institute. She was a Senior Fellow at the Institute for Open Diplomacy in Paris, and a member of the Executive Committee of Democrats Abroad in France, in charge of organizing and moderating public debates on U.S. foreign affairs.\n\nNATO was created in 1949 to protect its members against the Soviet threat. During the Cold War, NATO was also very aware of the risks of escalation, some of which were existential. Accordingly, the main aims were to deter armed conflict and to ensure a reliable defense capability. In addition, the alliance sought very early on to contain the risk of a military conflict breaking out by respecting the Soviet Union's central \"red lines\"; it did not even shy away from dialogue and verifiable agreements with an opponent not considered as trustworthy. This attitude found classic expression in the dual strategy from 1967 (the so-called Harmel Report), which is still valid for NATO today. According to this, on the basis of a guaranteed defense capability, NATO was ready for dialogue and détente with the opposing side.\n\nAfter 1989, the bipolar confrontation only seemed to have disappeared. It has not been possible to integrate Russia into a new European security order. Rather, Putin saw that, in particular from the beginning of the 2000s onward, the policies of the U.S. and NATO had not taken into account Russian superpower interests, and that \"red lines\" had been crossed, especially by promising future NATO membership to Ukraine and Georgia. This was also due to the arrogant \"unipolar\" actions of the U.S. administration under George W. Bush and its insensitive focus on military superiority and expanding its and NATO's sphere of influence.\n\nParticularly due to the Russian aggression against Ukraine and the emergence of a Cold War 2.0, it is now important to heed the lessons of NATO's 75-year history:\n\nRegardless of the outcome of the elections in the U.S., however, the European partners must increase their defense efforts in order to focus more on Europe's own security and to be able to assert themselves in the looming phase of global geopolitical upheaval. If this is not possible within the framework of the E.U., a \"core Europe,\" primarily under the leadership of France and Germany, should proceed in order to achieve strategic autonomy in the military area too. This is, moreover, the only way to limit defense spending. At this crucial juncture, the alliance must pursue with sound judgment a realistic security policy aimed at reestablishing sustainable peace and cooperation in Europe and the world.\n\nRüediger Lüedeking is a former German diplomat who served as Permanent Representative to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and Ambassador to Belgium.\n\nIt is imperative for NATO to become more balanced between America and Europe when it comes to burden-sharing. The European members of NATO should organize themselves in a way that they would be able to conduct military operations in their own neighborhood without the direct support of the Americans. While this does not need to be done by the European Union, the E.U. has a key role to play when it comes to providing joint financing for defense procurement and to help develop a European military-industrial policy. Key European members of NATO that are not members of the E.U. -- including the United Kingdom, Norway, and Turkey -- have a lot to offer to such a European pillar of the alliance, and they should be fully integrated into any European defense architecture.\n\nSuch a \"rebalancing\" of the Atlantic alliance -- with the goal of the European members to spend a roughly equal amount of money on defense and having similar military capabilities -- would guarantee that NATO will endure through the 21 century, as it would no longer be subject to the whims of American domestic politics. After all, an international alliance sharing both common interests and common values is equally valuable for both Americans and Europeans, as it would increase both North America's and Europe's influence in the rest of the world, and benefit its citizens by providing stability and security in which their mixed-market economies can continue to grow and thrive.\n\nIn reality, however, there is a substantial risk that European efforts will fall well short of what is needed to achieve a proper rebalancing of NATO. For political economy reasons, current and future American presidents will continue to encourage European allies to buy weapons and military hardware from the United States, and E.U. internal discord over joint financing and the interests of national defense industries will prevent integration of European military procurement. Aging European societies will only increase their demands for more social welfare at the expense of military spending.\n\nIn this scenario, the United States will continue to exert a disproportionate sway over the alliance, which will maintain the unhappy equilibrium of American dominance and European free-riding within NATO, with those perceptions of each side reinforced across the Atlantic, and increased uncertainty over America's future commitment to the alliance. There may also be pressure to expand NATO beyond the Northern Atlantic space, and invite America's democratic allies in the Pacific, including Japan, South Korea, and Australia, to join. NATO would then serve as the U.S. vehicle to contain not only Russia, but also China. If this development materializes, it has the potential of further increasing geopolitical tension between the West and the rest as well as within NATO.\n\nMatthias Matthijs holds the Dean Acheson Chair at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and is a Senior Fellow for Europe at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nAn armistice agreement in Ukraine -- which now seems likely in the foreseeable future -- should include a commitment by NATO and Russia to set verifiable limitations on conventional deployments on either side of a demilitarized truce line. This could either be considered a revamping and redesign of the Conventional Forces in Europe agreement or could be more circumscribed and less ambitious. In either case, for the U.S. in particular, structuring a durable peace would require reactivating diplomatic capacities sidelined during the zero-sum struggle between Russia and NATO.\n\nThe postwar framework should explicitly allow the European members of NATO to increase national defense outlays to achieve a rough balance of conventional capability vis à vis Russia. This would require U.S. acceptance of a collective E.U. role in defense industrial development. The aim of this Europeanization of NATO would be to render the U.S. conventional military force presence in Europe less essential. The U.S. would still extend its nuclear umbrella over NATO members in Europe, but NATO's European pillar would become more capable and have a greater voice in decision-making. NATO should shift its focus from expansion eastward to supporting Europe's development of its conventional defense capabilities, an enterprise likely to take at least a decade.\n\nNATO would remain the principal framework for mutual defense of the Transatlantic West. Russia and NATO should work to revive stabilizing measures to diminish the risk of renewed conflict in Europe, as in the years following the Cuban missile crisis. The restoration of nuclear arms control agreements should be given priority.\n\nThe hard lessons of the last few years have exposed the failure of military power and even the harshest economic sanctions to resolve interstate conflict without unacceptable risk to the broader security interests of all parties. Diplomatic contacts between Russia and the United States would have to be put on a more sober and patient track.\n\nWithout such agreements, the continuation of the war in Ukraine on its current trajectory carries the danger of escalation to direct confrontation between NATO and Russia. The determination of the U.S. and its partners to project unity and resolve in defense of Ukraine has taken on a life of its own and functions as an instrument within an information war, favoring \"narrative\" over reality. The summit in Washington in July risks being absorbed almost entirely in avoidance of any unwelcome controversy over the question of Ukraine's path to membership and in the frantic attempt to make the prospect of eventual NATO membership credible to Ukraine's leadership. Any open debate and frank reflection around shoring up NATO under a possible Trump presidency and exploring scenarios for the end of the war will, at best, remain behind closed doors.\n\nThe nostalgic reification of NATO has played a big role in producing the dilemma now facing us. The July summit will celebrate the revival of U.S. prestige within NATO, the near-unanimity among European allies in supporting \"victory\" for Ukraine, and the restored relevance of NATO in the face of a renewed military threat from Russia to the alliance. The papering over of challenges to NATO and the failure to design and implement reforms will continue so long as there is no consensus around achievable war aims and no effort to find a negotiated end to the conflict.\n\nDr. Molly O'Neal is a Non-Resident Fellow at the Quincy Institute and a former U.S. Foreign Service Officer dealing with Eastern Europe, Russia, and Eurasia.\n\nAlliances are ultimately arrangements between two or more states for security cooperation and are generally targeted against a particular adversary. NATO played this role during the Cold War, with Western European states, Canada, and the United States balancing potential Soviet ambitions on the Continent. Informed by this logic, many analysts predicted NATO's demise after the Cold War; indeed, the alliance's ability to endure and expand in scope (though not coherence and function) after 1991 at least partly motivates claims that the alliance's shared values and institutional anchoring will allow it to thrive in future.\n\nYet there is a simpler explanation for NATO's post-Cold War endurance that ought to give us pause as to NATO's future health. If alliances form largely in response to threats, it follows that they ought to end not simply when an old threat dies, but when a new threat emerges at the same time. From this perspective, the end of the Cold War saw the Soviet Union die, but because no new threat emerged, NATO could continue unimpeded. NATO became a Swiss Army Knife for spreading liberal values, fighting terrorism, and establishing an array of new goals.\n\nToday, however, the situation is different: Domestic politics aside, we see a growing disconnect between European and American priorities. The United States is increasingly focused on China, so much so that the (overstated) China threat is one of the true points of bipartisan consensus in Washington. European states, on the other hand, are divided between those who see a pronounced threat from Russia and those who see an array of challenges from illegal migration and state instability along the southern maritime border.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, NATO's days may be numbered -- at least in its current form. States with diverging or divergent interests can try to paper over their differences. In a world of finite time and resources, however, differing priorities tend to drive alliances apart, as member states place their bets and act out of self-interest. With NATO, this may not result in an abrupt end to transatlantic cooperation, but it does imply a progressive weakening of the commitment, waning coordination, and a hollowing out of the alliance.\n\nIf and as American and European attentions continue to part, the United States may increasingly pass the security buck to the European members of the alliance. Without the ability to steer European security policy, Washington may well look to reduce its exposure to European contingencies -- just as many in Europe may be increasingly growing reluctant to count on U.S. assistance amid a crisis in which, for self-interested reasons, Washington may be unwilling to help. A result could be a NATO that remains alive on paper but, in practice, is primarily a European show.\n\nThis would not be a bad result for the United States. Indeed, the founders of the alliance actually wanted NATO to be a temporary expedient, a shield behind which Western Europe could recover from the devastation of the Second World War before taking on the hard task of balancing the Soviet Union. That original idea was lost for much of the last seven decades. Yet, as NATO celebrates its 75th birthday, geopolitical developments -- more so than domestic politics -- may bring the founders' vision back to the fore.\n\nJoshua Shifrinson is an Associate Professor in the School of Public Policy of the University of Maryland, and author of Rising Titans, Falling Giants: How Great Powers Exploit Power Shifts (2023).\n\nHow NATO should and will develop over the next generation depends entirely on a guess about what happens geopolitically.\n\nFew alliances last even NATO's 75 years. As an institution, NATO is too weak to perpetuate itself against key members' wishes. The alliance will, as always, be fractious, and it's harder to manage with 32+ nations than with the original 12. The U.S. interest in sustaining NATO is in secular decline. Some have predicted that NATO cannot last without the U.S. And an E.U.-based version of NATO is perfectly conceivable if a President Trump or similar were to pull America out.\n\nSo, seen from the outside, it's reasonable to wonder whether NATO will even exist a generation from now. But, viewed from the inside, NATO has staying power. It exists not just to keep Russia out and America in, but to keep Western and Central Europe from disintegrating again along national lines. Presidents Putin and Trump have massively increased European incentives for hanging together -- preferably with but, if necessary, without America.\n\nMy guess is that a generation from now, NATO will still be in sustained military confrontation with Russia; Washington will still not want Europe -- its largest trading and investment partner -- to fall apart, even if the U.S. becomes a semidetached ally; and an E.U.-based alternative still could not rope in British, Turkish, and Norwegian capabilities as effectively.\n\nIn that anxious security context, NATO should develop a European pillar in tighter collaboration with the E.U., pursuing common European procurement goals and smoothing transatlantic defense industrial frictions through NATO's defense planning process. It should remain open to new members who can increase alliance security, including Ukraine. It should secure the Euro-Atlantic for America, leaving the U.S. and other individual allies to operate in the Indo-Pacific. It should be the arms control organization it claims to be, advancing proposals to Moscow to manage confrontation at lower levels of risk and higher levels of deterrence. It should work to be seen internationally as a valued stability generator in an unstable world, investing heavily in its partnerships for military professionalism under democratic political control.\n\nAnd how will NATO in fact develop? Outlier possibilities exist for more significant damage to its cohesion and effectiveness from America's isolationism and China focus, E.U. ideology and incoherence, British and Turkish E.U. complications, Russian and Chinese erosions, and the continuing lack of a shared vision among allies.\n\nIt will be both less European and less transatlantic than it needs to be, less robust and more threatening toward Moscow than it needs to be, more internally factional than it ought to be, and less confident than it should be about working intimately with the E.U. and U.N. on geographical and functional instabilities. It may have lost Hungary and Bulgaria to Russian influence, and it will have gained Ukraine, formally or otherwise. It will be badly divided over China. Strong anti-Americanism in Europe will complicate public politics, but Europe's structural inefficiencies will mean the U.S. is still the essential partner."

The US goal is to weaken Russia as a military power. US Secretary Austin said, \"We want Ukraine to win. One of our goals has been to limit Russia's ability that's why we are arming the Ukrainians with weapons and equipment to defend themselves from Russian attacks. We are using sanctions and export controls that are directly targeted at Russia's defense industry to undercut Russia's economic and military power to threaten and attack its neighbours.\"\n\nSo, the decision to end this Russia-Ukraine war lies with the West, US-NATO-EU. In this Russia-Ukraine war, Russia is the aggressor but the West US-NATO provoked Putin to the point of no return. This Russia-Ukraine war is the longest and most destructive since World War II creating a global crisis. This US-NATO Proxy War on Russia will continue through Ukraine. The objective of the West has throughout been to prolong the conflict for as long as possible and the same has been reflected in the recent Swiss Peace Initiative (15 and 16 June 2024) without Russian participation. Victory over Russia was a near impossible dream so now prolong the conflict for as long as possible. Everyone preaches that negotiations are the best shot for peace but where are they on ground for the Ukraine-Russia War including the Swiss Peace Initiative? Peace to end the war was nowhere on the agenda!\n\nG7 (Group of Seven: US, Italy, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, and Britain) major powers foreign ministers met on Capri Island, Italy on April 18, 2024, and pledged to bolster Ukraine's air defences and asked China to stop supporting Moscow's military industry if it wanted good relations with the West! The G7 Foreign minister acknowledged they had to do more to help Ukraine, which is struggling to hold off stronger Russian forces. Ukraine President Zelensky said that his country has \"A Chance at Victory\" over Russia with the new armaments package!\n\nThe West and the US has for decades been directly or indirectly involved in wars in other countries' by supporting proxy wars, inciting anti-government insurgencies, providing weapons and ammunition, and training anti-government forces, which have caused serious harm to the stability and security of the world. The West is aware of its initiated wars and expansionist power politics for two centuries.\n\nRecently a senior US politician and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham unabashedly stated in a media interview that Ukraine holds business value for the US. He claimed that there are \"10 to 12 trillion dollars of critical minerals\" in Ukraine, and the primary reason for supporting Ukraine is to seize these critical minerals by defeating Russia on the battlefield. Furthermore, he advocated for seizing and using frozen Russian assets in Europe and the US. (GlobalTimes).\n\nSuch remarks reveal the true intentions behind the US and NATO political elites' current policy toward the Ukraine crisis. \"Now you know why the West won't allow peace talks.\" The rest of the world may be keen to end the War, but the West's, US-NATO is only keen to prolong the conflict for as long as possible to weaken Russia as seen from various meetings over the years and Peace talks with a ceasefire to end the war is nowhere in the horizon. May be the likely leadership changes post elections in the US and France bring this war to an end? Donald Trump has repeatedly said he could settle the war between Russia and Ukraine in one day if he's elected president again. Russia's UN ambassador says he can't.\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who is an outspoken critic of Western military aid to Ukraine urged (02 July) Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to consider a ceasefire to accelerate an end to the war with Russia during his first trip to Kyiv in more than a decade. Orban said \"I asked the president to think about whether we could reverse the order, and speed up peace talks with a ceasefire first,\" Orban said.\n\nThere are no current negotiations between Ukraine and Russia and, based on public statements by Zelensky and Russian President Putin, the two sides appear as far apart as ever when it comes to the terms of a potential peace settlement. Unity between North America and its allies across the Atlantic Ocean is key as Europe faces a full-scale war and tensions rise around the globe, says outgoing NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. He had earlier told the Economist that alliance members should let Ukraine strike deep into Russia with Western weapons, a view supported by some European members of the transatlantic alliance but not the United States.\n\nIt's, therefore, the duty and responsibility of the UN and the West US-NATO to find ways to stop the Ukraine war. Under Article 24 of the UN Charter, the UN Security Council (UNSC) has\"primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.\" However, the UN has repeatedly failed in itsprimary responsibility. All wars end but wonder how will this war end with No Winners?"

But, he added, a proposal to establish a NATO liaison office in Tokyo, intended as a hub for cooperation with Australia, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand, is currently \"not under active discussion.\"\n\nIn celebration of NATO's 75th anniversary, more than two dozen influencers have been invited to observe the proceedings and create social media content to commemorate the milestone.\n\nThe following excerpts from the interview have been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nVOA: Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban visited Kyiv on Tuesday and urged President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to consider a cease-fire with Russia. Are you concerned that this shows a divide in NATO? What is the U.S. perspective on Orban's visit to Ukraine?\n\nDouglas Jones, deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs: It's good that Prime Minister Orban visited Ukraine. On the idea of a cease-fire, these decisions are for Ukraine to make. We've always said, \"Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.\" It is up to Ukraine to decide when it's time to discuss a cease-fire and what the terms of any peace settlement might be.\n\nVOA: Moving on to NATO: What are the key items on the agenda? Are the foreign ministers of Israel and several Arab countries invited to the NATO summit?\n\nJones: We will be talking about the state of NATO. This summit is really about the future, about how NATO continues to transform and adapt itself to meet future challenges.\n\nWhether that's supporting Ukraine in its defense against Russian aggression, working with partners to build the resilience of allies to confront the threats and challenges from the People's Republic of China, or addressing hybrid and cyber threats, these are all issues that we'll be focusing on at the summit.\n\nNATO has a broad network of partnerships. There are 35 countries around the world that have a formal partnership relationship with NATO. They will all be invited at the level of foreign ministers to attend, including Israel and many countries in the Middle East.\n\nVOA: Zelenskyy is expected to attend next week's NATO summit. Does the U.S. view Ukraine's path to NATO membership as irreversible? Are the U.S. and its allies working to incorporate such language into NATO's joint statement?\n\nJones: The United States and all NATO allies have said that Ukraine's future is in NATO. At this summit, we will be rolling out concrete ways in which NATO can help Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression, build the future force needed to deter Russia, and implement the reforms it needs to make itself a stronger candidate for eventual NATO membership.\n\nTogether, this is what we describe as a bridge to NATO membership. The assistance that we're going to be rolling out at the summit will really help accelerate Ukraine on its path to NATO membership.\n\nVOA: And such a bridge is irreversible?\n\nJones: The wording of the declaration is still under negotiation by NATO allies. The alliance has already said that Ukraine will become a member of NATO.\n\nVOA: Regarding NATO's Indo-Pacific strategy, could you give us an update on the plan to open a NATO liaison office in Tokyo?\n\nJones: So, at the summit, the outcome with the Indo-Pacific partners is that all the heads of state and governments of NATO's Indo-Pacific partners -- Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand -- will be present. There are only three main meetings of the summit, and one of them will be when the heads of state of all 32 NATO allies meet with these Indo-Pacific partners. This is going to be the third summit in a row where this has happened.\n\nAnd the reason for that is because allies are increasingly recognizing that there are links between security in the Euro-Atlantic space and in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nUkraine is the No. 1 example where you have the biggest threat to transatlantic security, with Russia being fueled by assistance from China and the DPRK.\n\nVOA: Is there going to be a NATO office in Tokyo, or has such a plan been postponed indefinitely?\n\nJones: It's not under active discussion currently within the alliance.\n\nVOA: What can we expect from the NATO summit regarding the implications of the Russia-North Korea mutual defense pact?\n\nJones: Russia is seeking weapons from the DPRK as it looks for ways to continue its assault and aggression against Ukraine. The connections are deep. That's why we'll have the leaders of NATO's Indo-Pacific partners at the summit: to discuss how we can learn from each other and cooperate in addressing these common security challenges."

        "body_eng": "Source: The Conversation - UK - By Stefan Wolff, Professor of International Security, University of Birmingham\n\nUkraine has firmly ruled out any compromises in its war with Russia, according to a senior aide to President Volodymyr Zelensky. Andriy Yermak, the Ukrainian president's chief of staff, said that while Kyiv welcomed advice on how to reach a \"just peace\", Ukraine is \"not ready to go to the compromise for the very important things and values ... independence, freedom, democracy, territorial integrity, sovereignty\".\n\nYermak's comments came a day after Viktor Orbán, the Hungarian prime minister suggested that Kyiv should agree a ceasefire with Moscow. Orbán, who is known to be close to Vladimir Putin and who has just taken over the rotating presidency of the European Council, raised the idea during his first wartime visit to Kyiv on July 2.\n\nOrbán has been the most sceptical of the EU leaders when it comes to European financial and military support for Ukraine. He was instrumental in delaying the agreement of a €50 billion (£42 billion) aid package for several months earlier this year.\n\nBut, despite Orbán's reticence, the EU recently agreed a bilaterial security pact with Zelensky while he visited Brussels on June 27. Under the terms of the deal, \"the European Union and its\n\nMember States will contribute, for the long term and together with partners, to security commitments to Ukraine, which will help Ukraine to defend itself, resist destabilisation efforts and deter acts of aggression in the future\".\n\nThe EU deal is the latest of 20 such bilateral agreements, including with the US and major European powers. But while they represent a show of support for Ukraine, they fall short of providing actual security guarantees. None of Kyiv's partners are willing to deploy troops for the country's defence, primarily because this is seen as a pathway to escalation into a full-scale confrontation between Russia and Nato.\n\nSo none of these security agreements are therefore likely to deter Putin in his war of aggression. But they are far from ineffective or useless. They provide ten-year commitments to train and equip Ukraine's armed forces, to strengthen the country's defence industrial base and to contribute to its economic recovery.\n\nAt the same time, they reiterate the need for Russian leaders to be held accountable and for sanctions against Moscow to be maintained, and if necessary extended. All of this sends a clear signal that Ukraine's western partners are serious about their support.\n\nBeyond the symbolism of the sheer number of agreements, they have also had positive practical consequences for Ukraine.

Russias' economy remains resilient, Moscow continues to mobilise more troops than Kyiv, and its alliances with Iran, North Korea, and China are giving it valuable economic, military and diplomatic cover.\n\nIt is not clear how long Russia can maintain this position of at least relative strength.

Faced with Russian occupation of Crimea and large chunks of eastern Ukraine - and with lukewarm support from the west - it had to rely on a worthless \"agreement\" with Russia and no assurances against further Russian aggression.\n\nBut this isn't a foregone conclusion, whatever the outcomes of November's presidential election. On the contrary, the multiple security agreements that Ukraine has signed over the past few months also make an alternative future conceivable.\n\nIt's a future in which, with western help, Kyiv can demonstrate the futility of Russian aggression by regaining more territory and provide more effective air defences for its population and infrastructure. Western military aid, and the permission to strike at Russian military bases will help disrupt the supply lines that have enabled Russia's battlefield victories.\n\nIn this case, Putin is unlikely to look like the kind of winner that Trump likes to back. This calculation creates a window of opportunity for Ukraine's western partners over the next six or so months to double down on, and accelerate, their support for Kyiv and future-proof what ultimately might turn out a winning strategy in a war of attrition after all.\n\nStefan Wolff is a past recipient of grant funding from the Natural Environment Research Council of the UK, the United States Institute of Peace, the Economic and Social Research Council of the UK, the British Academy, the NATO Science for Peace Programme, the EU Framework Programmes 6 and 7 and Horizon 2020, as well as the EU's Jean Monnet Programme.

Andriy Yermak, the Ukrainian president's chief of staff, said that while Kyiv welcomed advice on how to reach a \"just peace\", Ukraine is \"not ready to go to the compromise for the very important things and values ... independence, freedom, democracy, territorial integrity, sovereignty\".\n\nYermak's comments came a day after Viktor Orbán, the Hungarian prime minister suggested that Kyiv should agree a ceasefire with Moscow. Orbán, who is known to be close to Vladimir Putin and who has just taken over the rotating presidency of the European Council, raised the idea during his first wartime visit to Kyiv on July 2.\n\nOrbán has been the most sceptical of the EU leaders when it comes to European financial and military support for Ukraine. He was instrumental in delaying the agreement of a €50 billion (£42 billion) aid package for several months earlier this year.\n\nBut, despite Orbán's reticence, the EU recently agreed a bilaterial security pact with Zelensky while he visited Brussels on June 27. Under the terms of the deal, \"the European Union and its Member States will contribute, for the long term and together with partners, to security commitments to Ukraine, which will help Ukraine to defend itself, resist destabilisation efforts and deter acts of aggression in the future\".\n\nThe EU deal is the latest of 20 such bilateral agreements, including with the US and major European powers. But while they represent a show of support for Ukraine, they fall short of providing actual security guarantees. None of Kyiv's partners are willing to deploy troops for the country's defence, primarily because this is seen as a pathway to escalation into a full-scale confrontation between Russia and Nato.\n\nSo none of these security agreements are therefore likely to deter Putin in his war of aggression. But they are far from ineffective or useless. They provide ten-year commitments to train and equip Ukraine's armed forces, to strengthen the country's defence industrial base and to contribute to its economic recovery.\n\nAt the same time, they reiterate the need for Russian leaders to be held accountable and for sanctions against Moscow to be maintained, and if necessary extended. All of this sends a clear signal that Ukraine's western partners are serious about their support.\n\nBeyond the symbolism of the sheer number of agreements, they have also had positive practical consequences for Ukraine.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has promised that Germany will not be a party to the conflict in Ukraine even though Berlin provides military aid to Kiev.\n\n\"Yes, I give this guarantee,\" he said when asked by Bundestag members. \"I do guarantee this as chancellor,\" Scholz added.\n\nGermany is Ukraine's second largest military equipment donor after the United States. Berlin's present and future expenditures are currently estimated at about 28 billion euro. Russia has reiterated that pumping weapons into Ukraine will not weaken Russia's resolve or reverse the progress of its special military operation."
