Prime Minister Viktor Orban urged Ukraine on Tuesday to consider a cease-fire to speed up peace talks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore cracks in the alliance could emerge Sunday with the potential electoral triumph of France's main far-right party. The party, National Rally, has a history of pro-Russia sympathies, and last year abstained in a vote on France's security pact with Ukraine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOutgoing NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg acknowledged the split in opinion on Ukraine in a news conference with Orban in June but expressed optimism in the alliance ultimately standing together in solidarity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"We are 32 allies, and sometimes there are different opinions, but we have proven again and again that we are able to overcome them and find a common way forward,\" he said.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOrban has assured NATO that Hungary will not oppose the expected announcement next week of a new mission in Germany to coordinate aid to Ukraine as well as a long-term financial pledge by the alliance to provide military support. But Orban also made clear that Hungary will not contribute personnel or funds for the efforts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor now, any disagreements among NATO allies concerning Ukraine seem to be superficial cracks in the veneer of the alliance rather than at its foundations, according to Sean Monaghan, a U.K. visiting fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Gaining consensus in the face of differing national positions on critical issues is normal business for NATO, and I would expect any cracks to be patched up by the time we get to Washington next week,\" he said.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe main aim of the summit will be to maintain and show unity, especially as the alliance marks a landmark 75th anniversary while war rages in Europe, and its largest member -- the United States -- moves into a highly consequential presidential election, Monaghan said.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe public is unlikely to see the kind of discord that accompanied last year's summit in Lithuania, when open debate about Ukraine's future with the alliance caused Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to lash out in frustration, he said.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"We won't see any last-minute debates in public this time. We'll see a unified position on Ukraine,\" Monaghan said.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBehind the scenes, countries such as Hungary and Slovakia could cause problems, but the biggest sources of potential obstacles will be the U.S. and Germany, said Luke Coffey, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Hungary and Slovakia are very loud with their rhetoric, but behind closed doors, they tend to be more cooperative and pragmatic. If we wanted to do something with Ukraine inside NATO, and the only voice against it was Hungary's, there are ways to make Hungary come around,\" he said. \"But if Berlin or Washington is against something, they're too big. They're too big to try to influence or persuade.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWashington and Berlin are \"dead set against\" extending an invitation for Ukraine to join NATO, he said. However, support for arming Ukraine to repel Russia's invasion remains strong in NATO and is unlikely to change in the near term.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Is the political will still there to do this? So far, I think the answer is yes,\" Coffey said.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat resolve is expected to continue even as various countries head to the polls. Coffey noted widespread fears in 2022 that the election of far-right leader Giorgia Meloni as Italy's prime minister would spell disaster for Ukraine never came to pass.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Now, Italy is one of the strongest advocates for arming Ukraine,\" he said.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe glue holding the NATO alliance together ultimately goes beyond each member nation's shifting politics, Monaghan said.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"NATO is an alliance of liberal democracies,\" he said. \"The democracies have elections, and the positions of allies change, but I don't think they change so fundamentally to turn cracks into massive fissures. NATO is an alliance that's built on a community of shared values. It always has been, and I think it will continue into the future.\""],["The United States is sending Ukraine a significant new package of weapons and equipment to support the Ukrainian military as it continues to fight against Russian aggression.

Both the Patriot and NASAMS systems have played a crucial role in Ukraine's ability to defend against Russian air attacks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Pentagon also announced a $150 million boost for Ukraine through the Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) package, which allows the DOD to draw directly from the U.S.'s stockpiles. The PDA package will include additional air defense interceptors, artillery and anti-tank weapons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAccording to the DOD's announcement, this is the 60th time that the Biden Administration has drawn from Washington's inventories for Ukraine since August 2021.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Make no mistake, Ukraine is not alone, and the United States will never waver in our support,\" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said during a meeting with Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov at the Pentagon on Tuesday. \"Alongside some 50 allies and partners, we'll continue to provide critical capabilities that Ukraine needs to push back Russian aggression today and to deter Russian aggression tomorrow.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUkraine is currently in possession of at least two Patriot missile defense systems -- one that was donated by the U.S., and another that was provided in partnership between Germany and the Netherlands.

Pedal to the metal, man,\" his colleagues called out over a walkie-talkie as the drone swooped toward him. \"You're screwed, screwed!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf the drone had been armed with explosives, and if his colleagues hadn't disengaged the autonomous tracking, Babenko would have been a goner.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVyriy is just one of many Ukrainian companies working on a major leap forward in the weaponization of consumer technology, driven by the war with Russia. The pressure to outthink the enemy, along with huge flows of investment, donations and government contracts, has turned Ukraine into a Silicon Valley for autonomous drones and other weaponry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat the companies are creating is technology that makes human judgment about targeting and firing increasingly tangential. The widespread availability of off-the-shelf devices, easy-to-design software, powerful automation algorithms and specialized artificial intelligence microchips has pushed a deadly innovation race into uncharted territory, fueling a potential new era of killer robots.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe most advanced versions of the technology that allows drones and other machines to act autonomously have been made possible by deep learning, a form of AI that uses large amounts of data to identify patterns and make decisions. Deep learning has helped generate popular large language models, like OpenAI's GPT-4, but it also helps make models interpret and respond in real time to video and camera footage. That means software that once helped a drone follow a snowboarder down a mountain can now become a deadly tool.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn more than a dozen interviews with Ukrainian entrepreneurs, engineers and military units, a picture emerged of a near future when swarms of self-guided drones can coordinate attacks and machine guns with computer vision can automatically shoot down soldiers. More outlandish creations, like a hovering unmanned copter that wields machine guns, are also being developed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe weapons are cruder than the slick stuff of science-fiction blockbusters, like \"The Terminator\" and its T-1000 liquid-metal assassin, but they are a step toward such a future. While these weapons aren't as advanced as expensive military-grade systems made by the United States, China and Russia, what makes the developments significant is their low cost -- just thousands of dollars or less -- and ready availability.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eExcept for the munitions, many of these weapons are built with code found online and components such as hobbyist computers, like Raspberry Pi, that can be bought from Best Buy and a hardware store. Some U.S. officials said they worried that the abilities could soon be used to carry out terrorist attacks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor Ukraine, the technologies could provide an edge against Russia, which is also developing autonomous killer gadgets -- or simply help it keep pace. The systems raise the stakes in an international debate about the ethical and legal ramifications of AI on the battlefield. Human rights groups and United Nations officials want to limit the use of autonomous weapons for fear that they may trigger a new global arms race that could spiral out of control.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn Ukraine, such concerns are secondary to fighting off an invader.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"We need maximum automation,\" said Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine's minister of digital transformation, who has led the country's efforts to use tech startups to expand advanced fighting capabilities. \"These technologies are fundamental to our victory.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAutonomous drones like Vyriy's have already been used in combat to hit Russian targets, according to Ukrainian officials and video verified by The New York Times. Fedorov said the government was working to fund drone companies to help them rapidly scale up production.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMajor questions loom about what level of automation is acceptable. For now, the drones require a pilot to lock onto a target, keeping a \"human in the loop\" -- a phrase often invoked by policymakers and AI ethicists. Ukrainian soldiers have raised concerns about the potential for malfunctioning autonomous drones to hit their own forces. In the future, constraints on such weapons may not exist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUkraine has \"made the logic brutally clear of why autonomous weapons have advantages,\" said Stuart Russell, an AI scientist and professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who has warned about the dangers of weaponized AI. \"There will be weapons of mass destruction that are cheap, scalable and easily available in arms markets all over the world.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn a ramshackle workshop in an apartment building in eastern Ukraine, Dev, a 28-year-old soldier in the 92nd Assault Brigade, has helped push innovations that turned cheap drones into weapons. First, he strapped bombs to racing drones, then added larger batteries to help them fly farther and recently incorporated night vision so the machines can hunt in the dark.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn May, he was one of the first to use autonomous drones, including those from Vyriy. While some required improvements, Dev said, he believed that they would be the next big technological jump to hit the front lines.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAutonomous drones are \"already in high demand,\" he said. The machines have been especially helpful against jamming that can break communications links between drone and pilot. With the drone flying itself, a pilot can simply lock onto a target and let the device do the rest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMakeshift factories and labs have sprung up across Ukraine to build remote-controlled machines of all sizes, from long-range aircraft and attack boats to cheap kamikaze drones -- abbreviated as FPVs, for first-person view, because they are guided by a pilot wearing virtual-reality-like goggles that give a view from the drone. Many are precursors to machines that will eventually act on their own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEfforts to automate FPV flights began last year, but were slowed by setbacks building flight control software, according to Fedorov, who said those problems had been resolved. The next step was to scale the technology with more government spending, he said, adding that about 10 companies were already making autonomous drones.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"We already have systems which can be mass-produced, and they're now extensively tested on the front lines, which means they're already actively used,\" Fedorov said.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome companies, like Vyriy, use basic computer vision algorithms, which analyze and interpret images and help a computer make decisions. Other companies are more sophisticated, using deep learning to build software that can identify and attack targets. Many of the companies said they pulled data and videos from flight simulators and front-line drone flights.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne Ukrainian drone maker, Saker, built an autonomous targeting system with AI processes originally designed for sorting and classifying fruit. During the winter, the company began sending its technology to the front lines, testing different systems with drone pilots. Demand soared.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy May, Saker was mass-producing single-circuit-board computers loaded with its software that could be easily attached to FPV drones so the machines could auto-lock onto a target, said the company's CEO, who asked to be referred to only by his first name, Viktor, for fear of retaliation by Russia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe drone then crashes into its target \"and that's it,\" he said. \"It resists wind. It resists jamming. You just have to be precise with what you're going to hit.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSaker now makes 1,000 of the circuit boards a month and plans to expand to 9,000 a month by the end of the summer. Several of Ukraine's military units have already hit Russian targets on the front lines with Saker's technology, according to the company and videos confirmed by the Times.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn one clip of Saker technology shared on social media, a drone flies over a field scarred by shelling. A box at the center of the pilot's viewfinder suddenly zooms in on a tank, indicating a lock. The drone attacks on its own, exploding into the side of the armor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSaker has gone further in recent weeks, successfully using a reconnaissance drone that identified targets with AI and then dispatched autonomous kamikaze drones for the kill, Viktor said. In one case, the system struck a target 25 miles away.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Once we reach the point when we don't have enough people, the only solution is to substitute them with robots,\" said Rostyslav, a Saker co-founder who also asked to be referred to only by his first name.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn a hot afternoon last month in the eastern Ukrainian region known as the Donbas, Yurii Klontsak, a 23-year-old reservist, trained four soldiers to use the latest futuristic weapon: a gun turret with autonomous targeting that works with a PlayStation controller and a tablet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpeaking over booms of nearby shelling, Klontsak explained how the gun, called Wolly after a resemblance to the Pixar robot WALL-E, can auto-lock on a target up to 1000 meters away and jump between preprogrammed positions to quickly cover a broad area. The company making the weapon, DevDroid, was also developing an auto-aim to track and hit moving targets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"When I first saw the gun, I was fascinated,\" Klontsak said. \"I understood this was the only way, if not to win this war, then to at least hold our positions.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe gun is one of several that have emerged on the front lines using AI-trained software to automatically track and shoot targets. Not dissimilar to the object identification featured in surveillance cameras, software on a screen surrounds humans and other would-be targets with a digital box. All that's left for the shooter to do is remotely pull the trigger with a video game controller.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor now, the gunmakers say they do not allow the machine gun to fire without a human pressing a button. But they also said it would be easy to make one that could.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of Ukraine's innovations are being developed to counter Russia's advancing weaponry. Ukrainian soldiers operating machine guns are a prime target for Russian drone attacks. With robot weapons, no human dies when a machine gun is hit. New algorithms, still under development, could eventually help the guns shoot Russian drones out of the sky.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSuch technologies, and the ability to quickly build and test them on the front lines, have gained attention and investment from overseas. Last year, Eric Schmidt, a former Google CEO, and other investors set up a firm called D3 to invest in emerging battlefield technologies in Ukraine. Other defense companies, such as Helsing, are also teaming up with Ukrainian firms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUkrainian companies are moving more quickly than competitors overseas, said Eveline Buchatskiy, a managing partner at D3, adding that the firm asks the companies it invests in outside Ukraine to visit the country so they can speed up their development.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"There's just a different set of incentives here,\" she said.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOften, battlefield demands pull together engineers and soldiers. Oleksandr Yabchanka, a commander in Da Vinci Wolves, a battalion known for its innovation in weaponry, recalled how the need to defend the \"road of life\" -- a route used to supply troops fighting Russians along the eastern front line in Bakhmut -- had spurred invention. Imagining a solution, he posted an open request on Facebook for a computerized, remote-controlled machine gun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn several months, Yabchanka had a working prototype from a firm called Roboneers. The gun was almost instantly helpful for his unit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"We could sit in the trench drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes and shoot at the Russians,\" he said.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYabchanka's input later helped Roboneers develop a new sort of weapon. The company mounted the machine gun turret atop a rolling ground drone to help troops make assaults or quickly change positions. The application has led to a bigger need for AI-powered auto-aim, Roboneers CEO Anton Skrypnyk said.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSimilar partnerships have pushed other advances. On a drone range in May, Swarmer, another local company, held a video call with a military unit to walk soldiers through updates to its software, which enables drones to carry out swarming attacks without a pilot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe software from Swarmer, which was formed last year by a former Amazon engineer, Serhii Kupriienko, was built on an AI model that was trained with large amounts of data on front-line drone missions. It enables a single technician to operate up to seven drones on bombing and reconnaissance missions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently, Swarmer added abilities that can guide kamikaze attack drones up to 35 miles. The hope is that the software, which has been in tests since January, will cut down on the number of people required to operate the miniaturized air forces that dominate the front lines.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring a demonstration, a Swarmer engineer at a computer watched a map as six autonomous drones buzzed overhead. One after the other, large bomber drones flew over a would-be target and dropped water bottles in place of bombs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome drone pilots are afraid they will be replaced entirely by the technology, Kupriienko said.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"They say: 'Oh, it flies without us. They will take away our remote controls and put a weapon in our hand,'\" he said, referring to the belief that it's safer to fly a drone than occupy a trench on the front.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"But I say, no, you'll now be able to fly with five or 10 drones at the same time,\" he said. \"The software will help them fight better.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2017, Russell, the Berkeley AI researcher, released an online film, \"Slaughterbots,\" warning of the dangers of autonomous weapons. In the movie, roving packs of low-cost armed AI drones use facial recognition technology to hunt down and kill targets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat's happening in Ukraine moves us toward that dystopian future, Russell said. He is already haunted, he said, by Ukrainian videos of soldiers who are being pursued by weaponized drones piloted by humans. There's often a point when soldiers stop trying to escape or hide because they realize they cannot get away from the drone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"There's nowhere for them to go, so they just wait around to die,\" Russell said.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe isn't alone in fearing that Ukraine is a turning point. In Vienna, members of a panel of U.N. experts also said they worried about the ramifications of the new techniques being developed in Ukraine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOfficials have spent more than a decade debating rules about the use of autonomous weapons, but few expect any international deal to set new regulations, especially as the United States, China, Israel, Russia and others race to develop even more advanced weapons.

Meanwhile, the G7 countries have frozen $300 billion of Russian assets in their banks but cannot make the jump to seize them to help Ukraine's fight.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy the holdup? Euromaidan Press explains in collaboration with the International Center for Ukrainian Victory.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot fully. First, we cannot fully calculate the extent of damage; second, human lives are priceless. After Ukraine's victory, much will remain to be done to bring Russia to justice. But right now, the G7 have frozen Russian assets in their countries, which can be fully used. However, even now, they are already less than the damages suffered by Ukraine, and the size of the damages is still growing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe biggest slice of the pie is Russian state assets (reserves of the Russian Central Bank, Russia's central financial institution) - $300 billion. They've been frozen in banking institutions across the G7 countries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why are these assets parked there in the first place?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, at the time of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia kept some assets in money and securities abroad in reliable banks, scooping up foreign currency.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe know for a fact that the lion's share of these assets, \u20ac192 billion to be precise, is held in Euroclear, a financial institution headquartered in Brussels that specializes in the safekeeping and settlement of securities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for the rest of the assets, their exact size and location are a bit of a mystery since that information is classified, but it's a safe bet that a hefty chunk is in the USA.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are also Russian private assets floating around abroad, like yachts and businesses belonging to Russian oligarchs and propagandists.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the total value of these is way smaller than the $300 billion in state assets, and confiscating them is a whole other can of worms. Each country has to make its own call on the matter, and then there's a court procedure to go through for each individual case, which is going to take a while.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is also very difficult because the human rights of Russians owning them should be complied with, and the highest legal standards should be applied. That's why the spotlight is on the state assets, given Ukraine's urgent military and reconstruction needs. Confiscating these will be a quicker process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis step falls under the category of countermeasures against an aggressor state that has launched an aggressive war and is violating international law left and right. Western countries have already frozen these funds based on this logic, but they haven't quite mustered up the resolve to fully confiscate them and hand them over to Ukraine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere have been plenty of times throughout history when states have frozen the assets of other countries as a response to aggression:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut actually confiscating those assets and transferring them to the victim country? That's a lot rarer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHistorically, this has always been part of a post-war settlement, like the Treaty of Versailles after World War I or Germany's and Japan's World War II reparations. Directly confiscating frozen assets and handing them over to the victim country while the conflict is still ongoing? That's uncharted territory.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf the proposed use of frozen Russian assets for Ukraine's reconstruction actually happens, it would be a pretty big deal in this regard, but there are solid grounds for it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRussia stands accused of committing genocide in Ukraine and has caused mind-boggling damage to its infrastructure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reconstruction bill already stands at a whopping $486 billion, according to the World Bank. The damage to Ukraine's power grid is especially severe, with Russian strikes destroying 70% of its generating capacity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUkraine does not insist that this money is simply given to Ukraine; rather, the plan is to make the funds work for Ukraine's defense, which is the top priority. There are a few ways this could play out:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUkraine is pushing for the ability to buy domestically-produced weapons with these funds, which are less expensive than western-made ones. They're also beefing up their capacity to handle the funds by ramping up anti-corruption measures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeyond defense, the Russian funds are likely to be used for reconstruction and compensation for victims, although the exact breakdown isn't clear yet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne big step forward to the confiscation of these funds was the US passing the REPO (Russian Elites, Proxies, and Oligarchs) Act on 23 April 2024.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile successfully implementing it depends on further actions and certifications, the REPO Act lays out a legal mechanism for asset confiscation, gives the President the power to start the confiscation process, and allows for coordination with G7 countries, the EU, and other partners. It could potentially give Ukraine access to an estimated $5-8 billion in Russian sovereign assets located in the US.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, the G7 did not follow the US's lead.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstead, on 3 May 2024, the Financial Times reported that the G7 was no longer considering a full confiscation of frozen Russian assets, with an official saying that these assets could be used as leverage in potential peace negotiations with Russia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis stance fails to recognize Russia's true objectives and the pointlessness of using these assets as a bargaining chip, given Russia's continued escalation of aggression and substantial revenues from fossil fuel exports.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeveral initial steps have been taken to ensure that Russia's frozen funds are already benefiting Ukraine:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis loan would allow Ukraine to survive. However, it would not ensure that Russia is punished for its crimes against mankind, ensure Ukraine's victory, or compensate Ukraine for the massive damages Russia caused.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile Ukraine is set to receive portions of the frozen Russian assets, the entire $300 billion would be a game-changer. To put this sum into perspective:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis funding would allow the West to shift from \"drip-feeding\" weapons to a more impactful \"shock and awe\" support strategy. It would ensure a stable supply of ammunition and weapons, addressing the kind of shortages that led to Russian gains in spring 2024 when US aid was delayed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEconomist Timothy Ash argues that for Ukraine to pose a serious challenge to Russia, Western aid needs to increase from $100 billion to $150 billion annually. He suggests that using the confiscated assets is:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn essence, this massive injection of funds could provide Ukraine with critical resources while easing the financial burden on Western taxpayers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat could Ukraine do with $300 billion in Russian assets?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo put this sum into perspective, let's look at the numbers:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInterestingly, with these resources, Ukraine has managed to destroy Russian equipment worth an estimated $98.7 billion - nearly double the value of their own arsenal (check out how we made these estimates here).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf Ukraine were to receive the full $300 billion, it could potentially increase its military capacity by almost six times. Of course, this is a simplification, as factors like equipment availability also play a role.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, what could Ukraine actually buy with this money? According to defense expert Ivan Kyrychevskyi, here's a potential shopping list:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKyrychevskyi estimates this funding could provide Ukraine with a 5-year security cushion. However, he cautions that even with money available, acquiring weapons isn't always straightforward due to availability issues and rising prices.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRussia has already been forcing sales of Western assets at knock-off prices, as well as imposing punitive taxes on Western enterprises for a while now, way before any talk of confiscating Russian assets started:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReports show that Russia had also basically stolen assets from a bunch of other Western companies by handing them over to state-owned enterprises or Putin's buddies' businesses for super cheap:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRussia did all this in violation of international investment law, so Western companies have every right to hit back. Plus, the longer Western companies stay in Russia, the more likely it is that their assets will get snatched up or sold for peanuts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo playing nice with Russia on this issue probably won't do much to protect Western investments anyway.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRussia will definitely try to challenge the confiscation of its assets in court, because it can. It will likely file lawsuits in various courts like the EU Court of Justice, the European Court of Human Rights, the International Court of Justice, and international investment arbitration tribunals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut here's the thing - Russia's chances of actually winning these cases are really low.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the end of the day, if asset confiscation measures are well-designed and clearly based on Russia's well-documented violations of fundamental international laws and norms, they will have a strong legal foundation to withstand Russia's legal challenges. Careful legal framing can make the measures even more bulletproof.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo while Russia will certainly use whatever legal options it has to fight back, its own blatant disregard for international law leaves it without a strong legal case.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe only courts where Russia is likely to win are Russian ones, and then the decision will apply to the territory of Russia. So, theoretically, Western companies that are still doing business in Russia can be affected, but as we've already seen, Putin's regime can confiscate their assets without any legal pretexts anyway, so it would be wiser for them to simply get out of Russia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome worry that confiscating Russian assets might hurt the EU's economy. They think the euro could lose value if people start pulling their money out of banks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere's a fear that other countries might get spooked, thinking their money isn't safe in EU banks anymore. This could cause financial trouble in the Eurozone. Big players like China, Saudi Arabia, and Indonesia have been lobbying against asset confiscation, worried about what it might mean for their own money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut these fears might be blown out of proportion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere's the thing: Russian assets are only on the chopping block because Russia invaded Ukraine. If you're not planning to invade anyone, you've got nothing to worry about. And if you are, perhaps you'll get second thoughts. Two birds with one stone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome are particularly worried about China pulling its investments from Euroclear. But so far, China hasn't made any threats or official statements about doing this. And they haven't done anything like this in the past either.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEconomist Timothy Ash points out that when the West froze Russian money two years ago, emerging economies did not react in any way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe also says that even if countries like Saudi Arabia and China wanted to move their money elsewhere, there's really nowhere else to go. Western banks are still the safest and most reliable places to keep large amounts of money. The euro is still a superstar currency, used in countries with detailed banking laws and high standards to protect people's money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAsh adds that if a country did try to move its money, it would probably end up hurting itself more than anyone else. They could face sanctions from Western countries, see less economic growth, have less trade and investment, and even see oil and commodity prices drop. Countries like Saudi Arabia and China care a lot about keeping their economies stable, so they're unlikely to risk all that just to back up Russia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, while some people are worried, it's pretty unlikely that taking Russian assets would cause other countries to pull their money out of Western banks en masse. The potential downsides for countries trying to move their money, plus the lack of good alternatives to Western banks, make this scenario highly improbable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt its core, the issue of confiscation comes down to political will.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDespite the various reasons that are raised in discussions about confiscating Russian assets, the true answer is that Western countries still aren't fully convinced of Ukraine's eventual victory. As a result, they lack a clear strategy for ensuring Ukraine's success and Russia's defeat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey want to maintain a window for future negotiations with Russia.

This attitude doesn't recognize the true nature of Russian aggression and the Kremlin's ultimate goal of replacing the rules-based order with a \"might makes right\" approach.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately, the West's hesitation to confiscate Russian assets comes from not being fully convinced that Ukraine will win in the end and not having a clear plan for making sure Ukraine succeeds and Russia loses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome Western countries are still hoping to keep the door open for future negotiations with Russia, worried that taking their assets will be seen as a major escalation. They're also worried about losing out on future business opportunities, holding onto the hope that the familiar world where Russia was a business buddy will eventually come back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut Russia's actions over the past two years have made it clear that it has no plans to return to the rules-based international order.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt's time for bold moves, and the G7 needs to find the courage to follow the US's lead in confiscating Russian assets.

This evolution, epitomized by the emergence of advanced infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) and the so-called \"turtle tanks,\" reveals a broader strategic shift and underscores Russia's commitment to maintaining its military edge in an increasingly drone-dominated battlefield.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe war in Ukraine has entered a potentially perilous phase as Russia deploys a new generation of IFVs to the front lines. The BMP-3 and BMD-4M are not mere troop carriers; they represent the pinnacle of modern military engineering, bristling with firepower, agility, and robust armor designed to shield soldiers on the battlefield. Their introduction signals a profound shift in Russia's military strategy, raising concerns of further escalation in an already devastating conflict.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn tandem with this deployment, there has been a notable 20% increase in BMP-3 production by Kurganmashzavod, a powerhouse in Russia's defense industry. This translates to Russian forces receiving 50% more of these vehicles in 2024 compared to the previous year, highlighting the resilience of Russia's domestic military production despite severe international sanctions. The question arises: what capabilities do these new IFVs bring to the fight, and what are the potential consequences of their deployment on the battlefield?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe BMP-3 and BMD-4M are the backbone of Russia's mechanized infantry. To grasp their significance, one must understand the Soviet military doctrine that shaped their development. Post-World War II, the Soviet Red Army emphasized heavily armored formations capable of breaching enemy lines. This philosophy extended to their infantry fighting vehicles. The BMP-1, for example, was armed but vulnerable, sitting tall and unable to swim, making it an easy target.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe BMP-3, introduced in the 1980s, addressed these shortcomings with a design capable of conquering both water and mountainous terrain. It boasts a formidable 100mm main gun capable of firing high-explosive shells and anti-tank missiles, making it versatile enough to handle enemy troops, fortified positions, and tanks. Additionally, a 30mm autocannon and a coaxial 7.62mm machine gun provide a barrage of firepower against lighter targets and helicopters. The BMP-3's adaptability extends to its mobility with water jets for amphibious operations and a sophisticated suspension system for navigating rough terrain.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe BMD-4M, in contrast, traces its lineage to the Cold War's emphasis on airborne assaults. Designed to be lightweight and maneuverable, it can be parachuted into combat zones and dominate the battlefield once deployed. The BMD-4M retains the BMP-3's powerful armament but is enhanced with improved fire control systems for greater precision. It also features anti-tank guided missiles, offering substantial armor-piercing capabilities. Its lightweight design includes an NBC (nuclear, biological, chemical) protection system, safeguarding the crew from various threats.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDespite their advanced design, the brutal realities of the Ukrainian conflict have tested these vehicles under harsh conditions. They have proven vulnerable to sophisticated anti-tank weapons and drone tactics employed by Ukrainian forces. In response, Russia's Kurganmashzavod is rapidly deploying upgraded versions of these IFVs to the front lines. Recent modifications include bar armor on the sides and cage structures over the turrets to deflect RPGs and drone-mounted explosives, enhancing their survivability.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese upgrades are complemented by the Nakidka thermal camouflage system, which reduces the vehicle's thermal signature, making it harder for enemy forces to detect. Additionally, the RP-377VM1L jamming system disrupts the communication between drones and their operators, potentially neutralizing drone threats. While these enhancements represent significant advancements, their real-world effectiveness remains to be fully tested.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn a fascinating adaptation to modern warfare, Russian forces have also introduced \"turtle tanks\" -- a peculiar yet effective response to the increasing threat posed by Ukrainian FPV drones. Initially, these tanks were local improvisations characterized by makeshift counter-FPV drone shelters fabricated from available materials. Early iterations featured simple metal sheets hastily affixed to the tanks, creating an armored shell designed to protect against drone attacks. Despite their rudimentary appearance, these modifications have proven remarkably effective in the field.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFootage from late April captured a Russian armored assault near Krashna Harfa, showcasing a column of infantry fighting vehicles equipped with these counter-FPV shelters. The lead tank, protected by a cope cage, spearheaded the assault, effectively clearing mines with its plow before retreating to safety. This tactic underscores the tanks' dual role: mine clearance and providing cover for advancing units.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy early May, the design of turtle tanks had further evolved. Images from UAVs revealed T-62 tanks with hybrid shelters, combining chain link, grating, and reactive armor. These modifications illustrate a blurring of the lines between traditional cope cages and the new turtle shells. The incorporation of electronic warfare (EW) modules and mine plows underscores a comprehensive approach to battlefield threats.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDespite these innovations, the turtle tanks are not invulnerable. Videos from May showed several instances of these tanks being damaged or destroyed by mines and FPV drone attacks. One particularly striking example involved a turtle tank immobilized by a mine, subsequently attacked by multiple FPV drones. This highlights a significant vulnerability: while the shells offer protection, they are not foolproof against concentrated attacks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe proliferation of turtle tanks across various Russian units, including the 40th Naval Infantry Brigade, indicates a decentralized yet widespread adoption of this concept. This suggests that the Russian military recognizes the value of these modifications and is willing to experiment with different designs to enhance their effectiveness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, the reliance on makeshift solutions also points to a potential weakness: the lack of a unified, centrally coordinated approach to countering drone threats. As the conflict continues, it is likely that both Russian and Ukrainian forces will continue to adapt their tactics, leading to an ongoing cycle of measure and countermeasure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe introduction of these upgraded IFVs represents a double-edged sword. The additional armor and jamming systems provide critical defense against drone strikes and RPG attacks. However, their impact on the war's trajectory is uncertain. Ukrainian forces are likely to adapt their tactics, and these upgrades will not transform these IFVs into invincible war machines. Nonetheless, the improvements may offer enhanced protection for Russian troops, potentially reducing casualties and enabling more aggressive maneuvers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the evolving theater of modern warfare, the significance of drones has grown exponentially, transforming battle strategies and posing unprecedented challenges to traditional armored vehicles. Recognizing this paradigm shift, Russia has embarked on an ambitious project to revolutionize its military hardware, particularly its iconic T-90 series tanks, to counter the ever-increasing threat of drone warfare.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe T-90 series, a cornerstone of Russian military might, has undergone significant transformations to maintain its dominance on the battlefield. The latest iteration, the T-90M \"Proryv-3,\" showcases remarkable advancements in armor, firepower, and electronic warfare capabilities. This state-of-the-art tank is designed to adapt to the rapidly changing dynamics of modern conflict, where drones play a pivotal role in reconnaissance, surveillance, and offensive operations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePresident Vladimir Putin himself has lauded the T-90M as the world's premier battle tank, a sentiment echoed by Russian state media following its deployment in Ukraine in late December 2022. This deployment marked a critical moment in Russia's military strategy, as the T-90M began to engage in active combat against sophisticated adversaries equipped with advanced anti-tank systems and precision-guided munitions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA recent photo circulating on Russian social media has captured the attention of military analysts worldwide. It depicts a T-90M tank fitted with a new anti-drone armor system, a significant departure from the previously seen \"cope cages\" on the tank's turret. This upgrade features symmetrical armor plates on either side of the turret, a design aimed at enhancing the tank's resilience against drone strikes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese modifications are not merely cosmetic; they represent a meticulously engineered response to the growing prevalence of FPV (First-Person View) drones. The new armor plates, positioned approximately 20 inches above the main armor, provide a robust shield against aerial attacks targeting the tank's turret. Additionally, the installation of a jammer on the turret's rear, protected by another armor plate, further strengthens the tank's defenses against drone-delivered ordnance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe enhanced armor of the T-90M is a testament to Russia's commitment to staying ahead in the drone warfare game. These upgrades are tailored to mitigate the specific threats posed by drones, which have become a persistent challenge on the modern battlefield. However, the threat landscape is multifaceted. While these enhancements improve the tank's survivability against drones, they do not fully eliminate the risks posed by advanced anti-tank weapons such as the FGM-148 Javelin or the Bonus and SMArt 155 submunitions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe strategic importance of these upgrades cannot be overstated. By bolstering the T-90M's armor and integrating advanced electronic countermeasures, Russia aims to enhance the tank's operational effectiveness and longevity in combat. The new design also ensures comprehensive protection for critical components such as the engine and transmission, further safeguarding the tank's mobility and functionality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDespite these advancements, the real-world efficacy of these upgrades remains to be thoroughly tested in active combat scenarios. The success of the T-90M's new armor system will depend on its ability to withstand the multifaceted threats it faces, from drone strikes to advanced anti-tank missiles. Military analysts speculate that these modifications represent the initial phase of a broader strategy to modernize Russia's armored fleet, with the potential for similar enhancements to be applied to other tanks, such as the T-72B3, in the near future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe transformation of Russian armored tactics in the Ukraine war, exemplified by the development and deployment of turtle tanks and advanced IFVs, reflects a broader trend towards improvisation and rapid adaptation on the modern battlefield. These innovations, while effective to a degree, also expose new vulnerabilities and challenges. As both sides continue to evolve their strategies, the lessons learned from these adaptations will likely influence armored warfare tactics for years to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe BMP-3 and BMD-4M's upgrades are a clear indication that Russia is acutely aware of the changing dynamics of warfare and is taking proactive steps to ensure its armored vehicles remain formidable adversaries in the face of new and emerging threats. As the conflict in Ukraine continues to evolve, the effectiveness and impact of these formidable machines will undoubtedly play a crucial role in shaping its outcome.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e[Representational image, by Vitaly V.

What to expect from Russia. How to position NATO for the next 75 years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe's a policy researcher at RAND and a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. For more than two decades, she has studied the political, military, and economic drivers that underpin global security. She served as a senior adviser to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs on both Russia and Ukraine, as well as on NATO relations with Ukraine and Georgia. She also joined the U.S. Army in 2015 and now serves as an engineer captain in the Reserves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you look at the battlefield, there's an artificial inflection point that's been brought about by the long delay in approving more U.S. aid to Ukraine. The Russians are going on the offensive. But if the Ukrainians are able to fend them off through the rest of 2024, then I think systemic factors are going to turn in Ukraine's favor. Russia will face increasing difficulties in its defense production, especially its production of armored vehicles. You'll see increasing U.S. and European production coming online. You'll see the introduction of F-16s, which will at least give Ukraine some additional flexibility. Ukraine's strategy through 2024 is going to be to play defense, and hopefully that puts them on a footing for a possible offensive in 2025.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are people in Washington who say we can't keep supporting Ukraine because it undermines our ability to prepare for China. But if we're looking at a potential future conflict with China, there are two worlds we could fight it in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne is a world in which Ukraine loses. In that world, all of our European allies are going to be laser-focused on protecting themselves from the next attack from Russia. The United States will be more diplomatically isolated, because those 31 NATO allies are going to be much more concerned about their own security than about helping the United States in a fight against China.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe other world is one in which Ukraine wins. Then you have a Ukraine that is going to be the largest and most capable army in Europe acting as a bulwark against Russian aggression. That gives you a strong European flank to the United States' east. You have countries that are confident not only in their own security but in the collective capability of NATO to deter and defeat aggression. They are going to be more willing to contribute if the U.S. finds itself in a war in the Indo-Pacific. This idea that somehow helping Ukraine leaves us less prepared for a war in China is just seeing the world as flat when it's not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt needs to either bring them in or make it clear they're not going to be a member. Leaving them in diplomatic limbo just makes things worse for Ukraine and undermines NATO. Personally, I think Ukraine must become a member, but a bigger question right now is, What does NATO need to do to ensure Ukraine wins this war?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA victorious, unified Ukraine would be the most capable military in Europe, and at that point it would just be foolish not to bring them in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIncrease its defense industrial base. As long as Russia sees that it's outproducing the combined capabilities of the United States and its European allies in NATO, it will see that it can continue to fight this war. As soon as the United States and Europe match those numbers, the calculus changes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI'd also like to see NATO air defenses providing a shield over western Ukraine. You've seen Russia fire missiles and attack drones that actually overfly NATO territory. And rather than air defenses from those nations firing at them and shooting them down, they've relied on Ukraine to use its air defenses to do that. The idea that you wouldn't protect NATO skies by engaging those missiles and drones -- it's not only not helping Ukraine, but it's undermining NATO's Article 5 deterrence. I'd also support France's proposal to start bringing troops into western Ukraine, far from the front lines, to provide training on the ground to Ukrainians.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe same way they've responded so far, which is with a lot of nuclear bluster. They know as soon as they mention tactical nuclear weapons, it will freeze decisionmakers in some capitals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe're seeing an increase in threats below the level of military action -- massive amounts of disinformation, illicit finances being used to undermine political processes. NATO has been so successful over the past 75 years that its enemies are trying to use other ways to attack or undermine the alliance. It's going to struggle to define what constitutes an attack, and then to ensure it has the capabilities it needs to respond. You've seen China and Russia engage in these threats below the level of what you would consider conventional military actions. NATO needs to make itself a harder target by developing more capabilities that are below the threshold of direct military confrontation and demonstrating a willingness to use them. But it needs to do that while also upholding the democratic ideas of freedom and openness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI had considered joining at several points in my life. Then, in 2015, I was the senior adviser on Russia strategy, and I'd participate in these wargames, where Russia was attacking NATO. I was always advocating for more NATO forces forward and, in particular, more U.S. forces. We also consistently found that the U.S. Army had not nearly enough large-scale engineering capabilities. My mom used to always say, 'If you want something done right, then do it yourself.' I decided to join as an Army engineer, not just because I thought it was important for me personally. I was advocating moving forward U.S. military forces, essentially as a tripwire, and I wasn't comfortable doing that if I wasn't willing to put myself in that position.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne thing the Army has taught me is how the military approaches risk. It doesn't get to decide which missions to pursue. It just has to look at how to assess and mitigate risk, with the understanding that it will always have to accept a certain level of risk to complete the mission. That's something military leaders understand very well, but it's not necessarily deeply engrained in civilian culture. It's also helped me think more broadly about defense and security problems -- not just looking at things and platforms, but at people and leadership.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was a big Detroit Red Wings fan when I was a kid. Hockey fans might remember, back in the '90s, the Russian Five. It was this line of five Russian players who were brought to the Red Wings and ended up winning several Stanley Cups. Growing up, I would watch Tom Clancy films with my dad, where the Russians were always the bad guys; and then I would watch the Detroit Red Wings, where the Russians were the good guys. It caused this cognitive dissonance in my mind, this contradiction that I wanted to study more. So I pursued Russian studies and international relations in college, and I guess the rest is history."],["As the conflict in Ukraine intensifies, the Western world confronts a pivotal moment that will define its global leadership for years to come. The decision to withhold military aid risks not only undermining solidarity but also signalling weakness that could embolden further aggression and escalate conflicts into neighbouring regions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWestern nations must understand the prolonged nature of the standoff with Russia. Doubts about Russia's future must be dispelled, and fears of its potential dissolution should not dictate policy. The current state of Russia, maintaining a quasi-imperial stance, poses significant threats to global security, including the uncontrolled proliferation of missile and nuclear technologies among adversarial states.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFailure to support Eastern European democracies sends a clear message globally that the era of Western dominance in global affairs is waning. This reluctance could potentially lead to a new era of instability characterised by localised conflicts and the ominous spectre of a major global war, possibly involving nuclear weapons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe current ceasefire in Ukraine may prove to be a precursor to potential broader global conflicts. Observers note with concern the West's apparent reluctance or inability to address global challenges. This hesitance emboldens proponents of global realignment, who are increasingly stirring conflicts in the Middle East, East and South Asia, and the Persian Gulf. Russia's actions in Ukraine serve as a catalyst, encouraging proxies worldwide to challenge the existing global order.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe West is currently being tested on its ability to confront contemporary challenges decisively. Failure to do so could lead to scenarios where critical international corridors, such as the Suwalki Corridor, will fall under threat, or where aggression against Baltic states becomes a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRussian society's deep-seated resentment and nostalgia for its former imperial status exacerbate global tensions. Western democracies must acknowledge their historical responsibilities and the immense international pressures they will face should they fail to adequately support Ukraine with the necessary military aid.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReduced aid to Ukraine not only places the United States and other Western nations under international scrutiny but also shifts the burden of historical responsibility onto them for potentially exacerbating a global crisis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is crucial for NATO to maintain comprehensive support particularly through military aid to Ukraine. The economic and strategic costs of countering Russian ambitions in Ukraine far outweigh the costs of preventive measures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is not solely Ukraine's struggle; the democratic free world must adopt a resolute stance against the current regime in Moscow. This includes setting clear conditions for ending the conflict, maximising Ukraine's military capabilities, and diplomatically isolating Russia to prevent future aggression.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTimely provision of arms and ammunition to Ukraine is critical to avoid scenarios where NATO must invoke Article 5 of its Treaty as a last resort.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe West faces a critical juncture where its decisions will resonate globally. By unequivocally supporting Ukraine with military aid it needs, the West can demonstrate its commitment to international stability and reaffirm its leadership in an increasingly tumultuous world. The consequences of indecision or half-hearted support would be catastrophic, spawning a dangerous new global order that would threaten peace and security worldwide."],["To mark NATO's 75th Anniversary summit in Washington, D.C., the Quincy Institute invited leading U.S. and European analysts to comment on the future of the alliance. While differing greatly in their assessment both of NATO's role to date and of how they would like to see it develop in the future, all agree that NATO is facing an exceptionally difficult and dangerous period in its history.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNATO likes to describe itself as \"the most successful alliance in history\" not because it won a war, but because during the Cold War it deterred a Soviet attack on Western Europe and thereby prevented a new world war. What is too often forgotten, however, is that war was prevented not just by NATO solidarity, but also by NATO caution. Successive U.S. administrations -- fully backed by their European allies -- rejected calls for aggressive policies aimed at \"rolling back\" Soviet power in Eastern Europe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince the end of the Cold War, by contrast, NATO has become committed to rolling back Russian power even in former Soviet countries on Russia's own borders. As a result of the clash between this and Moscow's determination to maintain a sphere of influence, NATO now finds itself in a proxy conflict with Moscow on the European Continent itself. If this turns into direct war, there is a good chance that it will end with a nuclear exchange. At that point, the question of the future role of NATO will become meaningless, if only because there will be nobody left to ask it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf direct war can be avoided, most analysts predict that mutual hostility between Russia and the West will continue for the foreseeable future, and will involve the risk of further clashes around Russia's borders -- for example, over the future of Belarus and Russian access to the exclave of Kaliningrad across NATO territory in Lithuania. How great this threat will be depends on how the war in Ukraine eventually ends, and whether it is through a compromise peace or a petering out into an endless semifrozen conflict.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnalysts agree that NATO's European members will definitely try to rearm, especially if Donald Trump is reelected and U.S. commitment to Europe seems uncertain. Their efforts in this direction will, however, be hampered by economic stagnation, the conflicting demands of increasingly endangered budgets for health and social welfare, and the resistance of European countries to pooling their military production. In an effort to please Washington and ensure that the U.S. maintains its military presence in Europe, NATO is also likely to make public gestures toward a global role and the containment of China.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf the U.S. does pull back from Europe to any significant extent, NATO is likely to abandon its expansionist program of recent decades and limit itself to the defense of its existing members. This shift would, however, lead to considerable tensions between NATO members over policy toward Russia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne notable result of the war in Ukraine has been the almost complete disappearance from NATO discussions of the threat of climate change, previously described as \"existential.\" Nor does NATO have any strategy for the stabilization of countries to its south, or for addressing illegal migration across the Mediterranean. A few decades from now, however, the growth of these dangers may render many of NATO's existing preoccupations irrelevant.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Anatol Lieven, Eurasia Program Director, Quincy Institute\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince the end of the Cold War, NATO has gone through many incarnations: NATO, the agent of transformation to bring Eastern Europe into the league of Western democracies. NATO, the fighter in the war against terrorism. NATO, the cybersleuth. The democracy-builder. The rules-based order enforcer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd finally, at its 75 anniversary, NATO seems to be going back to its original mission: a collective defense pact to keep Europe safe -- and Russia out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is not surprising that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has energized the organization and reaffirmed the importance of Article 5 to all member states, big or small. NATO is no longer \"brain-dead\" and certainly has the capacity to deter Russia from attacking its member states.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut there still is much to do for the alliance to retain its relevance into the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first is creation of benchmarks and incentives for members to do more for their own defense, so Europe can reduce its reliance on the United States as its sole security guarantor. No matter who gets to the White House in November, American public sentiment is shifting in ways that are certain to have long-term implications for U.S. commitment to European security.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt a time when Washington views China and the Indo-Pacific as the foremost strategic challenge, Europeans need to develop industrial capabilities so as to have the freedom to make independent decisions for their own destiny. That inevitably means increasing military spending and manufacturing to complement the U.S. role in European security today and develop more autonomous reflexes tomorrow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNATO also needs to have a clear-eyed view of what its endgame in Ukraine is. Despite the slogan \"Ukraine's defense is Europe's defense,\" Ukraine's Western backers do not have a unified vision for where Ukraine fits in Europe's security. While supporting Ukraine's ability to defend itself against Russian aggression has been critical for the alliance, given that Russia is far from losing the war, it's time to start thinking of how this war ends -- in ways that preserve Ukraine's sovereignty and build a new security architecture for Europe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUkraine's theory of victory is increasingly looking unachievable to its Western backers. It's not hard to imagine negotiations for a ceasefire -- even with continued Russian occupation in parts of Ukraine -- at some point over the next few years. The U.S. and its allies need to be able to provide sufficient security guarantees for Ukraine, so its leaders and society have the confidence to accept a bitter peace -- and embark toward a more desirable future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat means a smaller but stronger Ukraine -- and NATO can be a critical piece of that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat role NATO plays in negotiations to end the war will define the future of the alliance -- and the nature of strategic stability with a nuclear Russia. If NATO can play some role in the creation of a postconflict Ukraine, even in the absence of full membership for Ukraine, it will remain relevant in Europe's future security architecture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, none of this might happen. Europe may remain divided on the question of strategic autonomy, with many member states following the U.S. lead on geopolitical challenges. There may not be consensus inside the alliance for an active role for an endgame in Ukraine -- leaving the matter entirely to Washington. America's strategic involvement with the Indo-Pacific might make individual member states more eager to strike bilateral arrangements with Washington -- hollowing out NATO's core mission or creating an internal constituency that wants to steer the alliance more toward greater competition with China.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat, I am afraid, would mean that NATO's perpetual search for a mission will continue into its fourth quarter-century and well into the next generation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAsli Aydintasbas is a Visiting Fellow at the Brookings Institution's foreign policy program and a Senior Associate Fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.'\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the European theater, conventional deterrence and defense should be ensured by Europeans. The 300,000 troops in a high state of readiness that the NATO New Force Model envisages on the eastern flank should be European troops. And they should need but a single American to be fully operational: SACEUR.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs it is, however, those 300,000 troops will still be dependent on American strategic enablers: intelligence, transport, deep strike, etc. Therefore, the European allies should go beyond the capability targets that NATO has currently assigned to them, and acquire all the necessary enablers themselves. That will undoubtedly require a collective effort, such as German Chancellor Scholz's Sky Shield initiative for a unified European air defense system.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is where the European Union can help. Not in trying to align capability development and defense planning of its member states under the E.U. flag. After exactly 25 years (the Common Security and Defence Policy was launched in 1999), it is clear that nations do not want this. But the E.U. does have instruments that work, or can work: the European Defence Fund to invest in research and industry and the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) to build modular multinational capabilities. Those should be put to use to help the European allies build a comprehensive, full-spectrum force package within NATO.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf the Europeans managed to achieve this, this force package would constitute a tangible European pillar of NATO, in terms of capabilities. The U.S. should fully support such a move, and refrain from irritating allies by seeing everything in terms of defense industrial interests. If Europeans spend more money, of course they will want to spend more (not all) of that on European equipment. Washington needs Europe to do more, for it will free up conventional military resources for its own priorities in Asia, while the American nuclear umbrella remains the ultimate guarantee.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIndeed, it is precisely because President Obama in 2012 already made Asia into the U.S.' No. 1 priority that Europeans must build a complete pillar within NATO. Twelve years later, it is about time the European allies stop convincing themselves that whatever happens, the U.S. cavalry will always be there. The reality is that in case of simultaneous wars in Europe and Asia, the U.S. is likely to prioritize the latter. Moreover, E.U. member states can only confidently support E.U. candidate country Ukraine (and Moldova and Georgia) without having to fear direct Russian retaliation, because NATO provides deterrence -- the conventional part of which Europeans must in the end ensure themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAn alliance that rests both on the U.S. and on an autonomous European pillar would be a much more balanced, and therefore more healthy alliance. But the Europeans should also build this pillar to prepare for less-healthy scenarios. If domestic politics lead the U.S. to reduce its commitment to NATO, the Europeans should be ready to seamlessly take over any task that the U.S. might withdraw from. Strategy is all about being prepared to uphold your interests, whatever comes to pass.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProf. Sven Biscop is the Director of the Europe in the World program at Egmont -- The Royal Institute for International Relations in Brussels. He also lectures at Ghent University.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs with so much else, NATO's future will ultimately depend on the future America chooses for itself. American policymakers would do well to reconsider the wisdom of continuing the 80-year American military presence in Europe. One alternative would be to pursue a \"less-than-grand\" strategy of American engagement that focuses primarily on a regional security arrangement between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada in anticipation of China's rise. If the U.S. is unlikely to ever fully exit the North Atlantic alliance, it might, at a minimum, step aside from NATO's integrated military command, in the manner of Charles de Gaulle in 1966.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGiven that it inhabits an entirely different part of the planet, Europe will naturally confront a set of different challenges from those facing the U.S. The most pressing, if various models are to be believed, will be the challenge posed by mass migration.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor Europe to have a happy future, it must tend to its own garden, and this necessitates a strategy of containing and mitigating the effects of climate migration. The strategy could be twofold: First, E.U. member states might set up a kind of climate mitigation fund for sub-Saharan Africa, which, in turn, would be coupled with a robust interdiction strategy against illegal migration in the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNATO, as currently conceived by transatlantic elites, is a danger to regional, and indeed, global stability: no NATO expansion, no war in Georgia in 2008; no NATO expansion, no war in Ukraine in 2022. Meanwhile, NATO's 2011 intervention in Libya resulted in the destruction of the Libyan state and mass migration flows across the Mediterranean.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSen. Richard Lugar's indelible phrase, \"Out of area or out of business,\" implied that to survive, NATO had to go hunting for work outside of its borders -- and in the three decades that followed Lugar's recommendation, it did. But it turns out that there is plenty of \"in-area\" work for NATO to do -- only contrary to what transatlantic elites constantly tell us, that work doesn't have to do with the Russians. The threat to Europe's future will not come from its east, it will come from its south -- and the challenge will not be a military one. It will be humanitarian.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo successfully deal with this, NATO should adopt a medium- to long-term strategy of targeted devolution -- its primary focus would be to defend Europe's borders -- and therefore its prosperity, its identity, and its security. The idea that NATO now has to go further and further \"out of area\" to the Indo-Pacific, is deeply misconceived -- instead, in the coming decades NATO should transform itself into a pan-European coast guard and border patrol -- perhaps in some combination with the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) and the European Gendarmerie Force.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the end, if NATO is to actually serve a useful role in securing Europe's future, it needs to abandon its pretensions of being a \"global policeman\" and become, instead, a cop on the beat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJames Carden is a contributing writer for foreign affairs at The Nation. He served as a policy advisor to the Special Representative for Intergovernmental Affairs and the Office of Russia Affairs at the US State Department.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the next generation, the NATO alliance should be prudent about both development and change. Historically, the alliance has excelled at being what it formally is: a defensive military alliance. The alliance had been created to deter the Soviet Union, which it did for the duration of the Cold War. Now its task is to deter Russia. Although Russia's invasion of Ukraine has destabilized Russia's relations with the West, NATO territory has not been attacked, and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of NATO member states has not been challenged by Russia. NATO's most important responsibility is to ensure that this remains the case.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNATO's self-definition as a defensive military alliance does not mean it can or should turn inward. Tensions between Russia on the one hand and Europe and the United States on the other are going to remain high for years, if not for decades. Even if NATO is unable to incorporate new states into the alliance -- Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus, or states in the Balkans and in the South Caucasus -- NATO should be conceptualized as the inner circle of a two-layered strategy designed to contain the spread of Russian military power.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNATO should not be directly involved in the war in Ukraine or in subsidiary wars that flow out from Russia's invasion of Ukraine (in Moldova, say, or in Georgia). Yet NATO members should be deeply committed to ensuring Ukraine's security. Were Russia to conquer Ukraine, NATO's deterrent work would be rendered vastly more difficult. Were the Kremlin to see its war in Ukraine as a dead end, Russia would be easier to deter throughout Europe. In this way does Ukraine's security reflect the overall health of the NATO alliance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNATO runs two separate risks in its possible course of development and change. These risks can be characterized as overreach and underreach.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOverreach would entail the blurring of lines in the existing struggle between NATO and Russia. If the alliance is not disciplined, it could allow several things to happen: direct forms of conflicts between its members and Russia; direct involvement (of the alliance) in the war; and lack of clarity about NATO's mission, which is to say lack of clarity about whether NATO is a defensive military alliance or an alliance geared toward expeditionary ventures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNATO has been involved in wars previously -- in Afghanistan and in Libya. NATO has never been involved in a war with a nuclear power. NATO's strategic purpose is to avoid war with Russia or to make such war impossible. Overreach leading to unwanted escalation and in effect to a Russia-NATO war would be catastrophic. It could lead to a nuclear exchange, or it could lead to NATO's backing down (to prevent a nuclear exchange) and thus to NATO's undermining of confidence in the integrity and purpose of the alliance itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnderreach would occur were NATO to be unconcerned with the territory outside its formal perimeter. Were NATO to think of itself as \"fortress NATO,\" preoccupied only with the defense of member states, it could find itself in an increasingly precarious position.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWere Ukraine and Moldova to follow the trajectory of Belarus, NATO would face the Russian military across a very long border: Kaliningrad and Belarus in the north; Ukraine and Moldova in the south and on the Black Sea. The Balkans could become a zone of active contestation. This would be a great multiplicity of challenges for NATO, which Russia could exploit to gain advantage, to instill fear in alliance members, and to compel the United States to pull away from Europe and to concentrate on matters closer to home. Over time, underreach could weaken the alliance dramatically.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNATO will succeed in future years if it can find the golden mean. This means not falling into outright war with Russia; this means preserving the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a Ukrainian state and polity; and this means keeping Russia at bay in the many gray areas that surround the NATO alliance. In sum, NATO's challenges in 2024 are greater than they were in 1949, when the alliance was created. Thus, its adaptability and strategic acumen will have to be greater as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMichael Kimmage is a Professor of History at the Catholic University of America.

His most recent book is Collisions: The War in Ukraine and the Origins of the New Global Instability.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe best development for NATO that one should wish for, I believe (even if the odds against its happening appear daunting at present), is that it should return to its fundamentals: Prevent war, in accordance to its obligation not just to defend all the signatories of the treaty but also to commit itself, in the words of the treaty, \"not to enter into any international commitments that conflicted with the treaty\" and to adhere \"to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe U.N. Charter states, as its first objective, \"to maintain international peace and security\" and \"uphold international law.\" In other words, in a more perfect world, NATO should work toward peace and not toward managing conflicts solely through military means in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, how NATO probably will develop and change is a very different matter. In his new strategic concept presented at the Madrid Summit in June 2022, Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg set out five points for the development of NATO. Only one of these, \"taking a global outlook,\" was really \"new.\" This \"global outlook\" involves extending the treaty's mandate exponentially. NATO would develop into a supranational organism with tentacles reaching into many corners of the world, if not all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the other hand, a new generation of populist politicians in the United States and Europe will probably not want to take such a \"global outlook\" but will retreat, if trends are anything to go by, to their own shores in the perhaps-mistaken idea that conflicts here and there will not affect them directly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, the same conflicts ongoing now might already have escalated to the extent that, even a generation ahead, their consequences will instead produce a general desire to project strength, whatever the human consequences. Thus, European nations will have rearmed and retrained their military and will possibly no longer accept the sole leadership of the U.S. in NATO affairs. It will then take a very astute politician to rein in everyone's power instincts: Failing the presence of such a man or woman, NATO could actually break apart amidst exacerbated rivalries, including economic ones, and conflicting nationalist postures and interests.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnne Kraatz is a Non-Resident Fellow at the Quincy Institute. She was a Senior Fellow at the Institute for Open Diplomacy in Paris, and a member of the Executive Committee of Democrats Abroad in France, in charge of organizing and moderating public debates on U.S. foreign affairs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNATO was created in 1949 to protect its members against the Soviet threat. During the Cold War, NATO was also very aware of the risks of escalation, some of which were existential. Accordingly, the main aims were to deter armed conflict and to ensure a reliable defense capability. In addition, the alliance sought very early on to contain the risk of a military conflict breaking out by respecting the Soviet Union's central \"red lines\"; it did not even shy away from dialogue and verifiable agreements with an opponent not considered as trustworthy. This attitude found classic expression in the dual strategy from 1967 (the so-called Harmel Report), which is still valid for NATO today. According to this, on the basis of a guaranteed defense capability, NATO was ready for dialogue and d\u00e9tente with the opposing side.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter 1989, the bipolar confrontation only seemed to have disappeared. It has not been possible to integrate Russia into a new European security order. Rather, Putin saw that, in particular from the beginning of the 2000s onward, the policies of the U.S. and NATO had not taken into account Russian superpower interests, and that \"red lines\" had been crossed, especially by promising future NATO membership to Ukraine and Georgia. This was also due to the arrogant \"unipolar\" actions of the U.S. administration under George W. Bush and its insensitive focus on military superiority and expanding its and NATO's sphere of influence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eParticularly due to the Russian aggression against Ukraine and the emergence of a Cold War 2.0, it is now important to heed the lessons of NATO's 75-year history:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless of the outcome of the elections in the U.S., however, the European partners must increase their defense efforts in order to focus more on Europe's own security and to be able to assert themselves in the looming phase of global geopolitical upheaval. If this is not possible within the framework of the E.U., a \"core Europe,\" primarily under the leadership of France and Germany, should proceed in order to achieve strategic autonomy in the military area too. This is, moreover, the only way to limit defense spending. At this crucial juncture, the alliance must pursue with sound judgment a realistic security policy aimed at reestablishing sustainable peace and cooperation in Europe and the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eR\u00fcediger L\u00fcedeking is a former German diplomat who served as Permanent Representative to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and Ambassador to Belgium.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is imperative for NATO to become more balanced between America and Europe when it comes to burden-sharing. The European members of NATO should organize themselves in a way that they would be able to conduct military operations in their own neighborhood without the direct support of the Americans. While this does not need to be done by the European Union, the E.U. has a key role to play when it comes to providing joint financing for defense procurement and to help develop a European military-industrial policy. Key European members of NATO that are not members of the E.U. -- including the United Kingdom, Norway, and Turkey -- have a lot to offer to such a European pillar of the alliance, and they should be fully integrated into any European defense architecture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSuch a \"rebalancing\" of the Atlantic alliance -- with the goal of the European members to spend a roughly equal amount of money on defense and having similar military capabilities -- would guarantee that NATO will endure through the 21 century, as it would no longer be subject to the whims of American domestic politics. After all, an international alliance sharing both common interests and common values is equally valuable for both Americans and Europeans, as it would increase both North America's and Europe's influence in the rest of the world, and benefit its citizens by providing stability and security in which their mixed-market economies can continue to grow and thrive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn reality, however, there is a substantial risk that European efforts will fall well short of what is needed to achieve a proper rebalancing of NATO. For political economy reasons, current and future American presidents will continue to encourage European allies to buy weapons and military hardware from the United States, and E.U. internal discord over joint financing and the interests of national defense industries will prevent integration of European military procurement. Aging European societies will only increase their demands for more social welfare at the expense of military spending.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn this scenario, the United States will continue to exert a disproportionate sway over the alliance, which will maintain the unhappy equilibrium of American dominance and European free-riding within NATO, with those perceptions of each side reinforced across the Atlantic, and increased uncertainty over America's future commitment to the alliance. There may also be pressure to expand NATO beyond the Northern Atlantic space, and invite America's democratic allies in the Pacific, including Japan, South Korea, and Australia, to join. NATO would then serve as the U.S. vehicle to contain not only Russia, but also China. If this development materializes, it has the potential of further increasing geopolitical tension between the West and the rest as well as within NATO.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMatthias Matthijs holds the Dean Acheson Chair at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and is a Senior Fellow for Europe at the Council on Foreign Relations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAn armistice agreement in Ukraine -- which now seems likely in the foreseeable future -- should include a commitment by NATO and Russia to set verifiable limitations on conventional deployments on either side of a demilitarized truce line. This could either be considered a revamping and redesign of the Conventional Forces in Europe agreement or could be more circumscribed and less ambitious. In either case, for the U.S. in particular, structuring a durable peace would require reactivating diplomatic capacities sidelined during the zero-sum struggle between Russia and NATO.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe postwar framework should explicitly allow the European members of NATO to increase national defense outlays to achieve a rough balance of conventional capability vis \u00e0 vis Russia. This would require U.S. acceptance of a collective E.U. role in defense industrial development. The aim of this Europeanization of NATO would be to render the U.S. conventional military force presence in Europe less essential. The U.S. would still extend its nuclear umbrella over NATO members in Europe, but NATO's European pillar would become more capable and have a greater voice in decision-making. NATO should shift its focus from expansion eastward to supporting Europe's development of its conventional defense capabilities, an enterprise likely to take at least a decade.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNATO would remain the principal framework for mutual defense of the Transatlantic West. Russia and NATO should work to revive stabilizing measures to diminish the risk of renewed conflict in Europe, as in the years following the Cuban missile crisis. The restoration of nuclear arms control agreements should be given priority.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe hard lessons of the last few years have exposed the failure of military power and even the harshest economic sanctions to resolve interstate conflict without unacceptable risk to the broader security interests of all parties. Diplomatic contacts between Russia and the United States would have to be put on a more sober and patient track.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWithout such agreements, the continuation of the war in Ukraine on its current trajectory carries the danger of escalation to direct confrontation between NATO and Russia. The determination of the U.S. and its partners to project unity and resolve in defense of Ukraine has taken on a life of its own and functions as an instrument within an information war, favoring \"narrative\" over reality. The summit in Washington in July risks being absorbed almost entirely in avoidance of any unwelcome controversy over the question of Ukraine's path to membership and in the frantic attempt to make the prospect of eventual NATO membership credible to Ukraine's leadership. Any open debate and frank reflection around shoring up NATO under a possible Trump presidency and exploring scenarios for the end of the war will, at best, remain behind closed doors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe nostalgic reification of NATO has played a big role in producing the dilemma now facing us. The July summit will celebrate the revival of U.S. prestige within NATO, the near-unanimity among European allies in supporting \"victory\" for Ukraine, and the restored relevance of NATO in the face of a renewed military threat from Russia to the alliance. The papering over of challenges to NATO and the failure to design and implement reforms will continue so long as there is no consensus around achievable war aims and no effort to find a negotiated end to the conflict.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDr. Molly O'Neal is a Non-Resident Fellow at the Quincy Institute and a former U.S. Foreign Service Officer dealing with Eastern Europe, Russia, and Eurasia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlliances are ultimately arrangements between two or more states for security cooperation and are generally targeted against a particular adversary. NATO played this role during the Cold War, with Western European states, Canada, and the United States balancing potential Soviet ambitions on the Continent. Informed by this logic, many analysts predicted NATO's demise after the Cold War; indeed, the alliance's ability to endure and expand in scope (though not coherence and function) after 1991 at least partly motivates claims that the alliance's shared values and institutional anchoring will allow it to thrive in future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYet there is a simpler explanation for NATO's post-Cold War endurance that ought to give us pause as to NATO's future health. If alliances form largely in response to threats, it follows that they ought to end not simply when an old threat dies, but when a new threat emerges at the same time. From this perspective, the end of the Cold War saw the Soviet Union die, but because no new threat emerged, NATO could continue unimpeded. NATO became a Swiss Army Knife for spreading liberal values, fighting terrorism, and establishing an array of new goals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday, however, the situation is different: Domestic politics aside, we see a growing disconnect between European and American priorities. The United States is increasingly focused on China, so much so that the (overstated) China threat is one of the true points of bipartisan consensus in Washington. European states, on the other hand, are divided between those who see a pronounced threat from Russia and those who see an array of challenges from illegal migration and state instability along the southern maritime border.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgainst this backdrop, NATO's days may be numbered -- at least in its current form. States with diverging or divergent interests can try to paper over their differences. In a world of finite time and resources, however, differing priorities tend to drive alliances apart, as member states place their bets and act out of self-interest. With NATO, this may not result in an abrupt end to transatlantic cooperation, but it does imply a progressive weakening of the commitment, waning coordination, and a hollowing out of the alliance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf and as American and European attentions continue to part, the United States may increasingly pass the security buck to the European members of the alliance. Without the ability to steer European security policy, Washington may well look to reduce its exposure to European contingencies -- just as many in Europe may be increasingly growing reluctant to count on U.S. assistance amid a crisis in which, for self-interested reasons, Washington may be unwilling to help. A result could be a NATO that remains alive on paper but, in practice, is primarily a European show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis would not be a bad result for the United States. Indeed, the founders of the alliance actually wanted NATO to be a temporary expedient, a shield behind which Western Europe could recover from the devastation of the Second World War before taking on the hard task of balancing the Soviet Union. That original idea was lost for much of the last seven decades. Yet, as NATO celebrates its 75th birthday, geopolitical developments -- more so than domestic politics -- may bring the founders' vision back to the fore.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoshua Shifrinson is an Associate Professor in the School of Public Policy of the University of Maryland, and author of Rising Titans, Falling Giants: How Great Powers Exploit Power Shifts (2023).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow NATO should and will develop over the next generation depends entirely on a guess about what happens geopolitically.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFew alliances last even NATO's 75 years. As an institution, NATO is too weak to perpetuate itself against key members' wishes. The alliance will, as always, be fractious, and it's harder to manage with 32+ nations than with the original 12. The U.S. interest in sustaining NATO is in secular decline. Some have predicted that NATO cannot last without the U.S. And an E.U.-based version of NATO is perfectly conceivable if a President Trump or similar were to pull America out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, seen from the outside, it's reasonable to wonder whether NATO will even exist a generation from now. But, viewed from the inside, NATO has staying power. It exists not just to keep Russia out and America in, but to keep Western and Central Europe from disintegrating again along national lines. Presidents Putin and Trump have massively increased European incentives for hanging together -- preferably with but, if necessary, without America.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy guess is that a generation from now, NATO will still be in sustained military confrontation with Russia; Washington will still not want Europe -- its largest trading and investment partner -- to fall apart, even if the U.S. becomes a semidetached ally; and an E.U.-based alternative still could not rope in British, Turkish, and Norwegian capabilities as effectively.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn that anxious security context, NATO should develop a European pillar in tighter collaboration with the E.U., pursuing common European procurement goals and smoothing transatlantic defense industrial frictions through NATO's defense planning process. It should remain open to new members who can increase alliance security, including Ukraine. It should secure the Euro-Atlantic for America, leaving the U.S. and other individual allies to operate in the Indo-Pacific. It should be the arms control organization it claims to be, advancing proposals to Moscow to manage confrontation at lower levels of risk and higher levels of deterrence. It should work to be seen internationally as a valued stability generator in an unstable world, investing heavily in its partnerships for military professionalism under democratic political control.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd how will NATO in fact develop? Outlier possibilities exist for more significant damage to its cohesion and effectiveness from America's isolationism and China focus, E.U. ideology and incoherence, British and Turkish E.U. complications, Russian and Chinese erosions, and the continuing lack of a shared vision among allies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt will be both less European and less transatlantic than it needs to be, less robust and more threatening toward Moscow than it needs to be, more internally factional than it ought to be, and less confident than it should be about working intimately with the E.U. and U.N. on geographical and functional instabilities. It may have lost Hungary and Bulgaria to Russian influence, and it will have gained Ukraine, formally or otherwise. It will be badly divided over China. Strong anti-Americanism in Europe will complicate public politics, but Europe's structural inefficiencies will mean the U.S. is still the essential partner."],["Secretary of Defense Lloyd J.

Although Ukraine has the resources of more than 20 NATO countries behind it, the outcomes of several confrontations have been unacceptable to Zelensky, as they have not only failed to gain an advantage but have also resulted in disadvantages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that North Korea is also getting involved, it becomes even more unfavorable for Ukraine to reverse the situation. In this context, Zelensky has turned his attention to China, hoping that China can help resolve the crisis. It seems that Zelensky has forgotten his hostile attitude towards China at the Shangri-La Dialogue, where he openly criticized China for interfering with the \"Swiss Peace Summit.\" Now that he is in trouble, he turns to China for help. In fact, at the \"Swiss Peace Summit,\" which China did not attend, the world once again witnessed China's global influence. After China announced it would not participate in the summit, more than a dozen countries also declared they would not attend, including South Africa, India, and Brazil. These countries are either BRICS members or partners in China's \"Belt and Road\" initiative, clearly demonstrating China's influence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the other hand, Zelensky is also worried that if relations with China deteriorate, it might push China closer to Russia, which would be a significant loss. However, Zelensky's concerns are somewhat unnecessary. China has long made its stance clear: it remains neutral in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and does not take sides. China has consistently pushed for a political resolution to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. It is Ukraine's unwavering alignment with the U.S. and the West that has prolonged this conflict. The urgent task for Ukraine is to correct its attitude, recognize the fact that Russia holds the advantage on the front lines, and quickly come to the negotiating table. With the support of neutral countries like China, a peace plan that serves the interests of both parties should be reached to avoid further casualties."],["Finnish President Alexander Stubb stated that Russia's dependence on China has reached such a level that if the Chinese government wished, it could end the war in Ukraine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn an interview in Helsinki on Tuesday, President Stubb said, \"Russia is now very dependent on China.\" \"A single phone call from President Xi Jinping could resolve this crisis.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBloomberg reported that these remarks reflect the growing frustration among Ukraine's allies over China's perceived support for Russia's war efforts.

The \"Iskander\" missile, equipped with a cluster warhead, penetrated the Ukrainian air defense network and struck five Su-27 fighter jets. Among them, two were completely destroyed, and three were damaged. This has left some netizens puzzled, wondering how Ukraine still has so many Su-27s after more than two years of conflict. Can Russian forces shoot down F-16s? Today, Lin will discuss whether the undefeated record of F-16s against Soviet and Russian aircraft might be broken.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Ukraine inherited approximately 77 Su-27 fighter jets. However, due to economic collapse and military corruption, by the time the Russia-Ukraine war began, only 32 of these jets were operational. Surprisingly, despite the war lasting over two years, these 32 jets have not been completely destroyed. What\u2019s the reason behind this? In reality, Ukraine has very few Su-27s left, probably just over 10, as most have been shot down. The recent destruction of five Su-27s in a single strike is a significant blow to the Ukrainian Air Force.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason Ukraine still retains over 10 Su-27s is not due to the strength of its air force but because of its long-term strategy of keeping these jets in reserve. For instance, while Russian forces might deploy aircraft 30 times a day, Ukrainian forces might only deploy one or two sorties. Most of the time, Ukrainian Su-27s, MiG-29s, and Su-24s are kept in reserve, resulting in lower operational rates and fewer losses. After all, these aircraft represent the entirety of Ukraine\u2019s air force; once they are gone, there are no replacements.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe timing of the Russian airstrike is also very strategic. The F-16 had just completed its first attack on the eastern Ukrainian battlefield. Although this attack was a probing one and did not cause significant damage to Russian forces, it marked the real deployment of the F-16 in the eastern Ukrainian theater. By attacking the Ukrainian airbase at this moment, Russian forces aimed to send a warning to the F-16s. Considering the underperformance of the Russian Aerospace Forces and air defense systems, many have doubted whether Russian forces can shoot down F-16s. Such doubts are entirely unnecessary.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Russia-Ukraine war is the largest-scale conflict with the smallest technological gap between the two sides since the Cold War. As long as the F-16s enter eastern Ukraine, it is only a matter of time before they are shot down. Every weapon system incurs losses; the key is whether it can be replenished in time. As early as 2018, Houthi forces used old R-27 air-to-air missiles launched from the ground to accurately shoot down two Saudi F-15 fighter jets. The Saudi F-15s were custom versions with better performance than the U.S. military\u2019s own, while the Ukrainian F-16s are early export versions. Without a technological gap, it is almost impossible for the F-16s to achieve zero losses in the eastern Ukrainian battlefield.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoreover, the first batch of F-16s received by Ukraine is too small, only 4 to 6 aircraft. It is impossible to achieve air superiority with just 4 to 6 F-16s. Their primary function is to launch AIM-120 long-range air-to-air missiles to push back Russian Su-34 fighter-bombers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe destruction of five Su-27s indicates that the Ukrainian forces are incapable of adequately protecting their airbases. To prevent the newly deployed F-16s from being destroyed immediately, Ukraine has applied to station them at neighboring countries' airbases, including Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough the Russian S-300 and S-400 air defense systems have not performed as expected in combat, overhyping the F-16 will only lead to its quicker downfall from grace."],["**Today's Content: Look at China Website - Prohibition on Creating Mirror Sites.

Recruitment billboards have now appeared in major Russian cities like St. Petersburg and Novosibirsk.

Additionally, the appearance of the fuel train suggests that the Russian army is actively developing a \"railway corridor\" from Donbas to Crimea, which will undoubtedly become a key target for Ukrainian FPV drones.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the other hand, Russian attacks continue. On July 1, with the assistance of Russian drones, the Russian army used Iskander missiles to attack the Ukrainian Myrhorod Air Base. A Russian blogger claimed that at least three F-16s were destroyed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUkrainian Air Force official Yury Ignat admitted that the Myrhorod Air Base was hit by missiles. Satellite images show that the Russian army destroyed at least one Su-27 aircraft, with several other aircraft damaged, but there were no F-16s at this base.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome analysts believe that the Ukrainian army's placement of unprotected Su-27 fighters within the range of Iskander missiles is more of a strategy to confuse the Russian army, possibly aiming to deplete Russian missiles. If these planes were operational, they should be fully fueled and ready to take off. However, reports suggest that these planes might be non-flying Su-27 spare parts that have been parked at the airport for a long time, lacking any camouflage or air defense measures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegarding the F-16, Russian media have reported that Ukrainian F-16 fighters were detected over Kherson, accompanied by NATO AWACS, but there was no engagement.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDutch Defense Minister Kajsa Ollongren recently stated that two F-16 fighters will be sent to Ukraine.

In emergencies, the missile system might mistakenly identify and attack non-military targets, causing unintended harm to nearby residents and infrastructure. Additionally, radiation and explosion hazards may also arise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFurthermore, Russia has turned Crimea into a heavily guarded area, setting up over 233 military bases and using civilians as human shields. Despite the militarization, Russia still encourages tourism, putting civilians at risk and violating international law.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few days ago, a missile hit a seaside resort in Crimea, causing hundreds of casualties. Ukraine then paused its attacks on Crimea for a few days. Ukrainian military expert Roman Svitan stated in an interview that this pause gave the Russians a chance to regroup, disperse air defense systems, and move them to new locations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSvitan believes that the Ukrainian army should have no reservations and must maintain high-intensity strikes to destroy the Russian air defense systems on the island, ideally striking daily.

The extent of the damage is still unclear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the Bakhmut war zone, Ukrainian Air Force aircraft used precision AASM-250 \"Hammer\" aerial bombs to bomb a Russian gathering point in the northern suburb of Paraskoviivka, achieving significant results.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, Ukrainian forces stationed in high-rise buildings are currently suffering heavy bombardment from Russian TOS-2.

As of July 1, 2024, Russian battlefield losses have approached the 550,000 mark.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNotably, Ukraine's elite 47th Brigade is engaged in combat with two Russian brigades and five regiments in the Pokrovsk direction, eliminating 975 Russian soldiers in half a month. In the fierce battles on the northern flank of Avdiivka lasting eight months, the 47th Brigade has at least three times completely destroyed the combat capabilities of Russia's 15th and 30th Brigades.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Ukrainian army pointed out that Russian soldiers are unwilling to be captured, often using light weapons or grenades to kill themselves or asking comrades to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIncreasing evidence suggests that Russian soldiers are nearly depleted. Recruitment billboards have appeared in major Russian cities like St. Petersburg and Novosibirsk. To attract new recruits, the authorities have raised the compensation to 1.3 million rubles, a 650% increase from 200,000 rubles two years ago. Additionally, these cities now frequently see funeral processions and retired personnel with prosthetics, a situation previously unseen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**Russia's Most Advanced Artillery Destroyed; Ukrainian Drones Achieve New Successes**\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, Russian forces mainly launch attacks in large infantry groups, with artillery continuously bombarding. Armored convoys are rarely seen, but it is expected that Russian forces may soon regroup large armored units for an offensive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn Stepove village near Avdiivka, Ukraine's 109th Brigade discovered a newly arrived Russian 2S19 self-propelled howitzer at a firing position, which was quickly destroyed by Ukrainian drones and FPVs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReportedly, Russia has concentrated its remaining most advanced equipment in the Pokrovsk direction, but progress has been minimal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently, a Roniny drone from Ukraine's 56th Independent Mechanized Brigade hit a Russian fuel train near Tokmak in Zaporizhzhia Oblast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe outcome of the drone strike on the 2TE116 diesel locomotive is unclear, as the drone could not transmit images after the explosion. \"Defense Express\" noted that this attack occurred within 20-30 kilometers of the frontline, indicating improved Ukrainian drone technology. The presence of the fuel train suggests that Russia is actively developing a \"rail corridor\" from Donbas to Crimea, which will likely become a key target for Ukrainian FPV drones.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the other hand, Russian attacks continue. On July 1, with the support of Russian drones, Russian forces used Iskander missiles to strike Ukraine's Myrhorod Air Base. A Russian blogger claimed that at least three F-16s were destroyed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUkrainian Air Force official Yury Ignat admitted that Myrhorod Air Base was hit by missiles. Satellite images show that at least one Su-27 aircraft was destroyed, and several other aircraft were damaged, but there were no F-16s at the base.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnalysts believe that the exposed Su-27s within Iskander missile range might be a strategy to deceive Russian forces, possibly to deplete their missiles. If these planes were operational, they should be fueled and ready for takeoff. However, reports suggest these planes might be non-flying Su-27 parts, parked at the base for a long time without any camouflage or air defense measures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegarding the F-16s, Russian media reported that Ukrainian F-16s were detected over Kherson, accompanied by NATO AWACS, but no engagement occurred.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDutch Defense Minister Ollongren recently stated that two F-16 fighters will be sent to Ukraine and can be used anywhere, including inside Russia.

Russia claimed to have shot down all missiles, but a Russian logistics base was suspected to be hit, with losses still being clarified.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe repeatedly attacked Russian forces are now like \"frightened birds.\" On July 1, they installed Tor M2KM surface-to-air missile systems near Sevastopol beach.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis move significantly endangers local civilians, as surface-to-air missile systems are high-value military targets that attract enemy attacks. In emergencies, these systems might misidentify and attack non-military targets, causing unintended harm to nearby residents and infrastructure. Additionally, radiation and explosion hazards may arise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRussia has turned Crimea into a heavily fortified area, setting up over 233 military bases and using civilians as human shields. Despite militarization, Russia still encourages tourism, putting civilians at risk and violating international law.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few days ago, a missile hit a seaside resort in Crimea, causing hundreds of casualties. Ukraine then paused attacks on Crimea for a few days. Ukrainian military expert Roman Svitan said this pause allowed Russia to regroup, disperse air defense systems, and relocate them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSvitan believes Ukraine should have no reservations and must maintain high-intensity strikes to destroy Russian air defense systems on the island, ideally daily. Russian forces need 1.5 to 2 days to relocate air defense systems, and continuous strikes can weaken their ability to protect themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eObservers believe that once Crimea's air defense systems are depleted, Ukraine's F-16s and even landing forces could strike Crimea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**Aerial Bombs Strike Russian Forces; Motorcycle Charges Appear on the Frontline**\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the Kharkiv region, Ukrainian forces used precision bombs, various artillery, and drones to heavily strike Russian forces, forcing them to redeploy reinforcements. Ukraine has sent tens of thousands of soldiers to Kharkiv, significantly outnumbering Russian forces but has not launched a major offensive. Analysts believe Ukraine aims to achieve its goals through continuous attrition of Russian forces. The Kharkiv battle will become a burden for Russian forces.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReports indicate that Russian assault teams entered Ukraine's Sumy region to create new hotspots, but their assembly points were directly destroyed by Ukrainian JDAM bombs. Provocations in Sumy will not yield good results.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the Kherson region, Ukrainian missiles struck a Russian base in Nova Kakhovka on the left bank, causing multiple explosions and a fire. The extent of the damage is unclear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the Bakhmut sector, Ukrainian Air Force jets used precision AASM-250 \"Hammer\" bombs to strike Russian gathering points in the northern suburbs of Paraskoviivka, achieving significant results.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, Ukrainian forces stationed in high-rise buildings are currently under heavy bombardment by Russian TOS-2 systems. The TOS-2 uses 220mm rockets filled with highly flammable triethylaluminum. This agent can self-ignite in air and explode upon contact with water, causing severe corrosion to human skin and continuing to burn even when buried. Ukrainian casualties are expected to be significant.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNazar Voloshyn, spokesperson for Ukraine's Joint Task Force on Khortytsia Island, stated in a live broadcast on July 1 that Russian forces are now heavily attacking in the Horlivka-Toretsk direction, with the offensive on Chasiv Yar weakening.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVoloshyn noted that Russia's attack on Toretsk aims to pressure Chasiv Yar from another direction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnalysts believe that Russia's attack on Toretsk is due to heavy casualties in Chasiv Yar, leading to war-weariness among soldiers, prompting a shift to continue attrition elsewhere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eObservers also noted that to avoid Ukrainian drone attacks, Russian forces have started using motorcycles to transport ammunition to the front and have launched motorcycle charges. On July 1, Ukraine's 72nd Brigade destroyed a Russian motorcycle charge in Vuhledar. This may indicate worsening equipment conditions for Russian forces.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe \"Southern Daily\" used AI models to examine satellite images of 87 Russian military bases, including 16 storing tanks, artillery, and armored personnel carriers. The results show a significant reduction in Russia's armored vehicles since February 24, 2022.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe \"New York Times\" reported that the new motorcycle charge tactic is spreading on the frontlines, adding more chaos and brutality to the battles. Russian forces are trying to use the speed of motorcycles to cross open ground, adapting to a battlefield filled with mines and drones. Although this tactic is highly risky, it addresses the critical challenge of crossing open ground under drone and artillery surveillance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSergeant Sapsan of Ukraine's 47th Mechanized Brigade stated, \"They dismount and start shooting after getting close...

U.S. media revealed that Trump's aides are planning a \"complete reorientation\" of NATO, making Europe the dominant force while the U.S. takes a back seat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePolitico Exposes Trump's Complete Reorientation Plan for NATO\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn July 2, the U.S. political news website Politico reported that U.S. presidential candidate Trump has repeatedly criticized NATO member countries for not fairly sharing military expenses. Therefore, there is concern about when he might abandon the 75-year-old North Atlantic Treaty Alliance if re-elected. However, interviews with former Trump national security officials and defense experts who might serve in Trump's second term suggest that Trump is unlikely to completely withdraw from NATO but will continue to demand that European member countries significantly increase their military spending.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn an interview, defense expert Dan Caldwell, familiar with the internal thoughts of Trump's national security advisor circle, said, \"We really have no choice.\" He cited the rising U.S. national debt, recruitment difficulties in the military, and the weak foundation of the U.S. defense industry as challenges in facing Moscow and Beijing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTrump and his presidential campaign team have not yet appointed a new national security team or publicly accepted a new agenda for NATO. However, discussions on related issues are ongoing within Trump's campaign team. Former officials and experts interviewed stated that if Trump wins, in his second term, the U.S. will retain its air forces and bases in Germany, the UK, and Turkey, as well as naval forces, to maintain the nuclear umbrella over Europe. Meanwhile, most infantry, armor, logistics, and artillery will eventually be handed over to European countries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCaldwell stated that this shift would involve \"a significant and substantial reduction in the U.S.'s security role, not being the primary provider of combat power in Europe, but providing support only in times of crisis.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother part of Trump's plan is a two-tier NATO system. This idea was first proposed by another former senior Trump administration official, retired Army Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg. It means that NATO member countries that have not met the goal of spending 2% of their GDP on defense budgets will not receive U.S. defense security guarantees.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough Article 5 of NATO stipulates that an attack on any member country is considered an attack on all member countries, requiring an immediate response from other members, Trump's foreign policy think tank members claim that the wording of Article 5 is flexible and does not require any member country to respond with military force.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo date, the U.S. is the largest contributor to the military alliance NATO, with a defense budget of about $860 billion, accounting for 68% of NATO's total defense budget in 2023. Jeremy Shapiro, research director at the pan-European think tank \"The European Council on Foreign Relations\" (ECFR), stated that a significant portion of the U.S. defense budget (about 3.5% of U.S. GDP) is used to defend Europe, although the Pentagon refuses to disclose specific amounts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKiron Skinner, former director of the U.S. State Department's Policy Planning Office during the Trump administration and a key figure in \"Project 2025,\" said, \"The U.S. is not the world's ATM. NATO can play an important role in the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific theaters, but we need more strategic thinking.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTrump's new NATO policy plan could also play a key role in quickly resolving the ongoing 2.5-year Russia-Ukraine war, which he believes \"should never have started.\" The Republican presidential candidate is considering reaching an agreement with Russian President Putin to decide which countries can join NATO, particularly Ukraine and Georgia. This would have a significant impact on NATO's vague commitment to Ukraine's future, a commitment the Biden administration is implementing without a timeline.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAccording to a national security expert familiar with Trump's thinking, who wished to remain anonymous, Trump \"is open to stopping NATO expansion and will not return to Ukraine's 1991 borders. This will be on the table. But this does not mean abandoning any other possibilities, including providing substantial weapons to Ukraine.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNATO is Preparing a Plan B for Ukraine\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn July 1, The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed U.S. and NATO allied officials, reported that during the summit in Washington, D.C., from July 9 to July 11, NATO will announce several new measures to address the impact of Trump's return to the White House on NATO's support for Ukraine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe report stated that NATO is planning new measures to protect support for Ukraine. This plan has been underway for months and is accelerating due to Biden's poor performance in the first U.S. presidential debate. NATO's measures include sending a new senior civilian official to Kyiv and establishing a new military command in Wiesbaden, western Germany, to coordinate military aid and training for Ukrainian forces from NATO member countries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe new military command in Wiesbaden is called \"NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine,\" consisting of about 700 U.S. and allied personnel from all NATO member countries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTrump has barely concealed his disappointment with NATO allies, repeatedly criticizing them for taking advantage of U.S. security assistance in Europe and failing to meet the NATO defense budget commitment (2% of GDP). In 2014, NATO member countries agreed to spend 2% of their GDP on defense budgets, but many countries have failed to meet this goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReuters reported that in recent years, NATO allies' defense budgets have been highly controversial, especially with former U.S. President Trump criticizing European allies for spending too little on their own security and relying on U.S. protection. Earlier this year, Trump hinted that he would not protect NATO allies whose defense budgets are less than 2% of GDP.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn June 17, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, during a meeting with U.S. President Biden at the White House, said that five years ago, fewer than ten NATO allies met the goal of spending at least 2% of GDP on defense budgets. He emphasized how NATO allies have increased their continuous military spending since Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStoltenberg said, \"In Europe and Canada, NATO allies' defense budgets have increased by 18% this year, the largest increase in decades. Twenty-three allies will spend 2% or more of their GDP on defense this year.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNATO Secretary-General Stoltenberg stated that when NATO leaders set the goal of spending 2% of GDP on defense budgets at the 2014 summit, only three allies, the U.S., Greece, and the UK, met this goal.

U.S. media disclosed that Trump's aides are planning a \"complete repositioning\" of NATO, making Europe the dominant force while the U.S. steps back.

Therefore, the outside world is concerned about when he might abandon the 75-year-old North Atlantic Treaty Alliance if he is re-elected as U.S. president. However, through interviews with former Trump national security officials and defense experts who might serve in Trump's second term, it is unlikely that Trump will completely withdraw from NATO but will continue to demand that European member countries significantly increase their military spending.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn an interview, defense expert Dan Caldwell, familiar with the internal thoughts of Trump's national security advisor circle, said, \"We really have no choice.\" He cited the rising U.S. national debt, weak military recruitment, and the fragile foundation of the U.S. defense industry as unable to meet the challenges from Moscow and Beijing authorities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTrump and his presidential campaign team have not yet appointed a new national security team nor publicly accepted NATO's new agenda. However, discussions on related topics are ongoing within Trump's campaign team. Former officials and experts interviewed said that if Trump wins, in his second term as U.S. president, the U.S. will retain its air forces and bases in Germany, the UK, and Turkey, as well as naval forces, to maintain the nuclear umbrella over Europe. At the same time, most infantry, armor, logistics, and artillery will eventually be handed over to European countries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCaldwell stated that this shift would involve \"a significant and substantial reduction in the U.S.'s security role, not being the primary provider of combat power in Europe, only providing support in times of crisis.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother part of Trump's team plan is a two-tier NATO system. This idea was first proposed by another former senior Trump administration official, retired Army Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg. It means that NATO member countries that have not yet achieved the goal of spending 2% of GDP on defense budgets will not receive U.S. defense security guarantees.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough NATO's Article 5 stipulates that an attack on any member country is considered an attack on all member countries, requiring an immediate response from other member countries, members of Trump's foreign policy think tank said that the wording of NATO's Article 5 is flexible and does not require any member country to respond with military force.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far, the U.S. is the largest contributor to the military alliance NATO, with a defense budget of about $860 billion, accounting for 68% of NATO's total defense budget in 2023. Jeremy Shapiro, research director at the pan-European think tank \"The European Council on Foreign Relations\" (ECFR), stated that a large part of the U.S. defense budget (about 3.5% of U.S. GDP) is used to defend Europe, although the Pentagon refuses to disclose specific amounts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKiron Skinner, former director of the U.S. State Department's Policy Planning Office during the Trump administration and a key figure in the \"Project 2025,\" said, \"The U.S. is not the world's ATM. NATO can play an important role in the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific theaters, but we need more strategic thinking.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTrump's new NATO policy plan may also play a key role in quickly resolving the ongoing two-and-a-half-year Russia-Ukraine war. He believes \"this is a war that should never have started.\" The Republican presidential candidate is considering reaching an agreement with Russian President Putin to decide which countries can join NATO, especially Ukraine and Georgia. This will have a significant impact on NATO's vague commitment to Ukraine's future, which the Biden administration is implementing, but this commitment has no timetable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAccording to a national security expert familiar with Trump's thinking who wished to remain anonymous, Trump \"is open to stopping NATO expansion and will not return to Ukraine's 1991 borders. This will be on the table. But this does not mean giving up any other possibilities, including providing substantial weapons to Ukraine.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNATO is Preparing a Plan B for Ukraine\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn July 1, the Wall Street Journal quoted unnamed U.S. and NATO allied officials as saying that during the summit held in Washington, D.C., from July 9 to July 11, NATO will announce several new measures to respond to the impact of Trump's return to the White House on NATO's support for Ukraine policy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe report stated that NATO is planning new measures to protect support for Ukraine. This plan has been underway for several months and is accelerating due to Biden's poor performance in the first U.S. presidential election debate. NATO's measures include sending a new senior civilian official to Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, and establishing a new military command in Wiesbaden, western Germany, to coordinate military aid and training for the Ukrainian army from NATO member countries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe new military command in Wiesbaden is called \"NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine,\" consisting of about 700 U.S. and allied personnel from all NATO member countries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTrump has hardly concealed his disappointment with NATO allies, repeatedly criticizing them for taking advantage of U.S. security assistance in Europe and not fulfilling the NATO defense budget (2% of GDP) commitment. In 2014, NATO member countries agreed to spend 2% of GDP on defense budgets, but many countries have failed to achieve this goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReuters reported that in recent years, NATO allies' defense budgets have caused significant controversy, especially with former U.S. President Trump criticizing European allies for spending too little on their own national security and relying on U.S. protection. Earlier this year, U.S. Republican presidential candidate Trump hinted that he would not protect NATO allies whose defense budgets are less than 2% of GDP.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn June 17, NATO Secretary-General Stoltenberg said during a meeting with U.S. President Biden at the White House that five years ago, fewer than ten NATO allies achieved the goal of a defense budget of at least 2% of GDP. He emphasized how NATO allies have increased their continuous military spending since Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStoltenberg said, \"In Europe and Canada, NATO allies' defense budget increase this year is 18%, the largest increase in decades. Twenty-three allies will have a defense budget of 2% of GDP or higher this year.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNATO Secretary-General Stoltenberg stated that when NATO leaders set the goal of a defense budget of 2% of GDP at the 2014 summit, only three allies, the U.S., Greece, and the UK, achieved this goal. At that time, NATO had 28 allies, now it has increased to 32 allies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEarlier, Stoltenberg said in a speech at the Wilson Center think tank that NATO allies increasing defense spending \"is beneficial for both Europe and the U.S., especially since most of this additional funding is spent in the U.S.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNATO is Negotiating Nuclear Weapons Deployment\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe UK's Daily Telegraph reported in June that NATO Secretary-General Stoltenberg said in an interview with the media that in the face of increasing threats from Moscow and Beijing, NATO is negotiating the deployment of more nuclear weapons and keeping them on standby.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStoltenberg said, \"I will not discuss in detail how many nuclear warheads should be available and which nuclear warheads should be stored, but we need to consult on these nuclear weapons issues.

I can do it, and I can do it within 24 hours.\" Trump added that this could be achieved as long as he met with the presidents of both countries, Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Since then, Trump has repeatedly made this campaign promise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring the first debate of the 2024 presidential election last Thursday (June 27), Trump once again asserted that if he were elected the next U.S. president, \"I will resolve the war between Putin and Zelenskyy before taking office on January 20,\" and \"I will quickly solve this issue before I take office.\" Trump also mocked Joe Biden, saying that if the U.S. had a \"real\" president who was respected by Putin, Russia would not have invaded Ukraine in February 2022.

Nebenzia criticized Zelenskyy's recent promotion of a so-called peace plan as \"a joke,\" saying it is unworkable and that Zelenskyy must \"realistically\" consider the situation since April this year. Nebenzia warned that the more difficult the situation in Ukraine becomes, the harder it will be to end the war through diplomatic means.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn June, Switzerland hosted a peace conference on the Russia-Ukraine war, where nearly 80 countries called for the end-of-war agreement to be based on Ukraine's \"territorial integrity.\" However, many developing countries did not attend the conference, and one of the main parties to the conflict, Russia, was also absent. Nebenzia said that on June 15, Putin had stated that if Kyiv were willing to withdraw from the occupied areas in the four eastern and southern regions of Ukraine and abandon its bid to join NATO, Russia would immediately cease fire and begin negotiations.

Zelensky Pleads with Putin, NATO Chief Blames China\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe United States and NATO orchestrated the Russia-Ukraine conflict with the intention of using the war to destroy Russia, thereby allowing them to focus on their next adversary\u2014China. However, things did not go as planned. Not only did Russia not collapse, but it has also grown stronger through the conflict, currently holding the initiative in the war and nearing victory. In this context, NATO has shifted its anger towards China, accusing it of being the instigator of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which is utterly absurd. What exactly is going on here?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, Zelensky is considering negotiating with Russia!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently, Ukrainian President Zelensky stated in an interview with Western media that negotiations with Russia could be achieved through third-party mediation. He cited the \"Black Sea Grain Corridor\" agreement, which was signed with Russia under the mediation of the United Nations and Turkey. Future third-party mediators for negotiations with Russia could include the United States and Western European countries, as well as nations from Asia, Africa, and Latin America.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePreviously, Zelensky had adamantly declared that as long as Putin remained in power, there would be no negotiations. So why the sudden 180-degree shift in attitude? The reason is not hard to understand: Russia has gained the upper hand on the Eastern Ukrainian battlefield. For instance, in the Kharkiv and Donetsk directions, the casualty ratio between Russian and Ukrainian forces is 1:6. Additionally, the \"Patriot\" missile defense system has proven ineffective against Russian guided and glide bombs, and its operational costs are exorbitant.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut that's not the worst of it. In the past day alone, the Ukrainian military lost 2,025 soldiers. At this rate of attrition, 20,000 Ukrainian soldiers could be dead in just ten days. For the Ukrainian military, which is already severely lacking in manpower and weaponry, this is a devastating blow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eZelensky's ultimate goal in leading the Ukrainian military to resist the Russian forces is to preserve his political position and his billions of dollars in wealth. Therefore, there is no need to fight Russia to the death. Moreover, his presidential term has long expired, and domestic opposition is significant, prompting Zelensky to consider self-preservation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFurthermore, Russia has not closed the door to negotiations. Putin has repeatedly emphasized that negotiations with Ukraine can start at any time. Thus, Zelensky feels that the time has come to negotiate with Russia and withdraw safely. What Zelensky needs to do now is create an opportunity for the U.S. and Russia to engage in negotiations, allowing them to discuss how to end the war, thereby avoiding the blame for war crimes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecondly, as Russia and Ukraine are about to start negotiations, NATO is getting anxious. NATO Secretary-General Stoltenberg has accused China of inciting the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently, NATO Secretary-General Stoltenberg told Japanese media that China \"incited the Russia-Ukraine war\" and claimed that China is a significant supporter of Russia's continued combat efforts. Without any evidence, Stoltenberg's baseless accusations against China clearly indicate that NATO views China as its next adversary.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my opinion, this reflects a subconscious mindset, suggesting that NATO has long discussed how to deal with China while handling Russia and has already developed contingency plans. Stoltenberg stated that NATO plans to cooperate with Asia-Pacific countries like Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand to counter China, which would help maintain the international order led by the U.S. and the West.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese contingency plans serve two purposes: to highlight the superiority of the U.S. and the West and to bolster NATO's confidence in confronting China.

In the direction of Kharkiv Vovchansk, Ukrainian forces continued to advance northward and continued airstrikes on Russian positions and concentration areas. Due to heavy casualties, soldiers of Russia's 153rd Anti-Tank Artillery Regiment and the Chechen Akhmat Battalion mutinied, refusing to carry out attack orders.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy did the Chechen supervision troops, who are supposed to oversee combat, mutiny?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDue to unfavorable war conditions, Russian soldiers fighting north of Kharkiv were extremely war-weary. The 7th Motorized Infantry Regiment and the 128th Motorized Rifle Brigade had the most severe desertion issues, with over 500 soldiers deserting at one time. These were also the first two units to be decimated by Ukrainian forces.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo curb this phenomenon, the Russian army set up three types of supervision troops: accompanying supervision troops, general supervision troops, and drone electronic supervision troops. Chechens have always served as accompanying supervision troops, with the authority to intercept and shoot deserters on the battlefield.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the night of June 29, several elite Ukrainian assault battalions launched a night attack north of Vovchansk, catching the Russian forces off guard and causing them to flee in disarray. The only unit that held its ground, the elite 83rd Air Assault Brigade, was overwhelmed and chose to retreat to defensive positions 3 kilometers from the border.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a result, the Chechen supervision troops, the Chechen Akhmat Special Forces, and the Chechen 153rd Anti-Tank Artillery Regiment, originally serving as rear guards, suddenly found themselves at the front. Due to the chaotic battlefield and inability to regroup the scattered troops, Russian field commanders ordered the Chechen units to resist in place and await reinforcements.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Chechens, who were more interested in making TikTok videos and looting washing machines, refused to engage in real combat. The three Chechen units collectively mutinied, refusing to carry out combat orders.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRussian media mostly claimed that the 83rd Guards Air Assault Brigade was decimated by Ukrainian forces, not deserters, while the deserters were from the 7th Motorized Infantry Regiment. This is understandable, as \"Guards\" units are considered elite, and having many deserters would be disgraceful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Russian army intended to establish a 10-kilometer-wide buffer zone along the border, but instead, the conflict spilled into their own territory. Unable to advance, the Russian army mobilized multiple units to reinforce the Kharkiv front, including the 155th Naval Infantry Brigade from the Pacific Fleet and the 24th Brigade from the 6th Army in St. Petersburg. However, this piecemeal reinforcement strategy met with greater failure. Ukrainian firepower became increasingly overwhelming, and without air superiority, the Russian forces were crushed in almost every aspect, with Ukrainian air and ground forces adding to the pressure. In such a battlefield situation, human wave tactics inevitably led to slaughter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith advantages in firepower, manpower, and mobility, Ukrainian forces used the encirclement of 400 Russian troops at a bone meal factory to lure and trap multiple Russian units. On June 30, the Ukrainian 25th Brigade destroyed a Russian female prisoner assault unit, capturing female prisoners for the first time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, apart from heavy aerial bombs, the Russian army has no effective offensive means left. The massive loss of equipment has forced Russia to bring out BTR-70 armored vehicles, T-62, and T-55 tanks, World War II-era ambulance motorcycles, scooters, and golf carts for attacks. Can such equipment compete with Leopard 2 and Bradley vehicles? No wonder there are mutinies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the past 24 hours, Ukrainian forces have engaged in firefights with encircled Russian troops, likely indicating Russian attempts to break out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**Avdiivka Frontline**\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the Avdiivka frontline, the Russian 506th Regiment's 2nd Battalion assault unit filmed a video complaining to their superiors:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"We were hit by 155mm artillery and cluster munitions. Everyone was left in the forest plantation. We were deceived. We were sent to be cannon fodder, and we were surrounded and defeated by the Ukrainians.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the past seven to eight months, although Russian human wave attacks achieved some tactical victories, the casualties were extremely high. For example, in the battle west of Avdiivka, the Russian 2nd Special Operations Battalion entered with 350 men, but only 4 survived.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**Defense Ministry High Official Defects, Top Secret Intelligence Leaked**\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few nights ago, a middle-aged, slightly overweight Russian woman hurriedly packed a suitcase \"filled with large amounts of cash\" and $1 billion worth of cryptocurrency, boarded a plane, and defected to Paris, France, seeking asylum. This woman is not an ordinary person; she is Tatiana Shevtsova, the former Deputy Minister of Defense of Russia and Shoigu's \"money bag.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis explosive news quickly spread among the Moscow high command, causing Putin to lose face: Shoigu's close deputy, Deputy Minister of Defense Shevtsova, had defected.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Kremlin has not officially responded to Shevtsova's defection, but the new Russian Defense Minister Belousov angrily called Shevtsova a \"parasite\" and a \"traitor to the nation.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShevtsova was once a favorite of Putin, or more accurately, Shoigu's favorite. She, like Putin and Medvedev, came from the \"St. Petersburg faction.\" Shevtsova, 55, graduated from St. Petersburg State University of Economics in 1991 with a Ph.D. in Economics. She rose through the ranks from a grassroots tax collector to Deputy Director of the Russian Tax Service in 2004, and then to Deputy Minister of Defense in 2010. In 2012, she was awarded the rank of General, despite having no military experience, at the age of 41, a meteoric rise that even Xi Jinping's favorite, Qin Gang, would envy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShevtsova is the highest-ranking female in the modern military rank system and holds the title of \"State Senior Advisor\" in Russia. This is something that even Peng Liyuan, who has sung praises for the Party for many years, cannot match, as she is only a Major General.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRussian military corruption is systemic, much like the Chinese military. During her nearly fourteen years in office, Shevtsova, who controlled the Defense Ministry's finances, was no exception. According to Forbes, Shevtsova amassed a fortune, owning luxury homes worth hundreds of millions of dollars in Moscow and expensive apartments, land, and luxury cars abroad. She allegedly transferred $1 billion worth of cryptocurrency, which is plausible given her role as \"financial director\" and her familiarity with complex financial processes. In peacetime, she was a major embezzler, and during wartime, she dared to profiteer from the national crisis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf all this is true, the consequences will be severe, dealing a heavy blow to Putin. The defection of a female general has caused panic in the Kremlin, as she holds numerous core secrets of Russia, including details of Russia's backers, secret procurement paths for dual-use products, Russia-China, Russia-North Korea, and Russia-Iran cooperation details, nuclear weapons funding, and Russian defense industry production and research. These are the top-secret intelligence NATO dreams of obtaining.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are rumors that the KGB has launched a \"cleanup operation\" against Shevtsova, but regardless of whether it proceeds, the leak of Russia's top military secrets is inevitable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStrictly speaking, Shevtsova was not Putin's confidant but Shoigu's, who served as Defense Minister for 12 years. On June 17, after Putin ordered the dismissal of four Deputy Defense Ministers, Shevtsova's position was taken by Putin's niece, Zivileva, who is a true confidant. As Putin's niece, Zivileva can make the president more at ease, exemplifying the principle of \"appointing the worthy without avoiding relatives.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIncidentally, Zivileva's husband is the current Russian Minister of Energy, and she herself runs a large coal company. Energy and coal are Russia's economic lifelines. What does this indicate?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt indicates that although Putin gained much praise for \"opposing financial oligarchs,\" the current Russian system still concentrates national resources in the hands of a few, much like the past.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlright, that's all for today's New Cold War Situation Room.

A series of new measures aimed at bolstering long-term support for Ukraine are expected to be announced at a summit in Washington next week. These measures are intended to support Ukraine's eventual prospect of joining the alliance without granting it membership. The backdrop for these measures includes the rise of far-right political forces in Europe, the increasing possibility of former President Trump returning to the White House, and the potential reduction of U.S. support for Ukraine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNATO will also establish a new command center in Wiesbaden, Germany, responsible for coordinating the provision of military equipment and training for Ukrainian forces. This operation, named \"NATO-Ukraine Security Assistance and Training,\" will consist of nearly 700 personnel from the 32-nation alliance, including the U.S. and other allied countries. This operation will take over most of the tasks that have been managed by U.S. forces since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. These new initiatives have been in the works for months, but they have gained new urgency following President Biden's poor performance in a televised debate with Trump on Thursday and Trump's complaints about the significant U.S. expenditure on Ukraine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIvo Daalder, who served as the U.S. Ambassador to NATO from 2009 to 2013, said, \"One important reason for this change is to ensure that aid to Ukraine is not affected by Trump.\" He noted, \"NATO will take over the management of training and assistance from Washington. Therefore, even if the U.S. reduces or withdraws its support for this work, it will not cancel the operation.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs far-right parties gain increasing voter support in France, the Netherlands, and across the EU, institutionalizing NATO's role may also make military aid to Ukraine less susceptible to policy fluctuations among allied countries. Douglas Lute, who served as the U.S. Ambassador to NATO from 2013 to 2017, said, \"In the face of potential national political changes, whether due to election results in the U.S., France, the UK, or the EU, NATO's role has lasting significance.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrent and former U.S. officials said these measures will enable NATO to better coordinate Western efforts to provide military support to Ukraine, which has become a prolonged test of wills between Moscow and Western countries at NATO's doorstep. The plan also aims to make the Ukrainian military more like NATO forces. All allied leaders will attend the NATO summit in Washington, where initiatives to support Ukraine will be a key focus. The founding treaty of NATO was signed in Washington 75 years ago, with the purpose of protecting its member states from threats from Moscow\u2014a mission NATO is once again undertaking.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNATO diplomats said that although the terms are still being negotiated, alliance members hope the Washington summit will also reach a consensus on financial commitments for annual military support to Ukraine. Recent discussions among alliance members have included setting a target of approximately $40 billion annually and increasing contributions from many allies, although the U.S. is likely to remain the primary donor to Ukraine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany allies have stated that NATO should invite Ukraine to join, initiating a process that could take years, but the U.S. and Germany oppose taking this step at next week's summit. Officials said that to mask internal divisions within NATO, the alliance is likely to describe Ukraine's application to join NATO as \"irreversible,\" whereas last year's NATO Vilnius summit communiqu\u00e9 stated that \"Ukraine's future is in NATO,\" and the 2008 summit communiqu\u00e9 said Ukraine would one day become a NATO member.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnder the initiatives that have been agreed upon and will be finalized at the Washington summit, staff from non-U.S. members will work alongside Americans at the new NATO Wiesbaden command center, adjusting military equipment donations and coordinating deliveries based on Ukraine's needs. They will also coordinate training for Ukrainian forces to ensure the provided equipment meets Kyiv's requirements.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOfficials said NATO staff themselves will not conduct any training. These changes aim to build institutional momentum and disseminate the logistical knowledge involved in transporting supplies from dozens of countries to Ukraine's borders. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said in Brussels last month that these changes will provide a \"more solid foundation\" for NATO's support for Ukraine \"in the coming years.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile this change will expand NATO's involvement, the U.S. will continue to provide most of the personnel, who will report to U.S. European Command Commander and NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe Christopher Cavoli. The senior NATO civilian official stationed in Kyiv will focus on Ukraine's long-term military modernization needs and non-military support, and will liaise with the planned Wiesbaden command center and NATO headquarters in Brussels. The new measures also signify an important shift in NATO's stance. The alliance initially kept its distance from military operations in Ukraine to avoid being accused of being a party to the conflict. The organizational changes mean NATO is now prepared to play a more significant role in helping Kyiv resist the Russian invasion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA senior U.S. State Department official said, \"Since NATO allies provide over 90% of the security assistance to Ukraine, NATO is naturally the place to coordinate assistance to ensure Ukraine is better able to defend itself now and in the future.\" The Washington summit comes at a critical moment in U.S. politics. Biden has highlighted his role in mobilizing NATO support for Ukraine as one of the main achievements of his foreign policy, and the White House has been seeking to help Ukraine resist Russian forces while limiting the risk of the conflict escalating into a direct U.S.-Russia confrontation. Biden has also stated that stopping Russian forces in Ukraine is crucial to preventing Moscow's aggression in other parts of Europe and beyond.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn last Thursday's televised debate, Biden said, \"I have the support of 50 other countries around the world for Ukraine, including Japan and South Korea. (History shows) any large-scale war in Europe cannot be confined to Europe alone.\" Trump, on the other hand, called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy \"the greatest salesman of all time\" for persuading the U.S. to provide massive military support to Kyiv and said the Russia-Ukraine war is a bigger security issue for European countries than for the U.S. \"because we have an ocean between us.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTrump also claimed he would negotiate a diplomatic agreement between Zelenskyy and Russian President Putin before being sworn in as president. Trump did not explain the terms of such a reconciliation but said Putin's demand for Moscow to retain the four occupied regions in eastern Ukraine while Ukraine abandons its application to join NATO is unacceptable. Trump said, \"I will resolve the war between Putin and Zelenskyy before I take office on January 20.\""],["**Day 860 of the Russia-Ukraine War (July 2, 2024): A Look at Ukraine's Attack on Crimea**\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn July 1, Ukrainian forces launched a missile attack on Sevastopol in Crimea.

Video footage shows at least one Su-27 aircraft destroyed and several others damaged.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Russian military claimed to have destroyed a Ukrainian F-16 fighter jet, but this appears to be an exaggeration. The aircraft hit was not an F-16 but an Su-27, and there was no large explosion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNormally, operational aircraft are fully fueled and ready for takeoff.

Without information support, when Russian air force jets arrive overhead, Ukrainian man-portable air-defense soldiers would not have time to prepare, possibly only getting ready after the planes have left. However, with NATO information support, it\u2019s different. NATO's early warning aircraft are on duty at the edge of the battlefield, and the takeoff, direction, and timing of Russian aircraft are transmitted in real-time to the air-defense soldiers, allowing them to ambush Russian planes frequently.

Of course, the Russian military is also changing, with notable performances from General Surovikin."],["On June 25, the war in Ukraine reached its 853rd day. Amid fierce battles along a front line stretching thousands of kilometers, Russia's new Defense Minister Belousov received an invitation to speak with U.S. Defense Secretary Austin. This invitation indicates that the call was initiated by the United States. The question then arises: why did the U.S. Defense Secretary take the initiative to make this call?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirstly, this serves to reassure the American public that the U.S. homeland is safe and there is no need to worry. The existence of a military hotline between Washington and Moscow has always been a symbol of peace between the two major military powers. However, before and during the early stages of the Russia-Ukraine war, the U.S. Defense Secretary could not get through to the Russian Defense Secretary, meaning the Russian Defense Secretary was not taking calls from his U.S. counterpart. The Pentagon, which has been in direct confrontation with the \"fighting nation\" for nearly 80 years, understands very well that if Moscow is unusually quiet, it likely means the Russian military is up to something. It is well known that \"unpredictability\" has always been one of the Russian military's soft powers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore than 20 years ago, when Russia was impoverished and weak, a 200-strong Russian airborne unit dared to make a long-range raid on the Kosovo airport, which was heavily surrounded by 7,000 NATO troops. Now, after more than two years of mobilization, 700,000 Russian troops are fighting fiercely in Ukraine, capable of any action. After all, the Russian military is known for either erupting in silence or perishing in silence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTherefore, the White House, which has been manipulating the Ukraine war from behind the scenes, and the Pentagon, deeply hated by the Russians, must provide the American people with a \"reassurance pill\": the Russian military is currently fighting well on the front lines and still has the mood to maintain a hotline with the Pentagon, exchanging some inconsequential pleasantries. This implies that U.S.-Russia relations are temporarily stable and controllable, and the war is confined to Europe, posing no threat to the U.S. homeland. In other words, the Russian military has not yet been driven to madness and is still negotiating with the U.S. military, not recklessly throwing \"big bombs.\" The U.S. homeland is currently safe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecondly, this serves to reassure European NATO member states that Russia still harbors illusions about conventional warfare, and they can continue to pressure the Russian military. Russia is fighting a proxy war in Ukraine against NATO and the U.S., whose conventional forces are several times larger. Russia's confidence naturally comes from its strategic nuclear forces. Once the war ends, it could either lead to peace or total destruction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, Russia is fighting the war in Ukraine to survive, not because it wants to perish. Therefore, problems that can be solved through conventional means should not be addressed with the most extreme measures. If conventional means can force the U.S. and NATO back to the 1997 boundaries without using \"big weapons,\" Moscow would be more than happy to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThus, the Russian military is deliberately extending the front line, inflicting \"a thousand cuts\" on the Ukrainian forces over thousands of kilometers. This not only considers leaving the land but not the people but also serves as a rehearsal for Russia's iron-blooded generation to kill Ukrainians and warn European countries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, Russia has over 2 million battle-hardened veterans from the Ukraine war. European countries must consider the cost of fighting these seasoned warriors if they wish to continue ganging up on Russia. As the scale and intensity of the Ukraine war increase, the Russian military fights more fiercely, and European countries' anxiety grows.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the NATO summit approaching and the need to set the tone for the next phase of operations, the U.S. Defense Secretary's move to probe the new Russian Defense Minister's intentions is a clear signal to reassure NATO and European member states. As long as the new Russian Defense Minister takes the call, it means Russia is still engaging with the U.S. and does not intend to attack the U.S. homeland directly. As long as Russia does not attack the U.S. homeland, European countries are not threatened by \"big bombs\" and can continue to encourage Ukraine to fight Russia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly, this serves to reassure the Ukrainian military that the U.S. military still has a deterrent effect on the Russian military, and they can continue to fight. Since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war, the U.S. and Russian Defense Ministers have had three phone calls. After each call, the military aid to Ukraine increased, and the losses suffered by the Russian military grew.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn May 13, 2022, U.S. Defense Secretary Austin invited Russian Defense Minister Shoigu for the first phone call since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war. At that time, the Russian military was advancing smoothly on the front lines after withdrawing from Kyiv, having captured Mariupol and preparing for the \"Severodonetsk-Lysychansk\" campaign. However, after the phone call, NATO immediately increased military aid to Ukraine, and the HIMARS rocket launchers appeared on the Ukrainian battlefield a month later. The Ukrainian military gradually emerged from the initial confusion of the war, and their long-range strikes against the Russian military completely changed the situation on the battlefield, disrupting the Russian military's plans for a quick victory and leading to a prolonged war of attrition.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn October 21, 2022, after the Ukrainian military's sudden autumn counteroffensive achieved significant results in the Kharkiv direction, the Russian military changed commanders, with General Surovikin stabilizing the Russian forces. Additionally, the partial mobilization of 300,000 veterans and the successful referendums in the four eastern Ukrainian regions to join Russia were completed. U.S. Defense Secretary Austin invited Russian Defense Minister Shoigu for the second phone call since the Russia-Ukraine conflict began. After probing the Russian military's intentions, the Ukrainian military recaptured Kherson within 20 days. On December 5, more than a month later, the Ukrainian military launched its first attack on the Engels airbase, where Russia's strategic bombers were deployed, marking the beginning of large-scale long-range attacks on Russian territory by the Ukrainian military.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn March 15, 2023, during the critical phase of the \"meat grinder\" battle in Bakhmut, U.S. Defense Secretary Austin invited Russian Defense Minister Shoigu for the third phone call since the Russia-Ukraine conflict began. Officially, the call was to discuss the downing of a U.S. \"Reaper\" drone by Russian fighter jets over the Black Sea, but it was actually to stabilize the Russian military's agitation and persuade Russia to continue taking hits on the Ukrainian battlefield. Three months later, the Ukrainian military not only launched a long-planned summer counteroffensive but also received approval from the U.S. to deploy Army Tactical Missile Systems with a range of over 300 kilometers in Ukraine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Ukraine war increasingly highlights the brutal head-to-head confrontation between the two sides. With the NATO summit imminent, the tone for NATO's operations against Russia in the second half of the year will be set. To secure more NATO military aid, the Ukrainian military is planning a major counteroffensive on the Kharkiv border, threatening Russian territory. They are also increasing long-range attacks on Crimea and Russian territory using U.S. missiles and rockets, even targeting beaches in Crimea. This level of aggression is unacceptable to the Russian military.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTherefore, to keep Russian retaliation within controllable limits, the U.S. Defense Secretary once again invited the Russian Defense Minister for a phone call. Hearing the voice of Russian Defense Minister Belousov on the other end of the line likely brought relief to the U.S. Defense Secretary. What Belousov said is less important; the fact that he picked up the phone indicates that the Russian military has not yet decided to erupt in silence."],["Just saw a big news story: Biden has decided to withdraw from the election.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI checked, and the source of this news comes from an \"exclusive report\" by BillOReilly News Headquarters, claiming that after discussions with family and close associates, Biden has decided to withdraw from the 2024 presidential election, and so on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is, of course, nonsense. In fact, the opposite is true: Biden has received unanimous support from his family and senior Democratic officials, making it impossible for him to withdraw. Moreover, I believe that unless Biden's health deteriorates significantly in the coming months, he will win this election.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason is simple: the American people do not like Biden, but they dislike Trump even more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have said this many times, most recently a few days ago in a short article published after the TV debate: \"Biden: So What If He Lost the Debate?\" At that time, I mentioned, \"This debate neither shakes Biden's staunch supporters nor easily sways middle voters towards Trump. As observers have noted, the only certainty after the debate is that the number of voters who dislike both candidates has increased.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd indeed, this is the case.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe latest survey by Ipsos (a global leading market research group) shows that American voters' views on Biden and Trump have hardly changed after the debate, with 46.7% of voters ready to vote for Biden and 43.9% supporting Trump.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, Biden could still lose this election, although the probability is relatively low.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause he is really too old and too sluggish. If he had a different opponent, he wouldn't stand a chance, as suggested by the classic cover of Time magazine after the TV debate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, what if Trump is elected?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, regarding the Russia-Ukraine war, I believe he will not let Russia win -- note, \"not let Russia win,\" not make Russia lose, which is the difference between him and Biden.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTrump stated in the TV debate, \"He does not accept Putin's conditions for ending the war, which include Russia retaining territorial claims and Ukraine giving up joining NATO.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don't think this is a lie.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut Trump is clearly unwilling to support Ukraine in the long term, that's for sure. Therefore, he is very likely to use his expertise in extreme pressure to make both sides take a step back: Ukraine will certainly have to cede some territory (though not as much as Putin demands), and Russia may have to accept Ukraine joining NATO.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWill Russia agree? I think they will.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI never believed that \"Ukraine not joining NATO\" is Putin's bottom line. Norway, Poland, the Baltic states, Finland, and Sweden are already at Russia's doorstep with NATO. As long as Trump offers a compromise on the occupied territories in Ukraine, Putin might very well take it. Because he knows that if Trump also firmly supports Ukraine, Russia will end up with nothing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd Ukraine?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can only say that Zelensky and his team (we'll talk about the public's reaction next time) will definitely not accept it; they will continue to fight with Europe's support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for the idea that \"Europe's hardliners will send troops to Ukraine before Trump takes office, creating a fait accompli of NATO's involvement,\" I think it's absolutely impossible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNeither Duda nor Macron would wave their hands and send troops to Ukraine to \"defend the homeland,\" because doing so would certainly face public opposition.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know saying this will upset friends who support Ukraine, but the fact is that apart from some idealists, no one would want to join such a brutal war.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere's no way around it; human nature is just like that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe failure of those utopias in human history was precisely because they refused to acknowledge the \"selfish\" side of human nature. The same principle applies to the Russia-Ukraine war; you can't just talk about morality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTherefore, I insist that unless Russian troops cross the Dnieper River and invade western Ukraine, posing a real threat to Europe, European countries will not send troops -- in fact, Macron's multiple speeches about sending troops express this very idea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for the Far East, whether it's Trump or Biden, the difference is only in tactics; the overall strategy will not change much. For the Far East, the variable lies in Europe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few days ago, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Kuleba told the special representative responsible for European affairs in the Far East, \"The importance of bilateral relations should be viewed strategically from the perspective of Ukraine's future accession to the European Union,\" which hits the nail on the head..."],["Today marks the 859th day of the Russia-Ukraine war. According to the latest data released by the Ukrainian General Staff, there were 117 battles across the front lines in the past 24 hours. The Russian military suffered the loss of 1,110 personnel, 19 tanks, 26 armored vehicles, and 66 artillery pieces.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, the overall situation on the Russia-Ukraine front has subtly changed. This change aligns with the roadmap following Western aid and follows the military dialectic of altering the balance of power by continuously depleting the enemy's war resources.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBattle Situation\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn Vovchansk, north of Kharkiv, following a nighttime offensive by Ukrainian forces on the 29th, another major attack was launched yesterday, forcing the main Russian forces to retreat towards the border.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, Russian forces in the Vovchansk battlefield north of Kharkiv have begun to retreat. The Liptsy battlefield is still fiercely contested, but Ukrainian forces have gained a significant advantage, and the difficulties faced by Russian forces are increasing. The first issue is supply. Ukrainian forces have continuously targeted Russian troop concentrations, military equipment, and supply lines in the border areas, severely weakening Russian logistics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe second issue is morale. The massive casualties caused by human wave assaults and meat-grinder tactics have led to widespread desertion and surrender among Russian troops. During yesterday's Ukrainian offensive, there were numerous reports of Chechen supervisory units and the Russian troops they were overseeing refusing to fight.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMilitary blogger Ilyichlov stated, \"The Ukrainian army has accelerated its offensive on Vovchansk, attempting to achieve victory through encirclement. Such a tactical outcome is challenging. While the Ukrainian forces might be able to drive the Russian army out of Kharkiv for the second time, achieving a decisive victory is difficult because the area is near the border, and Russian forces can retreat to their homeland at any time.\" We believe this assessment is objective.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSouthern Front\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn Kreminna on the eastern front, we reported yesterday that the 12th Special Operations Brigade, the 95th Air Assault Brigade, and the 13th Rifle Brigade of the Ukrainian army jointly expelled Russian forces from the Serebriansky Forest area. Yesterday afternoon, the 46th Brigade of the Ukrainian army launched a counterattack in Terny to the west of Kreminna and Yampolivka to the south, reclaiming 6.4 square kilometers of territory from Russian forces.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe green areas below represent the Russian positions in the Serebriansky Forest, with arrows indicating the reclaimed areas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn Chasiv Yar near Bakhmut, Ukrainian forces continued to push back after defeating the Russian 425th Assault Battalion yesterday, making progress both west of the canal and in the southern plantation area, thereby solidifying the Chasiv Yar defensive line.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis battlefield had previously been the most pressured area for Ukrainian forces. The Russian Ministry of Defense had ordered Russian forces in this area to capture Chasiv Yar by May 9. The Russian 76th Guards Air Assault Division and Storm Z units, supported by glide bombs, had been launching frenzied attacks. However, after prolonged attrition, the offensive momentum of the Russian forces has significantly weakened.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeyond the Battlefield\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDespite Russia's two consecutive peace proposals on June 13 and June 25, both were rejected by Ukraine. Putin's peace terms required Ukrainian forces to withdraw from the four eastern Ukrainian regions and not join NATO. Such insincere conditions were clearly unacceptable to Ukraine. Not only did Ukraine reject them, but even Russian citizens found them unrealistic. Russian netizen Sergey Yakov stated, \"This is not a peace proposal; it's a declaration to continue the war.\" Kozlov mocked, \"With the prospects of the special military operation looking increasingly bleak, what constructive value do such conditions have?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRussian Telegram channels reported today that the Crimean Bridge was suspected of being hit by a missile, with a massive explosion shocking residents and multiple ambulances rushing to the scene. There are claims that this was the first success of a Ukrainian F-16, although this has not been confirmed. However, the news of damage to critical parts of the Crimean Bridge has spread throughout Moscow, and the grief on Telegram might be the best proof.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAccording to the Kyiv Post on the 30th, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n announced that he would visit Ukraine next week to improve bilateral relations. Hungary, a member of the EU and NATO, has consistently maintained close ties with Russia, refusing to aid Ukraine and frequently exercising veto power on aid issues, much to the frustration of other EU countries. After facing collective resistance from member states and sanctions from the EU, Hungary has recently moderated its stance and begun supporting Ukraine's EU accession talks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe latest Gallup poll results show that Putin's approval rating among young Russians has dropped from a previous high of 85% to the current 15%. The All-Russian Public Opinion Research Center reported that Putin's approval rating is now only 31%. Meanwhile, support for Putin among ethnic Russians in four neighboring countries has also significantly declined. Support among Armenians dropped from 45% to 26%, among Kazakhs from 55% to 29%, among Armenians from 45% to 32%, and in Kyrgyzstan, it fell by 15 percentage points. Baidu AI's answer to Putin's approval rating dropping to 15% is:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRussian media reported that a Y-20A military transport aircraft from a neighboring country landed in Moscow yesterday. Its purpose is unknown, but it has caused unease during these turbulent times.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMeanwhile, the Russian-Indian joint military-industrial enterprise delivered the first set of BrahMos anti-ship missiles to the Philippines. Manufacturer Alexander Maksichev stated in response to questions about the delivery to Manila, \"We have completed the supply of three combat units and trained Filipino personnel. This is just the initial stage of the transaction, and we will continue to deliver more missiles to the Philippines.\" Vasily Kashin, a senior researcher at the Higher School of Economics in Russia, said in an interview, \"The BrahMos is produced in India and is a licensed version of the Russian Oniks anti-ship missile.

I'm Yuanshan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday is July 1, 2024, marking the 859th day of the Russia-Ukraine war. On June 30, Ukraine launched missile and drone attacks on Dzhankoi, Sevastopol, and Simferopol in Crimea. Simultaneously, six Russian states were attacked by dozens of drones, a situation that has become routine in Russia. According to Russian media reports, Russian air defense systems shot down 36 Ukrainian drones.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMeanwhile, Ukraine continues to target Russian air defense systems, radars, refineries, oil depots, and supply lines, aiming to cripple Russia's energy economy and weaken its war efforts from the source.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**Ukraine's Successful Partial Counterattack: 30,000 Russian Troops Trapped**\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the battlefield, Ukraine continues to eliminate Russian troops and equipment. The Russian military has even resorted to using refurbished World War II motorcycles, indicating severe equipment losses. Ukraine's ongoing war of attrition is putting Russia in a difficult position, and this pressure may soon reach a critical point.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the Kharkiv region, Ukrainian forces launched counterattacks on Hlyboke, Starytsia, and Vovchansk. The Institute for the Study of War reports that the situation in northern Kharkiv has stabilized.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter several Russian brigades collapsed, additional reinforcements were sent to Kharkiv to try to consolidate minor gains, but the reality is harsh, and the Russian military is struggling to maintain the fight there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAccording to Forbes, the Russian military attempted to capture Vovchansk but, after a bitter struggle, approximately 30,000 Russian troops are now trapped there. The report suggests that the Russian military has likely lost the strength of an entire brigade.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, Ukrainian forces defeated the elite Russian 83rd Airborne Brigade in Vovchansk. Notably, many Russian soldiers there refused to continue fighting. Another significant achievement is that since the full-scale invasion began, Ukraine has shot down a staggering 686 Russian aircraft and helicopters, including the latest Su-25.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecent geographical footage shows Ukrainian troops advancing along Heroiv Khornobylia Street. Russian media claims that remnants of the Russian 83rd Brigade are fleeing. It remains to be seen if the Ukrainian 82nd Brigade can intercept them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the Zaporizhzhia region, on June 29, an Iskander-M missile struck a Ukrainian convoy 50 kilometers from the front line, causing significant losses. Russian sources claim they destroyed Ukrainian M113s, BUK-M1s, BMP-1s, and trucks. It is unclear what system the Russian military used for the attack.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the Avdiivka front, Russia nearly controls the entire Sokil and continues to advance along the Novoleksandrivka-Sokil-Umansk line, attempting to level the front line, but progress is slower than earlier this year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn June 30, Ukraine released data showing continued high Russian personnel and equipment losses, though the intensity has decreased compared to previous periods.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eObservers have noted that in the past six months, due to a lack of air defense missiles, Ukrainians have resorted to various methods to defend their skies, including using and upgrading 40-year-old Yak-52 propeller planes, which have recently achieved some success.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn June 29, a Yak-52 reportedly confronted a Russian reconnaissance drone in the air and shot it down at close range with a shotgun. Although propeller planes are slower than jets, they are faster than drones, allowing the Yak-52 to catch up with the Russian Zala drone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**F-16s Possibly Engaged in First Combat in Ukraine: When Will Full Air Superiority Be Achieved?**\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn June 29, former Ukrainian Air Force pilot and air defense advisor Xavier Taitman announced on social media, confirmed by the International Legion, that the first batch of F-16 fighter jets had arrived in Ukraine and conducted their first attack.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDanish Royal Air Force Commander Major General Jan Dam recently stated that the plan to deliver F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine is expected to be completed on schedule. However, he emphasized that for operational security reasons, specific dates cannot be disclosed. He hopes the delivery will proceed as planned and will notify everyone when the jets are ready in Ukraine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePreviously, Denmark, Belgium, Norway, and the Netherlands had announced plans to deliver F-16s to Ukraine in June or summer. Given the recent destruction of Russian air defense systems in Crimea, including the S-500 system, and frequent bombings in Russia's Belgorod region using U.S.-made precision-guided bombs, there is reason to believe that F-16s may have already been deployed in combat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, the initial batch of F-16s received by Ukraine will not be large, estimated at 4 to 6 aircraft, due to Ukraine's logistical maintenance capabilities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince this war is essentially a confrontation between the entire West and Russia, and despite Russian weapons not being as powerful as advertised, the presence of nuclear weapons has led the West to impose self-restraint in aiding Ukraine. Therefore, the number of F-16s provided by the West is indeed limited, only gradually improving Ukraine's air defense capabilities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany imagine that the arrival of F-16s will immediately change the battlefield situation, but this may not happen because the initial batch of F-16s is insufficient to create an overwhelming military advantage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMajor General Jan Dam also stated that even if Ukraine receives F-16 fighter jets, it will still be unable to fully control its airspace. He pointed out, \"Ukraine has a lot of work to do to gain air superiority. They need more effective air and ground defense forces.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn other words, while F-16s can help Ukraine gain partial air superiority and intercept Russian missiles and drones, Ukraine still needs to further eliminate Russian air defense systems and use Patriot systems to protect F-16 bases. Currently, Ukraine is using HIMARS to launch ATACMS missiles for such tasks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is estimated that after receiving the F-16s, Ukraine will first try to clear air defense systems on the front lines and in Crimea by launching precision glide bombs from a distance and using air-to-air missiles to intercept Russian missiles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, the limited number of pilots and slow training progress are challenges Ukraine faces. The shortage of ground crew is also a problem, though less known. In fact, training experienced ground crew takes much longer than training pilots. Of course, it is possible that the West will provide corresponding support services to address this shortfall.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome analysts believe that the first pilots to fly Ukraine's F-16s may not be Ukrainian pilots trained by the West but rather F-16 pilots from the International Legion. Previously, many former U.S. F-16 pilots expressed their willingness to fly F-16s for Ukraine in combat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegarding the defensive capabilities of the F-16, Major General Jan Dam stated, \"If an F-16 is shot down, it would be a significant strategic victory for Russia. We are doing our utmost to ensure Ukrainian pilots are proficient in operating the F-16 to minimize risks. But I cannot guarantee anything. Of course, if some are shot down, I would be very regretful.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIndeed, any weapon on the battlefield, including the F-35, is at risk of being shot down, let alone the F-16. Currently, Ukraine can only reduce the risk of F-16s being shot down through preliminary work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore importantly, the F-16 is just a combat platform, and its power depends on the weapon configuration provided by the Biden administration for Ukraine's F-16s. Additionally, for the F-16 to truly exert significant power, Swedish-provided early warning aircraft are also needed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile the F-16 is not a panacea, it plays a crucial role in the development of the situation. The F-16, combined with the Patriot air defense system, will effectively change the situation of Russian forces dropping FAB bombs. If it is confirmed that F-16s participated in the first combat, it will further deepen the impression that the current situation is favorable to Ukraine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**More Senior Russian Officials Wanted: Israel to Aid with 8 Patriot Systems**\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAccording to the latest news, the Financial Times reported that the United States, Israel, and Ukraine are discussing Israel's plan to provide up to eight Patriot air defense systems to Ukraine to help it resist Russian attacks. This aid requires the support of the Biden administration or equivalent military aid to Israel in exchange.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese M901 PAC-2 systems, deployed during the Gulf War, are older than the Patriot PAC-3 systems currently used by Ukraine. However, the PAC-2's advantage lies in its longer range, similar to how Ukraine's S-200 compares to the S-300, posing a greater threat to Russian Su-34s launching glide bombs. Most importantly, these Patriots can launch the intercept missiles currently provided by the United States to Ukraine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRussia's troubles do not end there. Last week, the International Criminal Court in The Hague issued arrest warrants for former Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Russian Army Chief of Staff Valery Gerasimov, accusing them of war crimes and crimes against humanity during the invasion of Ukraine. These senior officials are accused of participating in multiple crimes, including bombing Ukraine's civilian energy infrastructure. This move marks further legal accountability by the International Criminal Court for senior Russian officials, including other key figures leading the invasion alongside Russian President Putin. Although Russia is not a member of the International Criminal Court, these charges could have significant international repercussions, including travel restrictions and other sanctions against the accused individuals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlright, that's all for today's New Cold War Situation Room.

I'm Yuanshan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday is July 1, 2024, marking the 859th day of the Russia-Ukraine war. On June 30, Ukraine launched missile and drone attacks on Dzhankoi, Sevastopol, and Simferopol in Crimea. Simultaneously, dozens of drones attacked six Russian states, a situation that has become routine in Russia. According to Russian media, Russia's air defense systems shot down 36 Ukrainian drones.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMeanwhile, Ukraine continues to target Russian air defense systems, radars, refineries, oil depots, and supply lines, aiming to cripple Russia's energy economy and weaken its war efforts from the source.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**Ukraine's Successful Partial Counterattack: 30,000 Russian Troops Trapped**\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the battlefield, Ukraine continues to eliminate Russian troops and equipment. The Russian military has even resorted to using refurbished World War II motorcycles, indicating severe equipment losses. Ukraine's war of attrition is putting Russia in a difficult position, and this pressure may soon reach a tipping point.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the Kharkiv region, Ukrainian forces launched counterattacks on Hlyboke, Starytsia, and Vovchansk. The Institute for the Study of War reports that the situation north of Kharkiv has stabilized.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter several Russian brigades collapsed, Russia continued to send reinforcements to Kharkiv, trying to consolidate minor gains, but the reality is harsh, and the Russian military struggles to maintain the fight there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAccording to Forbes, Russian forces attempted to capture Vovchansk but, after a bitter struggle, about 30,000 Russian troops are now trapped there. The report suggests that Russia may have lost an entire brigade's worth of strength.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, Ukrainian forces defeated Russia's elite 83rd Airborne Brigade in Vovchansk. Notably, many Russian soldiers there refused to continue fighting. Another significant achievement is that since the full-scale invasion began, Ukraine has shot down a staggering 686 Russian aircraft and helicopters, including a recent Su-25.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLatest geographical footage shows Ukrainian troops advancing along Heroiv Khornobylia Street. Russian media claims that remnants of the 83rd Brigade are fleeing, and it remains to be seen if Ukraine's 82nd Brigade can intercept them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the Zaporizhzhia region, on the 29th, an Iskander-M missile hit a Ukrainian convoy 50 kilometers from the front line, causing significant losses. Russian sources claim they destroyed Ukrainian M113s, BUK-M1s, BMP-1s, and trucks. It is unclear what system the Russian military used for the attack.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the Avdiivka front, Russia nearly controls the entire Sokil and continues to advance along the Novoleksandrivka-Sokil-Umansk line, trying to level the front line, but progress is slower than earlier this year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn June 30, Ukraine released data showing continued high Russian personnel and equipment losses, though the intensity has decreased compared to previous periods.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the past six months, due to a lack of air defense missiles, Ukrainians have resorted to various methods to defend their skies, including using and improving 40-year-old propeller planes like the Yak-52, which recently had some success.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn June 29, a Yak-52 reportedly confronted a Russian reconnaissance drone in the air and shot it down at close range with a shotgun. Although propeller planes are slower than jets, they are faster than drones, allowing the Yak-52 to catch up with the Russian Zala drone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**F-16s May Have Seen First Combat in Ukraine: When Will Full Air Superiority Be Achieved?**\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn June 29, former Ukrainian Air Force pilot and air defense advisor Xavier Taitman announced on social media that the first batch of F-16 fighter jets had arrived in Ukraine and conducted their first attack, confirmed by the International Legion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDanish Royal Air Force Commander Major General Jan Dam recently stated that the plan to deliver F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine is expected to be completed on schedule. However, he emphasized that for operational security reasons, specific dates could not be disclosed but hoped to deliver as planned. When the fighter jets are ready in Ukraine, everyone will be informed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePreviously, Denmark, Belgium, Norway, and the Netherlands had stated they would deliver F-16s to Ukraine in June or summer. Given the recent destruction of Russian air defense systems in Crimea, including the S-500 system, and frequent bombings in Russia's Belgorod region using U.S.-made precision-guided bombs, there is reason to believe that F-16s may already be in combat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, the initial batch of F-16s received by Ukraine will not be large, estimated at 4 to 6 aircraft, related to Ukraine's logistical maintenance capabilities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince this war is essentially a confrontation between the entire West and Russia, although Russian weapons are not as powerful as their published data suggests, the presence of nuclear weapons has led the West to set self-imposed red lines in aiding Ukraine. Therefore, the number of F-16s provided by the West is indeed limited, only gradually improving Ukraine's air defense capabilities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany imagine that the arrival of F-16s will immediately change the battlefield situation, but this may not happen because the initial number of F-16s received by Ukraine is insufficient to form an overwhelming military advantage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMajor General Jan Dam also stated that even if Ukraine receives F-16 fighter jets, it will still be unable to fully control its airspace. He pointed out: \"Ukraine has a lot of work to do to gain air superiority. They need more effective air and ground air defense forces.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn other words, while F-16s can help Ukraine gain partial air superiority and intercept Russian missiles and drones, Ukraine still needs to further eliminate Russian air defense systems and use Patriot systems to protect F-16 bases. Currently, Ukraine is using HIMARS to launch ATACMS missiles for such tasks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is estimated that after receiving the F-16s, Ukraine will first try to clear front-line and Crimean air defense systems by launching precision glide bombs from a distance and using air-to-air missiles to intercept Russian missiles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, the limited number of pilots and slow training progress are challenges Ukraine faces. The shortage of ground crew is also a problem, though less known. In fact, training experienced ground crew takes much longer than training pilots. However, it is possible that the West may provide corresponding support services to fill this gap.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome analysts believe that the first pilots flying Ukraine's F-16s may not be Ukrainian pilots trained by the West but rather F-16 pilots from the International Legion. Previously, many former U.S. F-16 pilots expressed their willingness to fly F-16s for Ukraine in combat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegarding the defensive capabilities of the F-16, Major General Jan Dam stated: \"If an F-16 is shot down, it would be a significant strategic victory for Russia. We are doing our best to ensure Ukrainian pilots are proficient in operating the F-16 to minimize risks. But I can't guarantee anything. Of course, if some are shot down, I would be very sorry.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIndeed, any weapon on the battlefield, including the F-35, is at risk of being shot down, let alone the F-16. Currently, Ukraine can only reduce the risk of F-16s being shot down through preliminary work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore importantly, the F-16 is just a combat platform, and its power depends on the weapon configuration provided by the Biden administration for Ukraine's F-16s. Additionally, for the F-16 to truly exert significant power, it needs the Swedish-provided early warning aircraft to be in place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile the F-16 is not omnipotent, it plays a crucial role in the development of the situation. The F-16, combined with the Patriot air defense system, will effectively change the situation of Russian forces dropping FAB bombs. If confirmed that F-16s participated in the first combat, it will further deepen the impression that the current situation favors Ukraine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**More Senior Russian Officials Wanted: Israel to Aid with 8 Patriot Systems**\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLatest reports indicate that the Financial Times cited sources saying the U.S., Israel, and Ukraine are discussing Israel's plan to provide up to 8 Patriot air defense systems to Ukraine to help it resist Russian attacks. This aid requires support from the Biden administration or equivalent military aid to Israel in exchange.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese M901 PAC-2 systems, deployed during the Gulf War, are older than the Patriot PAC-3 systems currently used by Ukraine. However, the PAC-2's advantage lies in its longer range, similar to how Ukraine's S-200 compares to the S-300, posing a greater threat to Russian Su-34s launching glide bombs. Most importantly, these Patriots can launch the intercept missiles currently provided by the U.S. to Ukraine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRussia's troubles don't end there. Last week, the International Criminal Court in The Hague issued arrest warrants for former Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Russian Army Chief of Staff Valery Gerasimov, accusing them of war crimes and crimes against humanity during the invasion of Ukraine. These senior officials are accused of participating in multiple crimes, including bombing Ukraine's civilian energy infrastructure. This move marks further legal accountability by the International Criminal Court for senior Russian officials, including other key figures leading the invasion alongside Russian President Putin. Although Russia is not a member of the International Criminal Court, these charges could have significant international repercussions, including travel restrictions and other sanctions against the accused.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlright, that's all for today's New Cold War Situation Room.
