    "promtp": "You are an expert in news analysis and skilled at creating multiple-choice question answers that help to differentiate topics between articles. 
    I have article summary and I need to generate unique, comprehensive multiple-choice questions based on these summaries.
    
    Your task is to generate questions and answers both in Chinese that:
    - Help to differentiate topics between the articles.
    - Are common to all articles, not specific to any one article.
    - Are unique and not repeated in any other batch.
    - Include "None of the above" as one of the options for each question.
    
    Below is the format and example I need:
    
    1. What was done?
       - A. The Chinese coast guard seized one of four food packs dropped by a Philippine military plane for Filipino navy personnel at a territorial outpost. After discovering the package contained food, they dumped it into the sea.
       - B. Philippine soldiers were reported to have pointed guns at Chinese coast guard personnel during a resupply mission to the grounded Sierra Madre ship. The Chinese coast guard responded to the resupply operation, which included food drops, by observing armed Philippine soldiers on the ship’s deck.
       - C. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan began a trip to China and expressed priorities to support Hamas against Israel and increase trade with China, without condemning the Uyghur genocide.
       - D. The Philippines is collaborating with the United States and Japan to ensure the West Philippine Sea (WPS) remains free and safe amid tensions with Chinese maritime forces.
       - E. None of the above
