       "  'body': 'Pham Van Coung, a director of Pho Noi Power Station, works at the Pho Noi Power Station, a state utility owned by Electricity of Vietnam, in Hung Yen province, Vietnam, on June 4, 2024. Reuters\\n\\nLights are off and air conditioning is down at the headquarters of Vietnam\\'s state-run electricity provider EVN as the country\\'s top power utility tries to \"lead by example\" to avoid a repeat of last year\\'s crippling blackouts, an official tells visitors. But many businesses around Vietnam\\'s capital Hanoi appear to be ignoring the call to conserve power, keeping decorative but otherwise purposeless neon lights on the outside of high-rise buildings on all night. The difficulties in curtailing consumption illustrate the challenges facing Vietnam a year after sudden outages caused losses of hundreds of millions of dollars to multinational manufacturers with investments in the Southeast Asian country.\\n\\nVietnam is pursuing a patchwork agenda of energy-saving measures, grid upgrades, regulatory reforms and a massive increase of coal power as it seeks to avert electricity shortfalls, according to government data and interviews with officials and experts. But Trinh Mai Phuong, EVN\\'s communications director, explains during a media visit that even the biggest infrastructure upgrade underway, a new $1 billion transmission line connecting the centre of the country to the highly industrialised north that was hard hit by blackouts last year, may not be enough.\\n\\n\"I would not say it is a game changer,\" Phuong said of the line that could be completed as early as this month, noting\\n\\nit is one of many measures needed amid multiple issues to address. Power consumption for instance is expected to hit record highs in the coming weeks as the country braces for more heatwaves, he said.\\n\\nThe soaring power demand is making it increasingly difficult for Vietnam to meet climate change commitments while providing enough power to satisfy large investors such as Samsung Electronics, Foxconn and Canon.\\n\\nBroader sector-wide reforms are needed over the longer term, foreign investors and analysts said.\\n\\nIn the short term, Vietnam is banking mostly on coal to provide enough reliable electricity. It may be just enough - or not - but either way it may signal a blow to the country\\'s commitments to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.\\n\\nCoal use rose massively in the first five months of 2024, with coal-fired power plants accounting on average for 59% of electricity output, exceeding 70% some days, according to EVN data.\\n\\nThat was up from nearly 45% in the same period last year and 41% in 2021, when Vietnam began drafting plans to cut coal that persuaded international donors to commit $15.5 billion to help phase out the fuel.\\n\\nThanks to a new coal-fired power plant that came online in 2023, coal accounted for 33% of total installed capacity last year, up from 30.8% in 2020, taking Vietnam further away from the goal of lowering that to 20% by 2030.\\n\\nEnergy conservation is another key pillar of the plan. EVN and its local units have encouraged energy-hungry clients, including foreign manufacturers, to save power with tailored measures, especially in peak hours.\\n\\nBut that risks Vietnam\\'s reputation as a reliable place for investment and could affect future manufacturing expansion plans, according to foreign investors who declined to be named because they were not authorised to talk to media.\\n\\nThe matter should be addressed by solving generation and distribution issues, and not from the consumption side, two foreign investors said.\\n\\nVietnam\\'s industry ministry did not reply to a request for comment. Vietnam is using only a fraction of its installed solar and onshore wind capacity due largely to administrative hurdles.\\n\\nIt has not approved regulations to kick-start offshore wind projects and delays dog projects to build power plants fuelled by imported liquefied natural gas, which is cleaner than coal. The four energy sources together should account for more than 40% of installed capacity by 2030, according to the government\\'s plans, though analysts are sceptical. Hydropower is projected to fall to less than 20% of installed power generation by the end of decade from more than 30% in 2020.\\n\\nBut some capacity is being added in the north where needs are higher.\\n\\nOne of Vietnam\\'s largest hydropower plants at Hoa Binh is adding two General Electric turbines to its existing eight, which will boost its total capacity to 2.4 gigawatts from less than 2 GW now by the second half of 2025, said Dao Trong Sang, EVN\\'s manager of the expansion project, during a visit to the dam. The Hoa Binh plant, combined with the new transmission line that brings electricity to the north from separate plants, may add 8% capacity to the power-hungry north.\\n\\nThe power crisis cannot be solved without long-awaited reforms, experts say, though progress to date has been slow.\\n\\nIn April, the industry ministry issued an updated methodology for determining electricity prices, a step towards possibly reviving projects stuck for years because of a lack of clarity about tariffs.\\n\\nHowever, the methodology could force developers to shoulder excessive risk, complicating their access to finance, said a Vietnam-based official who declined to be named because they were not authorised to talk to media. A separate draft decree enabling manufacturers to buy electricity directly from producers is seen as close to approval after years of internal debate, according to several analysts. The use of direct power purchase agreements (DPPAs) could make it easier for multinational companies to avoid higher tariffs on exports and boost the use of renewables to help them meet environmental, social and governance requirements.\\n\\nBut the DPPA rules need to be combined with other reforms, such as clearer provisions to directly connect factories to power-generation projects, the official said.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Vietnamese President To Lam on Tuesday told Chinese ambassador to Hanoi Xiong Bo it was important that maritime disputes were managed well and each country\\'s interests were respected, his office said in a statement. China is Vietnam\\'s largest trading partner, but the two Communist-ruled neighbours have been embroiled in a years-long maritime dispute in the South China Sea. Lam said at a meeting in Hanoi that the countries needed to respect each other\\'s legitimate interests, the statement said. The two sides need to \"actively seek satisfactory solutions in accordance with international law,\" Lam said in the meeting. On Thursday, the foreign ministry had said it was deeply concerned over the presence of a Chinese survey vessel in Vietnam\\'s exclusive economic zone.\\n\\nIn Tuesday\\'s meeting, Lam said developing friendship and cooperation with China was Vietnam\\'s strategic choice and a priority in its foreign policies. Vietnam and China signed dozens of cooperation agreements, including on railways, during a visit to Hanoi by Chinese President Xi Jinping in December. Lam reiterated the need to boost railway connectivity between the two countries in the meeting, and asked China to further open its market for Vietnamese farm products.',\n",

       "  'body': 'McGill University provides funding as a member of The Conversation CA-FR.\\n\\nTaiwan recently saw yet another peaceful transition of power with the inauguration of President Lai Ching-Te, who was elected to office in January.\\n\\nIn his inaugural speech, Lai called on neighbouring China to cease its acts of intimidation and to \"choose dialogue over confrontation.\"\\n\\nChina responded by launching a simulated blockade of Taiwan. The People\\'s Liberation Army released images boasting its ability to rain missiles on one of the most densely populated countries in the world as \"strong punishment.\"\\n\\nDemocracy under threat\\n\\nBeijing\\'s standard reaction to the democratic voting rights of 24 million people is to threaten to \"break skulls and let blood flow.\" For China, Taiwan as a renegade province that must \"return to the embrace of the motherland\" despite the fact China does not have any authority over Taiwan.\\n\\nIn recent years, China has been trying to use its diplomatic clout and influence at the United Nations to rewrite history and legitimize its claim of sovereignty over Taiwan.\\n\\nWhile Taiwan ranks highly on the Human Freedom Index (just one spot ahead of Canada), China is a techno-authoritarian state that has regressed even further under the reign of Xi Jinping.\\n\\nMillions of Uyghur Muslims remain in re-education and forced labour camps, while Tibetans are forced to \"Sinicize\" and lose their cultural and religious heritage.\\n\\nReaching beyond borders\\n\\nPolitical dissidents, journalists and foreign nationals are not immune from intimidation or imprisonment.\\n\\nIn what has been termed transnational oppression, aided through Chinese so-called police stations operating with impunity overseas, the Chinese government targets and threatens Chinese nationals and critics of China wherever they are.\\n\\nRead more: New commission sheds light on how diaspora communities are impacted by foreign interference\\n\\nMany governments, including Canada\\'s, caution against travel to China and Hong Kong due to the \"risk of arbitrary enforcement\" of laws prohibiting activities or speech critical of the Chinese Communist Party.\\n\\nChina\\'s censorship, surveillance and arbitrary arrests are widespread, and such tactics and technologies are alarmingly being exported worldwide.\\n\\nWhile the Chinese government condemns the forced divestment of TikTok, the app -- together with Facebook, WhatsApp and Google -- are all banned within the great firewall of China.\\n\\nWar games\\n\\nWhen former United States House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in 2022, China conducted similar war games.\\n\\nRead more: Nancy Pelosi\\'s visit to Taiwan causes an ongoing Chinese tantrum in the Taiwan Strait\\n\\nIncursions by Chinese warships and fighters into Taiwan\\'s Air Defence Identification Zone are increasing in frequency. In addition, short of mounting an invasion, China is increasingly testing the waters by deploying its maritime militia to swarm islands under Taiwan\\'s control.\\n\\nKnown as \"grey-zone\" tactics, they fall short of the use of force, which is prohibited under international law. Also referred to as \"salami slicing,\" grey-zone tactics that are not strictly attacks make it hard for others to respond without potentially escalating a situation to a conflict.\\n\\nBut not responding to threats of force or military intimidation risks normalizing such aggressive behaviour and emboldening China to further destabilize international peace and stability.\\n\\nSuch acts of harassment and threats can happen not just on Earth but in cyberspace and outer space, all of which can have severe repercussions on civilian life and infrastructure.\\n\\nPattern of reckless behaviour\\n\\nClosely allying with Russia, and actively supplying weapons to sustain its war in Ukraine, China has not concealed its desire to reshape the world order.\\n\\nTaiwan is not alone suffering China\\'s increasingly brazen naval and aerial military operations. Canadian and Australian aircraft enforcing United Nations sanctions against North Korea have also been repeatedly harassed on international waters, where states supposedly enjoy the freedom of navigation.\\n\\nMeanwhile, China is continuously engaged in violent border clashes with India, is challenging the sovereignty of islands that belong to Japan and militarizing islands in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.\\n\\nDeliberate jamming of navigation and emergency distress signals in the Asia-Pacific, which threatens the safety of international aviation, has also been attributed to China.\\n\\nWhy Taiwan matters\\n\\nTech executives around the world were recently in Taiwan to talk about the future of AI and innovative technologies. With Taiwan\\'s prowess in computing technologies and chip production, Jensen Huang -- the Taiwanese-born NVIDIA CEO -- described his homeland as \"the unsung hero, a steadfast pillar of the world.\"\\n\\nBut Taiwan is also on the front lines of an increasingly aggressive and assertive China. On a daily basis, Taiwan experiences the highest rate of cyberattacks in the world originating from China, all aimed at disrupting government services and sowing social distrust.\\n\\nTaiwan has much to share with the world on how to enhance citizen participation in the digital age, counter foreign influence and dispel misinformation and disinformation that undermine trust in democratic institutions and processes.\\n\\nThe latest war games surrounding Taiwan are just another reminder of the various ways China tries to undermine liberal democracies and international peace and security. Today it may be a simulated attack. But the world must stand together and prevent it ever becoming reality.',\n",

       "  'body': 'THE Philippines must partner with like-minded states to navigate rising tensions in the disputed waters while it enhances maritime and economic security.\\n\\nIn a recent forum organized by international think-tank Stratbase ADR Institute in partnership with the Embassy of Australia in the Philippines, acting deputy ambassador Johanna Stratton emphasized the \"unprecedented\" maritime cooperation between Manila and Canberra, as she pointed out the need for alliances to ensure \"a stable and secure Indo-Pacific region, where our maritime and marine environments are protected.\"\\n\\n\"Australia is deeply concerned when countries pursue claims, or engage in activities that are inconsistent with international law; when they undertake activities that are provocative and destabilizing; when they don\\'t respect the freedoms and rights of others; and when they advance their claims by intimidation or coercion,\" Stratton said in the hybrid event \"Forging Bonds: Exploring the Nexus Between Maritime Security and Economic Security\" in Makati City.\\n\\nInternational studies professor Renato de Castro, who is a trustee and program convenor of Stratbase, said China\\'s increased incursions in the West Philippine Sea/South China Sea (WPS/SCS) should be seen not merely as a territorial dispute, but as a case of \"a maritime power bent on expansion.\"\\n\\nHe said the Marcos administration\\'s \"Comprehensive Archipelagic Defense Concept (CADC),\" which is aimed at beefing up the Armed Forces of the Philippines\\' capabilities in countering China\\'s maritime expansion, faces technical and financial constraints, thus the need for allies.\\n\\n\"The [United States] and Australia stand out as the most capable and willing security partners in assisting the Philippines in developing its capabilities to transform the CADC into a viable defense strategy,\" said De Castro, as he noted that both countries are major naval powers in the Indo-Pacific Region.\\n\\nTo leverage on the Philippines\\'s treaty alliance with the US and its security partnership with Australia, the professor insisted that the country should push for the trilateral \"Australia-Philippines-United States Security Partnership\" that can advise, assist, and equip the Philippines in developing the necessary technical and material capabilities to implement its CADC.\\n\\nHe also urged for the enhancement of the Australia-Philippines-US trilateral military exercises that will invite Australian troops to Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement sites, and engage the two countries in security dialogues.\\n\\nFree Indo-Pacific\\n\\nSTRATBASE president Victor Andres Manhit, for his part, agreed that bolstering ties with partners like Australia is a strategic move: \"We...believe that enhanced cooperation with like-minded states is key to the Philippines achieving both maritime and economic security and ultimately, promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific. Amid geopolitical and geoeconomic challenges, such partnerships are strategically necessary to foster regional stability and prosperity.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, retired rear admiral Rommel Jude Ong voiced the need to go beyond \"ceremonial patrols every three months,\" then advocated for continuous 24/7 patrols.\\n\\nFor Prof. Ma. Carmen Ablan-Lagman of De La Salle University, scientific collaboration can serve as a diplomatic tool to foster peaceful relations, build confidence, and promote mutual understanding even in times of conflict.\\n\\n\"As tensions in the [WPS/SCS] escalate, collectively addressing issues such as managing fish stocks, reducing biodiversity loss, preventing marine pollution, and extending humanitarian assistance in response to disasters without prejudice over territorial claims may be needed to build trust among agencies,\" she explained.\\n\\nDistrust\\n\\nCHINA\\'S increased aggression in the region has led to a staggering 91-percent distrust rating among Filipinos, based on a nationwide survey conducted by OCTA Research involving 1,200 respondents in March. Its president Ranjit Rye presented the results in the same forum.\\n\\nMajority, or 76 percent of Filipinos see China \"as the country posing the greatest threat to the Philippines,\" Rye added, while 61 percent support the Marcos administration\\'s response to the dispute.\\n\\nNonetheless, most Filipinos seek further government action, with 73 percent preferring assertive measures such as expanded naval patrols and troop presence in the WPS/SCS over diplomacy and other peaceful methods (72 percent).\\n\\nMoreover, 68 percent of respondents want to strengthen the Philippine military\\'s capability to protect the country\\'s territories.',\n",

       "  'body': 'MANILA, Philippines -- \"The Philippines needs to prepare for \\'external threats\\' due to heightened geopolitical tension in the Indo-Pacific, from the country\\'s proximity to Taiwan to its dispute with China in the West Philippine Sea, President Ferdinand \\'Bongbong\\' R. Marcos Jr. stressed\" (inquirer.net).\\n\\nUS President Barack Obama laid out his \"Pivot to Asia\" in 2011, as he traveled to Honolulu, Australia, and Indonesia for a series of major meetings. The message was of an integrated diplomatic, military, and economic strategy from the Indian subcontinent through Northeast Asia that would \"Profoundly shape the US-China relationship. The core message: America is going to play a leadership role in Asia for decades to come.\"\\n\\nHowever, Obama designed the Trans-Pacific Partnership as the key economic pillar of the Asian pivot and the TPP was dead on arrival. Was the 2012 Beijing taking control of Scarborough Shoal a response to the much heralded but underwhelming \"Pivot to Asia\"? Was \"The Pivot\" merely a sort of bribe to join TPP, which may not have been in the best interests of some regional nations including the Philippines?\\n\\nThe war in the Pacific was basically \"America\\'s War in the Pacific.\" Note the approximate casualties -- killed/missing/wounded -- by nation: Australia/45,000, NZ/12,000, UK/19,000, PHL/30,000, and the US/210,000. China suffered huge military losses (7 million) as a result of the Japanese occupation from 1937.\\n\\nYet, in both Northeast Asia and the South China Sea, the Obama administration formally affirmed its neutrality in territorial disputes involving China. Further, until the end of the Obama presidency, it was all talk, talk, and more talk. \"Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at the ASEAN Regional Forum meeting in mid-2010 stated that the US would be willing to facilitate a collaborative process for addressing the territorial claims.\" We are still waiting.\\n\\n\"A few weeks earlier, President Obama left no doubt that the U.S. military and broader security focus was now shifting from Iraq and Afghanistan to Asia.\" Except then came the Arab Spring and \"We came, we saw, he died,\" Hillary Clinton joked when told of news reports of Qaddafi\\'s death.\\n\\nFast-forward to 2024 and this time the US definitely means it. June 10, 2024 -- Washington Post: \"Adm. Samuel Paparo, the new head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command; The key to thwarting Xi\\'s assumed strategy is a U.S. strategy called \\'Hellscape.\\' The idea is that as soon as China\\'s invasion fleet begins moving across the 100-mile waterway that separates China and Taiwan, the U.S. military would deploy thousands of unmanned submarines, unmanned surface ships and aerial drones to flood the area.\"\\n\\nThe fact that these \"thousands of unmanned submarines, unmanned surface ships, and aerial drones\" do not yet exist is apparently beside the point. It is the thought -- and rhetoric -- that counts.\\n\\nBut what if the People\\'s Republic of China decided to blockade the main island of Taiwan, also known as Formosa? The \"Republic of China\" says that this would be an act of war against a sovereign state.\\n\\nThe position of the Republic of China has been that it is a de jure sovereign state. The US government recognized the government of the People\\'s Republic of China (PRC or China) as the \"sole legal Government of China\" in 1979 and severed official diplomatic relations with the Taiwan-based Republic of China. Currently, Taiwan has 12 diplomatic allies that recognize Taiwan as the sovereign \"ROC.\"\\n\\n\"The Australian Government does not recognize the ROC as a sovereign state and does not regard the authorities in Taiwan as having the status of a national government.\" \"Canada has official, diplomatic relations with the People\\'s Republic of China alone.\" \"France adheres to the One China policy, where France recognized the People\\'s Republic of China as the sole legitimate government of \"China.\"\\n\\nThe point is that without firing a shot, the PRC could effectively force the world to either fully accept its \"sovereignty\" over Taiwan or go to war. However, a total blockade of ships to and from Taiwan might not be necessary.\\n\\nGlobal Guardian, with \"expertise on security matters and duty of care requirements that come with an international corporate footprint,\" says a \\'Gray Zone Embargo\\' is most likely at least initially where \"The PLA would conduct live fire drills more frequently, closing off Taiwan\\'s airspace and sea lanes for longer and longer durations; and sporadically and arbitrarily start to harass Taiwan-bound merchant ships. In turn, this would create political pressure within Taiwan, spook investors, and drive risk premiums up\".\\n\\nNever fear though. September 20, 2023: \"Chinese blockade of Taiwan would likely fail, Pentagon official says\". Then again, September 17, 2022: \"US military intelligence says Putin unable to attain Ukraine goal\".\\n\\nE-mail me at mangun@gmail.com. Follow me on Twitter @mangunonmarkets.

       "  'body': 'New Delhi\\'s strategic and economic interests in the region will only grow, but there are high barriers to increasing the Indian Navy\\'s role in the South China Sea.\\n\\nOn May 26, the Indian Navy (IN)\\'s Eastern Fleet concluded its operational deployment to the South China Sea, entailing port calls to Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Brunei. The IN\\'s almost three-week-long presence in the contested waterways was preceded by the visit of an Indian Coast Guard ship to the South China Sea, which demonstrated shared concerns and resolve regarding regional marine pollution in addition to bolstering cooperation with the coast guards of the littoral nations. These developments have again put a spotlight on India\\'s growing maritime engagement with Southeast Asia\\'s coastal states - four of whom are locked in maritime disputes with China over features in the South China Sea.\\n\\nWhile the IN\\'s deployment in the region is nothing new, its visits to Southeast Asian states have increased four-fold since 2013. The advancing maritime engagement between India and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) should be viewed in the context of India\\'s commercial and strategic interests.\\n\\nNo less than 55 percent of India\\'s total trade passes through the South China Sea. Meanwhile, since the early 1990s, New Delhi has been engaged in a joint hydrocarbon exploration project with Vietnam, wherein its petroleum firm, ONGC Videsh Limited, has invested about $430 million for oil drilling operations in the Phu Kanh Basin of the South China Sea. Despite China\\'s discontent, India and Vietnam signed an agreement in 2011, which aims to develop long-term bilateral cooperation in the oil and gas industry.\\n\\nThe commercial stakes are likely to increase if India\\'s strategic interests serve as any indicators. The 20th Annual ASEAN-India summit held in September 2023 was evidence of economic complementarities and India\\'s intent to deepen commercial engagement with the region. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\\'s 12-point proposal during the summit offered tremendous opportunities for Indian businesses to further trade and commercial ties across various sectors.\\n\\nThe trade between the two civilizational partners is set to receive a boost with the review of the 2009 ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement. The negotiations, which are expected to conclude by 2025, would go a long way in fostering mutually beneficial diversified trade by incorporating changes in Rules of Origin and trade remedies.\\n\\nSimilarly, New Delhi\\'s stakes in Southeast Asia could also be enhanced given its connectivity plans. In 2019, seizing on their mutual interest in exploring the utility of the Eastern Maritime Corridor, India and Russia signed a Memorandum of Intent on the Development of Maritime Communications between the Ports of Chennai and Vladivostok. The potential connectivity corridor would connect Chennai with Vladivostok through the South China Sea. With the route being highly cost-efficient, while also giving access to India to the mineral-rich Arctic, New Delhi remains interested in the project.\\n\\nBased on its commercial stakes, which are likely to increase in the future, it is clear that India has legitimate interests in ensuring the security of shipping lanes and freedom of navigation in the South China Sea.\\n\\nMeanwhile, India\\'s strategic interests in the region, as exemplified by its Act East Policy (AEP) and Indo-Pacific Vision, have also nudged forward its security-oriented engagement in the region.\\n\\nThe AEP\\'s objective of improved connectivity and commerce requires a South China Sea free of traditional and non-traditional security challenges. As a result, India has adopted a security-oriented approach to create an enabling environment for regional stability and prosperity.\\n\\nThe AEP lies at the heart of India\\'s Indo-Pacific Vision, which recognizes ASEAN as a link, connecting the Indian Ocean to the Pacific. India\\'s vision emphasizes the centrality and unity of ASEAN, which will remain pivotal to the former\\'s approach for seeking peace and security in the region. With the shared objectives of ensuring peace and security and adherence to the rule of the law, a multipolar world remains in the interest of both partners.\\n\\nEven as India attempts to enhance its strategic profile to contribute to the equilibrium across the Indo-Pacific, the power balance is slumping in India\\'s backyard, the Indian Ocean region (IOR). China, which has altered the status quo in the South China Sea with its predominant military presence and infrastructure in the region, has also rapidly furthered its strategic engagement with the IOR littorals.\\n\\nBeijing\\'s grand Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which entails unparalleled investments and big-ticket infrastructure projects, including in the IOR, seems to have swayed some of India\\'s neighbors. Its growing economic footprint in the region has facilitated the presence of China\\'s People\\'s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN).\\n\\nSince 2010, an annual average of eight to ten vessels and submarines affiliated with the PLAN and Beijing\\'s Ministry of Natural Resources have been known to operate in the IOR. Besides operating its civilian \"research vessels\" - which were earlier owned by the PLAN and are suspected by India to be used for improving subsurface knowledge and warfare capabilities - China\\'s fishing vessels have been caught within India\\'s territorial waters.\\n\\nBeijing\\'s naval forays, which have fostered anxieties in Indian officials, are bound to increase in the near to mid-term to secure its ever-increasing BRI projects, cargo, and energy shipments. PLAN maneuvers in the IOR draw from China\\'s Military Strategy (CMS) 2015, which combines the call for offshore defense with open seas protection.\\n\\nGoing forward, commercial, strategic, and security interests are likely to compel India to substantially increase its maritime presence in the South China Sea, or even change the region\\'s status from a \"secondary\" area of interest to that of \"primary\" in its next version of its Maritime Security Strategy. However, that pursuit could prove to be particularly onerous.\\n\\nFirst, ASEAN\\'s stance on the South China Sea dispute remains conservative. The bloc\\'s diplomatic diffidence is attributable to intra-ASEAN divisions on the issue. China has successfully exploited the organization\\'s internal discord and isolated Cambodia, Laos, and Brunei from other member states. This is evident by the Four Point Consensus on the South China Sea concluded in 2016, which toes Beijing\\'s position on the dispute.\\n\\nIntra-ASEAN discord has partly fostered China\\'s unabated maritime aggression, jeopardizing the maritime rights and interests of not only littoral navies but also potentially of regional stakeholders such as India. China\\'s continued militarization of the disputed islands, and overwhelming military and paramilitary presence, wherein its coast guard can delineate exclusion zones in virtually any circumstance, could affect freedom of navigation for any foreign vessel, including those from India.\\n\\nSecond, in contrast to China-ASEAN economic engagement, wherein China remains an indispensable economic partner with $722 billion worth of merchandise trade, India-ASEAN trade accounts for $131 billion, a mere 18 percent of China-ASEAN trade. Beijing\\'s investment in the region also remains incomparable. The trade levels between India and ASEAN fall far short of their potential due to a range of issues, including an absence of regional value chains, ASEAN\\'s non-reciprocity in FTA obligations and non-tariff barriers, poor connectivity, and red tape.\\n\\nThese unresolved issues have adversely affected ASEAN\\'s perception of India, creating doubts regarding the latter\\'s political will and capacity to become a leading player in the region. Both economy and security are integral to any country\\'s foreign policy toolkit. The limited economic exchanges serve as an impediment to a potential increase in the IN\\'s deployment, especially given India\\'s acutely limited trade with countries such as Cambodia, Laos, and Brunei, with each of them being highly dependent on Chinese investments. India\\'s greater military presence in the future is likely to find acceptance or become a possibility only if New Delhi becomes a major economic partner in the region.\\n\\nThird, Beijing\\'s pursuit of establishing de-facto control over the South China Sea has seen hawkish official rhetoric regarding the involvement of other stakeholders, including India. India\\'s military engagement in the South China Sea and verbal support for the Philippines in upholding its sovereignty has been followed by an uncompromising response from Chinese officials, demanding that third parties not intervene.\\n\\nThe CMS adopts the same approach toward the regional security dynamics, denouncing the \"meddling\" of some external countries in the South China Sea dispute. This implicit reference seems to be pointing toward extra-territorial players with growing security cooperation such as Japan, India, and above all the United States.\\n\\nFurthermore, acknowledging the imperative of open seas and strategic sea lanes protection, the CMS suggests a commensurate shift in PLAN operations. By increasing the PLAN presence in the IOR, a serious concern for India, China also desires to overcome its \"Malacca dilemma.\" Since 2012, PLAN submarines, totaling three to four platforms on average have been sighted around India\\'s Andaman Islands, leading to the latter\\'s suspicions regarding reconnaissance and surveillance.\\n\\nConsequently, there remains a possibility of an enhanced PLAN presence in the Andamans and the IOR as a counter to a potential increase in IN deployments in the South China Sea.\\n\\nTherefore, China\\'s military strategy and capabilities along with India\\'s weak economic footprint in the region serve as limitations for the IN making the South China Sea into a primary interest area in the coming decades.\\n\\nNonetheless, the IN should continue to maintain across-the-spectrum operational engagements with its counterparts in the South China Sea. India needs to step up its strategic role, explore convergences in capacity-building sectors such as digital innovation, and leverage complementarities in trade with the ASEAN.\\n\\nIn the near term, besides broad-based cooperation on maritime domain awareness, New Delhi would do well to probe trilateral exercises with littoral navies and conclude long overdue logistic pacts with Indonesia and Malaysia. The considerations of India\\'s commercial interests and balance of power necessitate New Delhi\\'s constant focus on its maritime diplomacy to ensure secure seas and adherence to the rule of law.',\n",

       "  'body': 'THE Independence Day celebration in Cebu on Wednesday morning, June 12, 2024, was marked with protest from left-leaning groups and speeches from local government leaders.\\n\\nProtesters from various groups walked from Plaza Independencia to Freedom Park, then held a program on Colon St. in downtown Cebu City from 9:30 a.m. until noon.\\n\\nSome carried placards with messages like \"Atin ang Pilipinas US ug China, Layas (The Philippines belongs to us. US and China, get out)!\" and \"Demilitarize West Philippine Sea.\"\\n\\nBayan Central Visayas coordinator John Ruiz, in an interview, said the country is not yet fully liberated.\\n\\n\"We are doing this protest to remind our people that the Philippines is still in its quest to achieve the true liberation of the country,\" he said.\\n\\nRuiz said they have problems with the continued U.S. military presence through the Visiting Forces Agreement and Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement as it \"endangers\" Filipinos with \"the geopolitical competitionwith China.\"\\n\\n\"China\\'s bullying and encroachment is also an issue. We need to unite with other countries and not rely on US military posturing in the region,\" he said in Cebuano.\\n\\nChina and the Philippines have an ongoing dispute over the West Philippine Sea, a portion of the South China Sea.\\n\\nChina claims almost the entire South China Sea based on its historical \"nine-dash line,\" while the Philippines asserts its rights within its exclusive economic zone as defined by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\\n\\nIn 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines in a landmark case against China\\'s claims in the South China Sea. The tribunal concluded that China\\'s \"nine-dash line\" claim, which it used to assert historical rights over most of the sea, had no legal basis under international law.\\n\\nSpeeches\\n\\nMeanwhile, local governments held programs with leaders delivering speeches that tackled history.\\n\\nIn Cebu City, Acting Mayor Raymond Alvin Garcia addressed corruption and injustices in his speech. He emphasized that apathy and societal issues hinder national progress and urged his constituents to emulate the resilience and determination of the country\\'s forefathers.\\n\\nGarcia highlighted the power of the people to shape the city\\'s and nation\\'s identity.\\n\\n\"May we then continue to do our part and fight our own battles to help build a stronger and resilient Cebu City and Philippines,\" he said.\\n\\n\"May we all rekindle within ourselves the same burning fire for patriotism and love of the country of our heroes,\" he added.\\n\\nFor his part, Lapu-Lapu City Mayor Junard \"Ahong\" Chan said Independence Day symbolizes the nation\\'s triumph, urging citizens to prioritize love for the country and strive for a more prosperous Philippines.\\n\\nHe highlighted the nation\\'s journey from war to freedom, acknowledging heroes like Lapulapu, Jose Rizal and Andres Bonifacio.\\n\\nHis wife, Lapu-Lapu Lone District Rep. Ma. Cynthia \"Cindi\" Chan also recognized the sacrifices of ancestors.\\n\\nIn Mandaue City, Mayor Jonas Cortes urged his fellow citizens to value the efforts of Filipino forefathers who fought for freedom.\\n\\nCortes said nation-building starts with the people being responsible citizens.\\n\\n\"The future lets us move forward filled with hope and promise each step we take no matter how small brings us closer to Mandaue that is vibrant, inclusive and resilience,\" he said.\\n\\nCelebrities Barbie Forteza and David Licauco joined Mandaue\\'s Independence Day celebration.\\n\\nPhilippine Independence Day is a national holiday observed every year on June 12.

       "  'title': 'A step towards peace in Ukraine',\n",
       "  'body': \"The Summit on Peace organised by Switzerland will bring together almost 100 nations from all parts of the globe to discuss how to initiate a process to end the war against Ukraine. The EU fully supports these efforts. No one desires peace more than the Ukrainian people, but lasting peace can only be achieved if it is grounded in the core principles of the UN Charter.\\n\\nThis weekend, I will attend the Summit on Peace in Ukraine in Switzerland. It is not a platform for direct negotiations between Ukraine and Russia. This Summit rather aims to develop among the participating countries common parameters for peace, grounded in international law and the UN Charter.\\n\\nThe Summit will also focus on selected practical issues on which to engage Russia: how to enhance nuclear security, facilitate the exchange of captives and ensure the return of the many thousands of Ukrainian children abducted to Russia, a practice that harks back to darker periods of European history. It will also focus on ensuring free navigation and protecting Black Sea port infrastructure. The impact of the war of aggression against Ukraine extends far beyond its borders. A protracted or frozen conflict would perpetuate instability and threaten global food security and economic stability. Progress in these areas could open avenues for engagement with Russia in other areas over time.\\n\\nThis war and its outcome are existential for Ukraine, but also for European security. Any ceasefire that would allow Russia to keep its repressive regime in occupied territories would reward this aggression, undermine international law and encourage further territorial expansion by Russia. Every UN report since 2022 provides ample evidence of the brutal repression of Ukrainians and the systematic human rights violations in occupied Ukraine.\\n\\nRussia is fighting an unprovoked war of choice, driven by imperial ambition, while Ukraine is fighting a war of necessity, defending its very right to exist.\\n\\nNo one desires peace more than the Ukrainians. However, the right conditions for peace matter for Ukraine and for the world. Russia is fighting an unprovoked war of choice, driven by imperial ambition, while Ukraine is fighting a war of necessity, defending its very right to exist. As Vladimir Putin said again in Saint Petersburg a few days ago, he pursues full victory on the battlefield and sees no urgency to end the war. Only a few weeks ago, he launched a new offensive against Kharkiv. His missiles have largely destroyed Ukraine's energy infrastructure and continue to kill Ukrainian civilians every day.\\n\\nMeanwhile, his envoys tour the world to discourage countries from engaging in the Summit for Peace. Russia is obviously not ready to engage in good faith negotiations and would use any ceasefire to rearm and attack again. Russia's narratives around peace are merely disguised attempts to legitimise its war of territorial conquest.\\n\\nConsequently, Russia's declaration that it would not attend the Swiss summit, even if invited, did not come as a surprise. However, the participation of close to 100 countries and organizations, from Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America, indicates robust international support to end the war on the basis of the UN Charter. This is crucial to reassure Ukraine, the victim of Russia's war of aggression, ahead of any possible engagement with Russia.\\n\\nThe participation of close to 100 countries and organizations, from Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America, indicates robust international support to end the war on the basis of the UN Charter.\\n\\nOther proposals will also be discussed at the Summit, but we believe that Ukraine's 10-point peace formula remains the most credible basis for future peace negotiations. Proposals that do not reference the UN Charter and ignore Ukraine's political sovereignty, territorial integrity and right to self-defence would amount to rewarding the aggressor and legitimising Russia's attempts to redraw borders by force. Such proposals cannot bring lasting peace. In this regard, the absence of China in Switzerland and its outreach to discourage participation do not strengthen China's claims of neutrality.\\n\\nThe EU wants peace in Ukraine. A diplomatic solution that respects international norms would have the backing of all EU Member States. At the same time, we must continue to match our diplomatic efforts with military support, in line with Ukraine's inherent right to self-defence as per article 51 of the UN Charter. Given that Putin shows no intention to negotiate in good faith, Europe's continued military support to Ukraine remains just as crucial to peace in Ukraine as our support for a diplomatic track.\\n\\nYes, wars generally tend to end with a peace agreement, but the content of this peace agreement is crucial to European and global security, and the international rules-based order. Let's make the Summit on Peace in Switzerland a first step to a fair, UN Charter-based peace in Ukraine.\",\n",

       "  'body': 'Vietnam\\'s new President To Lam has asked that Beijing respect Hanoi\\'s rights and interests in disputed waters, days after Vietnamese officials protested against what they called \"China\\'s illegal activities\" in the Gulf of Tonkin.\\n\\nLast Thursday, a Vietnamese foreign ministry spokesperson denounced the operation of the Chinese navy survey vessel Hai Yang 26 in Vietnam\\'s exclusive economic zone and continental shelf and said that Vietnam \"has engaged in multiple diplomatic exchanges\" with China to demand the ending of such operations.\\n\\nTo Lam, while not mentioning the Hai Yang 26, told Chinese ambassador to Vietnam Xiong Bo that the two neighbors should strictly implement bilateral agreements, better control and resolve disagreements at sea, as well as respect each other\\'s legitimate rights and interests, his office said in a statement .\\n\\nThe two countries should also actively seek appropriate ways to settle maritime disputes in accordance with international law, especially the U.N. Convention on the law of the sea (UNCLOS), he said.\\n\\nThe new president stressed that Vietnam saw its relationship with China as a \"strategic choice and top priority\" of its foreign policy.\\n\\nLam was sworn in as Vietnam\\'s state president on May 22 amid an unprecedented reshuffle of the communist party\\'s leadership following the \"burning furnace\" anti-graft campaign initiated by party chief Nguyen Phu Trong.\\n\\nXiong Bo became the first foreign ambassador to pay Lam a courtesy call to congratulate him on his new post.\\n\\nHai Yang 26\\n\\nIn last week\\'s unusually strong rebuke, foreign ministry spokeswoman Pham Thu Hang said that Vietnam was \"deeply concerned,\" resolutely opposed, and demanded that China immediately stop the \"illegal survey activities\" of the Hai Yang 26 in Vietnam\\'s waters and not repeat them.\\n\\nHang told reporters in Hanoi that the Vietnamese government \"has engaged in multiple diplomatic exchanges\" with the Chinese side over the case.\\n\\nChinese survey vessels have frequently operated in Vietnam\\'s exclusive economic zone but it has seldom publicly protested, giving preference to quieter bilateral channels.\\n\\nA Vietnamese analyst, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue, said that the new leader - who was seen as a hard-liner because of his public security background -- may want to show that he is not pro-China, as some critics say.\\n\\nAnother analyst, Hoang Viet, told RFA that the foreign ministry\\'s reaction was due to the severity of the event, as well as to partially direct attention to Vietnam amid increased tensions between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea.\\n\\nHai Yang 26 is one of nine Type 636A hydrographic survey vessels in service with the Chinese People\\'s Liberation Army navy.\\n\\nThis kind of survey ship is thought to be utilized by the navy for mapping the underwater topography map in areas where submarines operate, as well as to conduct marine surveys, such as the study of ocean acoustics.\\n\\nThe fact that Vietnam had \"multiple diplomatic exchanges\" with China over the vessel suggested it had been operating in Vietnam\\'s waters for a prolonged period.\\n\\nChina has yet to respond to Vietnam\\'s protest but a Chinese think tank, the South China Sea Probing Initiative, wrote on the social media platform X that the Hai Yang 26 only conducted a freedom of navigation operation, a type of patrol that China itself has deemed provocative on numerous occasions when conducted by other navies.',\n",

The list of the places has been prepared by the Army's Information Warfare Division and is expected to be released soon.\\n\\nThe new names of the places are based on historical research and the opinions of the local residents. Notably, China recently renamed some areas of Arunachal Pradesh unilaterally, claiming that the territory belongs to them. India's move is seen as a retaliation to this move by the dragon. China refers to Arunachal Pradesh as 'Zangnan'. However, India has consistently rejected all of China's claims.\\n\\nALSO READ: Chandrababu Naidu Takes Oath As Andhra Pradesh CM; Pawan Kalyan, Nara Lokesh Sworn In As Ministers\\n\\nRecently, top officials of the Indian Army visited the disputed border areas.\\n\\nIn March, China renamed 30 places along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Arunachal, including 11 residential areas, 12 mountains, four rivers, one lake, one mountain pass, and a piece of land. It was the fourth instance when China renamed places which belonged to India. The first list of six such places was released by them in 2017, the second of 15 places in 2021, and a third list with names for 11 places in 2023.\\n\\nChina and India have been at loggerheads over a plethora of issues, including territorial claims, for the last few decades.

       "  'title': 'Vietnam on Record Pace for Spratly Island Construction in 2024, Report Says',\n",
       "  'body': 'Over the past six months, the country has reclaimed almost as much new land as it did in the previous two years combined, closing the gap with China\\'s \"island fortresses.\"\\n\\nVietnam has \"significantly accelerated\" the expansion of its outposts in the Spratly Islands over the last six months, a U.S. think tank said last week, putting Hanoi on pace for a \"record year of island building\" in 2024.\\n\\nIn a briefing published on June 7, the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative (AMTI) stated that the country had created \"almost as much new land as it had in the previous two years combined.\"\\n\\nAMTI, run by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., said that since November 2023, Vietnam had created 692 new acres (280 hectares) of land across 10 features in the Spratly Islands. In comparison, it made 404 acres (163.5 hectares) of land in the first 11 months of 2023 and 342 acres (138.4 hectares) in all of 2022.\\n\\nBarque Canada Reef remains Vietnam\\'s largest outpost in the Spratlys, the report said, nearly doubling over the last six months from 238 to 412 acres (96 to 167 hectares).\\n\\nAccording to AMTI, Vietnam has considerably closed the gap with China in terms of the amount of space that it has created in the Spratly Islands. The country now boasts five of the 10 largest features in the Spratly Islands, which are occupied (and disputed) by China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Brunei. While the three largest Chinese-occupied features - Mischief Reef, Subi Reef, and Fiery Cross Reef - remain the largest by a considerable way, the next four largest outposts are all newly expanded Vietnamese features: Barque Canada Reef, Namyit Island, Pearson Reef, and Discovery Great Reef. The remaining positions in the top ten are taken up by Itu Aba (occupied by Taiwan), Thitu Island (the Philippines), and Sand Cay (Vietnam).\\n\\nVietnam\\'s total dredging and landfill in disputed areas of the South China Sea amounts to approximately 2,360 acres (955 hectares), around half of China\\'s 4,650 acres (1,882 hectares), up from just 329 acres (133 hectares) three years ago.\\n\\nHowever, while Vietnam\\'s expanding acreage in the Spratly Islands is now comparable to the real estate that China has reclaimed over the past decade, it still faces a large gap in terms of facilities. Subi, Mischief, and Fiery Cross reefs now each boast multi-story administrative buildings, advanced radar arrays, jet hangars, and 3,000-meter runways capable of handling the largest Chinese bombers. The other four reclaimed Chinese features in the Spratly Archipelago include similarly advanced facilities on a smaller scale.\\n\\nVietnam boasts a single 1,300-meter runway on Spratly Island, though AMTI noted that Barque Canada Reef now measures 4,318 meters in length, giving it \"the potential to host a 3,000-meter runway like those that China has at Fiery Cross, Mischief, and Subi Reefs.\"\\n\\nAMTI notes that Vietnam has also begun \"preliminary construction\" of new facilities on its 10 features. \"Notable developments include the completion of a boat ramp on Namyit Island and the construction of a new harbor at Central Reef,\" the briefing stated. It stated that temporary helipads could be seen at a number of the artificial islands, while \"trenches and coastal defense emplacements typical of Vietnam\\'s Spratly outposts can be seen underway at several features.\"\\n\\nThe rash of reclamation and dredging activity indicates Vietnam\\'s desire to close the gap with China in the disputed waterway and create its own \"facts on the ground\" at a time of growing tensions in disputed waters, particularly between China and the Philippines.\\n\\nIt is unlikely that Vietnam will ever eclipse China\\'s \"island fortresses,\" either in qualitative or quantitative terms, but its efforts indicate a desire to hold the line against Chinese incursions, defend its sovereign claims in the Spratly Islands, and help preserve the tense status quo in contested waters.',\n",

       "  'title': \"Chinese in Malaysia: Proud of China's Rise, Yet Fiercely Malaysian | FULCRUM\",\n",
       "  'body': \"Chinese Malaysians are proud of China's rise as a great power. But they have also forged a separate cultural identity quite apart from China's efforts.\\n\\nChina's rise has rekindled civilizational pride among some overseas Chinese communities, including those in Malaysia. However, Malaysian Chinese have also forged a distinctive localised cultural identity, intertwined with an unmistakable sense of national belonging as Malaysians.\\n\\nBeijing has long recognised overseas Chinese as an essential bridge linking China to the outside world. In recent years, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the State Council has intensified its efforts to strengthen ties with the Chinese diaspora. Some within the Southeast Asian Chinese community have emerged as intermediaries facilitating connections between China and the international community, especially in trade and commerce. More broadly, Beijing's outreach efforts, like the recently launched Global Civilization Initiative, have sparked a resurgence of cultural connections. Platforms such as CCTV, WeChat, and TikTok serve as channels through which overseas Chinese are rekindling their fascination with China's history and traditions.\\n\\nIn Malaysia, the Chinese community, especially among the English-educated, is undergoing a phenomenon some refer to as re-Sinicisation. This is broadly defined as a renewed interest and enthusiasm for embracing their Chinese cultural roots. Mandarin, for example, is gradually replacing English as the predominant working language within the Malaysian Chinese community, alongside Malay, the national language. The re-Sinicisation process has emerged as a contentious issue, particularly concerning the cultural identity of the Malaysian Chinese. Recently, former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad reignited the discourse by questioning the loyalty of the Chinese community, citing perceived hesitance on their part in fully embracing other cultures. The increasing influence of China adds another layer of complexity to this issue.\\n\\nNonetheless, the crisis of Chinese cultural identity in Malaysia is intricately linked to the nation's complicated experiment with multiculturalism. Unlike countries like Indonesia, Malaysia chose accommodation over assimilation in dealing with its minority population. Chinese in Malaysia, for instance, are allowed to retain their Chinese names, whereas in Indonesia, they are required to adopt Indonesian names. This policy has proven to be a double-edged sword. The celebration of diversity is done at the expense of the country's aspiration for unity. This has led to a lack of a unified Malaysian cultural identity.\\n\\nThe rise of China has sparked a resurgence of civilisational pride among Chinese communities in Malaysia. Nevertheless, Malaysian Chinese have forged a distinct localized cultural identity, enriched with unique Malaysian characteristics.\\n\\nThe Malaysian education system encapsulates this challenge. In addition to national schools, Malaysia offers minorities the option to attend vernacular schools. However, the perceived shortcomings of the public school system have led most Chinese families to opt for vernacular schools. This has resulted in segregation, undermining efforts to cultivate a shared national identity. The government's efforts to foster a common identity are perceived by minorities as attempts to erode the country's diversity. Thus, Sinicisation is foremost driven by this struggle to safeguard what Malaysian Chinese believe are their constitutional rights.\\n\\nTo be sure, the Malaysian Chinese community is a culturally diverse group, encompassing Malay-speaking Peranakans, as well as those educated in English and Chinese. While there is a collective effort to preserve the country's pluralism, it is noteworthy that the Chinese-educated segment takes a leading role in advocating for it, thereby elevating the profile of the Mandarin language. Nevertheless, the Malaysian Chinese community remains richly diverse, with Peranakans and the English-educated maintaining their multicultural, multilingual way-of-life.\\n\\nThe culturally diverse Malaysian Chinese also exhibit distinct differences from their counterparts on the mainland. One contributing factor is that the Malaysian Chinese community was spared the Cultural Revolution. Unlike their mainland counterparts, they have preserved many traditional norms, particularly those related to religious beliefs. Furthermore, interaction with the Malay and Indian community has enriched Malaysian Chinese culture, infusing it with unique Malaysian characteristics. Peranakan cuisine exemplifies how Malay and Indian-style cooking have embellished the Malaysian Chinese culinary tradition. This cultural synergy extends across various domains, including linguistic fusion, architecture designs, fashion, and musical expression. While Malaysian Chinese acknowledge their ancestral ties to China, their cultural identity has primarily been shaped by domestic influences. This has resulted in the development of traits that are distinctly Malaysian, setting them apart from their fellow Chinese on the mainland.\\n\\nUndoubtedly, citizenship stands as the defining factor that differentiates Malaysian Chinese from their counterparts in China. In 1955, Premier Zhou Enlai encouraged overseas Chinese to embrace local citizenship and integrate into the societies they found themselves in. However, some have raised concerns that China's present leadership is blurring this distinction, with stronger appeals by Beijing to Chinese overseas to support China.\\n\\nThe overseas Chinese narrative is but one among numerous migration stories, including those of the Irish and Indian diaspora. Nonetheless, a distinguishing aspect for the Chinese is the geopolitical rivalry between their ancestral homeland, China, and the US. Consequently, some overseas Chinese find themselves caught in the crosshairs of this great power competition.\\n\\nThe Malaysian government has consistently maintained a neutral stance in the ensuing Sino-US rivalry. However, the Malaysian Chinese media frequently adopts a discernible pro-China perspective in this ongoing geopolitical contestation. That said, Malaysian Chinese support for China is not unconditional. When issues arise that directly impact Malaysia's sovereignty, such as the territorial disputes in the South China Sea, Malaysian Chinese media have taken a clear and unequivocal nationalistic stance in support of Malaysia.\\n\\nThe rise of China has sparked a resurgence of civilisational pride among Chinese communities in Malaysia. Nevertheless, Malaysian Chinese have forged a distinct localised cultural identity, enriched with unique Malaysian characteristics. While they acknowledge and celebrate China's reemergence, they maintain a deep-rooted sense of belonging to Malaysia. Indeed, their Malaysian nationality is the primary foundation of Malaysian Chinese self-identity.\",\n",

High resolution satellite imagery, accurate positioning systems, advanced depth imaging equipment sophisticated data and analysis tools allow us to produce detail maps, nautical charts, monitor coastal changes, predict sea level fluctuations with unprecedented accuracy,\" Chief Hydrographer stated.\\n\\nAccording to him, geospatial technologies, which provide a common platform for collaboration enabling countries to share data and build trust, are facing some challenges, including those related to information sharing, technological capacity, and infrastructure.\\n\\nHe advocated that establishing protocols and frameworks for data sharing, developing capability, and promoting partnerships between government agencies and the private sector is crucial to developing expertise in the domain. As a Hydrographer, Vice Admiral Pathania stated that he has witnessed first-hand the transformative potential of geospatial technology in enhancing maritime safety and security.\\n\\nThe other key speaker at the two-day Forum, Lt. Gen Rakesh Kapoor, Deputy Chief of the Army Staff (Information Systems and Coordination), said the Indo-Pacific is the region of hope since it is an economic powerhouse and nearly half of the world\\'s population resides here.\\n\\n\"Over 35% of global cybercrimes occur within the confines of Indo-pacific geography. Human trafficking, illegal fishing, drugs, and piracy are all on the rise in this region, leading to loss of livelihoods,\" Lt Gen Kapoor stated to outline the trends in the region.\\n\\nThe next important global trend is the dwindling authority of the international institutions, Kapoor pointed out.\\n\\nThe two-day event will throw light on the combined power of geospatial intelligence, space-based assets, and cutting-edge innovation to tackle emerging threats in the Indo-Pacific.\\n\\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on June 12, 2024',\n",

       "  'title': \"Analysts see rising war threat in China's new South China Sea policies\",\n",
       "  'body': 'Military experts are warning of an increased risk of war with China following recent announcements by Beijing providing for more aggressive enforcement of its claims to disputed regions of the South China Sea.\\n\\nLate last month, China announced its coast guard will be empowered to investigate and detain for up to 60 days \"foreigners who endanger China\\'s national security and interests\" in the disputed waters. The policy will take effect on June 15.\\n\\nAnd on June 8, it announced it would permit the Philippines to deliver supplies and evacuate personnel from an outpost on the disputed Second Thomas Shoal, which has been determined by an international tribunal to lie within Philippine waters, only if it first notifies Beijing.\\n\\nThe Philippine National Security Council replied that the country will continue to maintain and supply its outposts in the South China Sea without seeking permission from any other country.\\n\\nIn a formal statement under the council\\'s letterhead, national security adviser Eduardo Ano dismissed the suggestion as\"absurd, ridiculous and unacceptable.\"\\n\\nAccording to a June 10 report in the South China Morning Post, a survey released by independent polling agency OCTA Research showed that 73% of Filipinos support further military action to safeguard the Philippines\\' territorial rights, including expanded naval patrols and the dispatch of additional troops.\\n\\nPhilippine media believe the new procedures will empower the Chinese coast guard to \"arbitrarily\" arrest Filipinos in their own waters. China\\'s claims to almost the entire sea reach into the internationally recognized economic zones of several Southeast Asian countries.\\n\\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. called the new rules \"totally unacceptable\" and said he will take all necessary measures to \"protect citizens\" and continue to\"defend the country\\'s territory.\"\\n\\nIn his keynote speech at the Shangri-La Security Dialogue in Singapore on May 31, the president pointed out that if a Filipino was killed in a South China Sea conflict with China, it would\"almost certainly\" cross a red line and come \"very close\" to what the Philippines defines as an act of war.\\n\\nJohn C. Aquilino, former head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, testified before the U.S. Congress last month that Manila could invoke the 1951 U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty in such a case.\\n\\nBob Savic, head of international trade at the Global Policy Institute in London, said last week that this could bring the United States and China into a direct conflict.\\n\\n\"The trigger for the First World War occurred on June 28, 1914, with the assassination of Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand in a country in Southeast Europe. This time, the trigger could be the death of a Filipino sailor in the tropical waters of Southeast Asia,\" he wrote in an article published in the Asia Times.\\n\\nHe believes if Manila is forced to request U.S. assistance under the Mutual Defense Treaty, it is conceivable that China Coast Guard ships would quickly confront U.S. warships maintaining freedom of navigation in the region. \\\\\"The U.S. and China must ensure they don\\'t sleepwalk into a repeat of the 1914 tragedy in the second half of June 2024 or, indeed, at any point in the future,\" Savic wrote.\\n\\n\\'It might trigger escalation\\'\\n\\nAndrea Chloe Wong, a nonresident research fellow at the Institute for Indo-Pacific Affairs, told VOA at a June 6 seminar hosted by the National Bureau of Asian Research that if the Mutual Defense Treaty is invoked, \"it might trigger escalation or conflict between the Philippines and China.\"\\n\\nThe safety of Filipino personnel has become the focus of recent rounds of South China Sea disputes. On June 7, the Philippines accused a Chinese coast guard ship of ramming a Philippine ship, deterring the evacuation of a sick soldier from a grounded warship which serves as a Philippine military outpost on the Second Thomas Shoal.\\n\\nRomeo Brawner, chief of staff of the armed forces of the Philippines, told reporters June 4 that Chinese coast guard officers had seized some food that a plane dropped for Philippine naval personnel aboard the aging warship. He also released video of the incident, AP reported.\\n\\nDespite the rising tension, Oriana Skylar Mastro, a Center Fellow at Stanford University\\'s Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, told VOA that the possibility of World War III breaking out in the South China Sea is not high.\\n\\nShe believes that China will not choose to fight a war in the South China Sea at this time because they know they would lose.\\n\\n\"They can\\'t project power across those kinds of distances yet. When I talk to the PLA [People\\'s Liberation Army, China\\'s principal military force], they say the only reason they haven\\'t declared internal waters in the Spratly [chain] is because there\\'s no way they can enforce that.\"\\n\\nUS promises assets, say reports\\n\\nThe United States Coast Guard has promised to send assets to the South China Sea to help Manila uphold sovereign rights in its exclusive economic zone, ABS-CBN News said Tuesday, citing the Philippine Coast Guard.\\n\\nIn a statement, the Philippine Coast Guard said the U.S. Coast Guard will deploy its North Pacific Coast Guard following a proposal by Philippine Admiral Ronnie Gil Gavan. Gavan called for a \"greater deployment\" in the high seas \"to address the forthcoming threat\" posed by China\\'s threat to arrest foreigners inside what it claims as its maritime boundaries.\\n\\nIn a research report released last month by the National Bureau of Asian Research, Michael Shoebridge of the Strategic Analysis Australia pointed out that collective action by the Philippines and its allies could effectively reduce risks in the South China Sea.\\n\\n\"The risk of such collective action escalating into conflict is real. However, it could be mitigated by the militaries clearly acting within international law and coordinating a united political response to demonstrate and communicate this,\" he wrote. \"That would counter Chinese efforts\"to intimidate others and cast such lawful action as aggression.\"\\n\\nShoebridge, who also attended the National Bureau of Asian Research\\'s June 6 seminar, said at the meeting that \"unless we cause Chinese policy and action to fail, we are leaving all the leverage with Beijing, and we are waiting for our servicemen and women to be killed by the PLA. And that\\'s not the future that I want.\"',\n",

       "  'body': 'Not even Russia\\'s comprehensive strategic partner China wants that.\\n\\nIndia\\'s new government will deal with a US which remains the world\\'s top policeman, but one whose power has been diminished by the Israel-Hamas war because of its inability to control Israel\\'s relentless flattening of Gaza, and Washington\\'s incremental military aid to Ukraine. The latter has led Ukraine to lose the initiative it gained in repelling Russia\\'s invasion in the first year of the war in 2022, and spurred Moscow to escalate the war and deliver several threats to use nuclear weapons, the last being on June 6.\\n\\nNot even Russia\\'s comprehensive strategic partner China wants that. Additionally, Russia\\'s assault on Ukraine has been prolonged because of China\\'s diplomatic, economic, and -- it is whispered -- military support to Russia. India will continue to face the regional and global ramifications of that long war.\\n\\nAmerica is suffering from imperial overstretch and is finding it hard to cope with two hot wars -- one in Europe and the other in the Middle East. A third war is possible in the Asia-Pacific over Taiwan. Fear of that war impelled President Biden to withdraw American forces from Afghanistan in August 2021. That shambolic withdrawal encouraged Russia to assume that America was a do-nothing power and probably encouraged it to invade Ukraine. An end to the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza and Russia\\'s war are unlikely in the foreseeable future. Both have international repercussions. Many Pacific Asians are concerned about the possible impact of America\\'s reliability, especially if China invades Taiwan.\\n\\nWar clouds are hanging over Pacific Asia. As Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has repeatedly said, \"Today\\'s Ukraine may be the East Asia of tomorrow.\" For America and its Pacific allies, including Japan, South Korea, the Philippines and Australia, it is essential to strengthen their security bonds.\\n\\nJapan is destined to become the world\\'s third-largest military power within five years. The reasons include its technological advancement. In the field of technology, it is the only Asian country which can counter China.\\n\\nHopes of driving a wedge between China and Russia -- entertained by both India and America -- are unrealistic, given how much Beijing and Moscow have helped each other, especially over the last decade. Geographically Russia is a Eurasian power, and China a Pacific one. The Russia-China relationship has helped to make China an Arctic and Mediterranean power -- an achievement since China does not have any coastline in those areas. In contrast, Russia has coastal frontiers in Europe, the Baltic Sea region, the Mediterranean and Pacific. The wide-ranging strategic ties with Russia have also enabled China to strengthen its position in the Middle East-Suez area. All this has been possible because China\\'s economic progress has empowered it to spread its military and economic tentacles worldwide.\\n\\nAs the senior partner in its relationship with Russia, China has been quick to show that it has the upper hand. Beijing does not want to buy as much Russian energy as Moscow would like and it wants to pay lower prices than Russia wants. But that will not upset their relationship because Ukraine-related Western sanctions on have made Russia too dependent on China.\\n\\nChina and Russia dislike the Quad, but Beijing is ultimately dismissive of the Quad which, because of a non-aligned India\\'s membership, is not a force against China. It is more concerned about the militarisation of Japan and the strengthening of US alliances. While Beijing has congratulated Prime Minister Modi on his electoral success, the state-steered Global Times is dismissive of India\\'s ability to compete economically with China. The paper identifies India\\'s society, especially the caste system, as the reason behind the limited education of Indians, which \"directly impacts the overall labour productivity\". India\\'s long-term rise as the \"world\\'s factory\" will therefore be a long haul.\\n\\nFrom ambitious global manufacturing goals to various domestic issues, Modi will face hurdles \"not only about education levels but also cultural constraints\". The Global Times also sniggers at India\\'s dependence on China for Chinese goods and raw materials even as Modi talks about replacing the neighbour in the global supply chain. India-China trade touched $118 billion last year.\\n\\nEconomically, India\\'s absence from the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the largest regional economic pact in the world, shows its weakness against China. Vietnam, Indonesia, and Malaysia are all ahead of India. Free trade agreements (FTAs) with the European Free Trade Association and Australia cannot give India a strong regional or international presence. Talks with the European Union and Britain for FTAs have not made progress.\\n\\nGenerally, many multinationals are reluctant to leave China because of better investment conditions although labour is less expensive in India. Delhi pays scant attention to such complaints about investment conditions in India, which come even from some of its largest investors including Japan, America, and Germany.\\n\\nBig business friends of India\\'s ruling establishment cannot cover up the problems stemming from a poorly educated workforce and the difficulties that small and medium enterprises confront in taking off. Protectionism leads many Indian manufacturers to dump shoddy goods on Indians -- and ultimately works against India gaining ground in world markets.\\n\\nIndo-US ties will continue to make progress, but India cannot help much in the Pacific -- which is the top priority of America and its allies as they gear up for war over Taiwan and confront China\\'s claims to the South China Sea.\\n\\nAs geopolitical shifts trouble the world, India\\'s economic interests will be served if it uses its diplomatic skills to help the international community to end the hot wars being fought in Ukraine and the Middle East.',\n",

       "  'title': 'India to rename two dozen places in Tibet Region',\n",
       "  'body': 'Girish Linganna\\n\\nIndia has initiated a retaliatory effort against China\\'s renaming of locations in India\\'s Arunachal Pradesh state. The Indian government intends to rename over two dozen places in China\\'s Tibet Autonomous Region as a response.\\n\\nAccording to The Diplomat, a media organization, they have obtained a comprehensive list of the places that will be renamed in China\\'s Tibet Autonomous Region. Indian military sources have provided this list, and it is anticipated that the official release will take place once the new government assumes power in Delhi, following the formation of the new government.\\n\\nStarting on June 8, Modi will serve his third term as Prime Minister with a smaller majority, necessitating reliance on coalition partners for governing. However, this reduced political space is unlikely to significantly affect foreign policy, as there is broad support across multiple political parties for Modi\\'s objective of enhancing India\\'s global influence and power.\\n\\nNew Delhi suspects that China\\'s renaming of places in Arunachal Pradesh is an attempt to bolster Beijing\\'s territorial claim on this large province in northeastern India, which China refers to as Zangnan or \"southern Tibet.\" This move is seen as an effort to assert control over the region and consolidate China\\'s influence.\\n\\nAccording to The Diplomat, the Indian Army\\'s information warfare division is believed to be responsible for the renaming of Tibetan places in Arunachal Pradesh. Additionally, with the support of renowned research institutes such as the Asiatic Society in Kolkata, the Indian Army has been actively disproving the legitimacy of the Chinese names by conducting thorough research. Their efforts aim to counter China\\'s narrative and provide accurate information regarding the region.\\n\\nUnder its logo, the Indian Army has shared detailed tweets that challenge China\\'s renaming of seven places in Arunachal Pradesh. Furthermore, they are actively working to counter the renaming of all the other 30 or so places that the Chinese government has renamed. The tweets aim to provide accurate information and refute China\\'s attempts to assert control over these regions.\\n\\nIndia\\'s military has recently compiled a list of over 30 places in Tibet that are set to be renamed. The objective behind this is to reclaim their ancient names in Indian languages, which are derived from historical records. This initiative aims to restore and recognize the historical significance of these places based on authentic sources.\\n\\nAccording to sources, this list of renamed places in Tibet will soon be made public through various media platforms. This is part of a larger global campaign aimed at presenting a compelling counter-narrative to China\\'s claims on India\\'s Arunachal Pradesh state and other disputed border regions. The intention is to showcase India\\'s perspective and challenge China\\'s assertions by providing alternative viewpoints and historical evidence.\\n\\nMilitary officials, who wished to remain anonymous, have stated that the new names given to these places are supported by thorough historical research. This signifies that considerable efforts have been made to ensure the accuracy and legitimacy of the chosen names.\\n\\nAccording to an Ex IB officer, if India proceeds with the renaming campaign, it would essentially reopen the issue of Tibet. Although India has recognized Tibet as part of China following its forcible occupation by Beijing, the current Modi government shows a willingness to change its stance in order to counter China\\'s aggressive actions. This shift in approach reflects India\\'s efforts to challenge China\\'s territorial claims and renaming initiatives, as reported by The Diplomat.\\n\\nIn recent weeks, the Indian Army has arranged numerous media trips to the contested border regions. During these visits, journalists were given the opportunity to interact with local residents who strongly dispute China\\'s claims and assert that their allegiance has always been to India. These efforts aim to showcase the perspective of the locals and highlight their unwavering support for India\\'s sovereignty over these areas.\\n\\nAn officer involved in the campaign, who preferred to remain anonymous, stated that the primary objective is to promote India\\'s counter-narrative regarding the disputed border. This would be achieved by leveraging regional and global media platforms and emphasizing both comprehensive historical research and the opinions of local residents. The aim is to establish a strong and credible narrative that supports India\\'s perspective on the border issue.\\n\\nIn an apparent attempt to reinforce its territorial claim over Arunachal Pradesh, China renamed 30 locations along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in India\\'s northeastern state in March. The Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs, responsible for naming administrative divisions, issued a list of \"standardized\" geographical names in Arunachal Pradesh, known as Zangnan in Beijing\\'s terminology. This move by China was reported by the South China Morning Post, a Hong Kong-based newspaper.\\n\\nChina\\'s renaming of locations in Arunachal Pradesh comprises a list that consists of 11 residential areas, 12 mountains, four rivers, one lake, one mountain pass, and a parcel of land. These new names are recorded in Chinese characters, Tibetan language, and pinyin, which is the Roman alphabet-based representation of Mandarin Chinese.\\n\\nQuoting the Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs, the South China Morning Post reported that the renaming of geographical names in Zangnan (Arunachal Pradesh) was carried out in accordance with regulations defined by China\\'s cabinet, the State Council. The ministry, in collaboration with other relevant departments, stated that they standardized certain geographical names in the region based on these provisions.\\n\\nChina\\'s decision to rename places in Arunachal Pradesh is not new, as this marks the fourth instance of such a unilateral action by Beijing. In 2017, the first list of six standardized names for locations in Arunachal Pradesh was released, followed by a second list in 2021 featuring 15 place names. In 2023, a third list was published, containing names for 11 places. However, the most recent fourth list is particularly significant, as it introduces nearly the same number of new place names as the previous three lists combined.\\n\\nIndia has consistently dismissed China\\'s attempts to rename places in Arunachal Pradesh, affirming that the state is an intrinsic component of the nation. India maintains that the act of assigning \"invented\" names does not change the underlying reality of Arunachal Pradesh\\'s status as an integral part of the country.\\n\\nIn 2023, the former spokesperson of India\\'s External Affairs Ministry, Arindam Bagchi, expressed the country\\'s response to the reports of China\\'s renaming efforts. He straightforwardly rejected China\\'s attempt, emphasizing that this was not the first time such actions were taken by China. India\\'s outright rejection asserts its stance on the matter, asserting that it does not accept the validity or legitimacy of China\\'s renaming endeavors.\\n\\nFurthermore, in response to China\\'s latest round of efforts to assert its claims on Arunachal Pradesh, India\\'s Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the region in March 2024. During his visit, he inaugurated the Sela Tunnel constructed at an elevation of 13,000 feet. Beijing responded by filing a diplomatic protest with India.\\n\\nAddressing China\\'s persistent claims on Arunachal Pradesh, India\\'s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar described them as \"ludicrous\" on March 23. He emphasized that the state was an inherent and natural part of India, firmly rejecting China\\'s assertions.\\n\\nRegarding the issue of Arunachal Pradesh, India\\'s External Affairs Minister responded that it is not a new matter. He highlighted that China\\'s claims and attempts to expand those claims are baseless and continue to be deemed as ludicrous. He made these remarks while addressing a question on the Arunachal issue during a lecture at the esteemed Institute of South Asian Studies at the National University of Singapore. The minister emphasized India\\'s steadfast position regarding the region\\'s status.\\n\\nIn addition, the External Affairs Minister reiterated India\\'s clear and unwavering stance on the matter, noting that it has remained consistent over time. He acknowledged that the issue of Arunachal Pradesh would be an integral part of the ongoing boundary discussions between the two countries. This statement reflects India\\'s commitment to address the matter within the context of bilateral dialogues. (IPA)',\n",

       "  'title': 'Be wary of US diplomacy setting traps in Asia - BLiTZ',\n",
       "  'body': 'The evolving geopolitical dynamics in Asia call for a nuanced understanding and cautious approach, especially in light of recent developments in Ukraine. Asian countries must remain vigilant against falling into a similar trap, one that appears to be set by the United States through its strategic maneuverings. The situation in Ukraine serves as a poignant reminder of the potential consequences of geopolitical entanglements, and Asia must tread carefully to avoid similar pitfalls.\\n\\nIn the past, the United States generally maintained a \"hands-off\" approach regarding territorial disputes in Asia. However, this stance has shifted significantly in recent years. Whenever a dispute involves China, the US invariably supports the opposing country, framing China as a regional \"bully\" and encouraging confrontation. This strategy is not dissimilar to the tactics employed in Eastern Europe, where NATO\\'s expansion and US influence have been pivotal in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.\\n\\nFor instance, the longstanding maritime disputes in the South China Sea have been exacerbated by US involvement. The friction between China and the Philippines, particularly over the grounded Philippine warship on Ren\\'ai Jiao since 1999, has been a focal point of tension. Despite China\\'s restraint, the US has emboldened the Philippines to adopt a more confrontational stance. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.\\'s actions and rhetoric, underpinned by US support, exemplify this shift. His recent speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue underscores this alignment, portraying the Philippines as a victim of Chinese aggression-a narrative strongly supported by the US.\\n\\nThe geopolitical landscape in Asia is far more intricate than in Europe, marked by numerous territorial disputes and maritime rights issues. Unlike Europe, Asia lacks a unified military alliance like NATO, and conflicts typically occur on a bilateral basis. However, the US seems intent on reshaping this dynamic by promoting a bloc mentality against China. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin\\'s remarks at the Shangri-La Dialogue, emphasizing the importance of alliances under the Indo-Pacific Strategy, clearly indicate this strategic direction.\\n\\nAustin\\'s denial of NATO\\'s role in the Ukraine crisis and his assertion that US security is intertwined with Asia\\'s stability reflect a broader agenda. The US aims to foster a coalition of Asian countries to counter China, replicating the NATO model. This strategy, if successful, could lead to increased regional tensions and potential conflicts, mirroring the situation in Europe.\\n\\nThe presence of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the Shangri-La Dialogue should serve as a stark warning to Asian nations. Ukraine\\'s current plight is a direct result of its entanglement with Western powers, particularly the US and NATO. While these alliances have provided support and assistance, it is ultimately the Ukrainian people who bear the brunt of the war. This scenario underscores the risks associated with aligning too closely with external powers, especially when it involves contentious regional disputes.\\n\\nAsian countries must heed this lesson and maintain strategic sobriety. The US\\'s portrayal of China as an aggressor and its efforts to galvanize regional opposition are part of a broader hegemonic strategy. It is crucial for Asian nations to recognize that while the US may offer support, it is ultimately driven by its own strategic interests, which may not align with the long-term stability and prosperity of the region.\\n\\nTo avoid falling into the same trap as Ukraine, Asian countries must adopt a balanced approach to their foreign policy. This involves engaging with all major powers while prioritizing regional stability and peaceful resolution of disputes. Diplomatic efforts should focus on bilateral negotiations and multilateral frameworks that include China as a key stakeholder.\\n\\nMoreover, regional organizations such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) can play a pivotal role in mediating disputes and fostering cooperation. By strengthening these institutions and promoting dialogue, Asian countries can mitigate external influences and maintain control over their own geopolitical destinies.\\n\\nChina, for its part, must also continue to demonstrate restraint and a commitment to peaceful resolution of disputes. By engaging in constructive dialogue and building trust with its neighbors, China can counter the narrative of being a regional bully and foster a more cooperative regional environment.\\n\\nThe geopolitical landscape in Asia is at a critical juncture, and the lessons from Ukraine are both relevant and urgent. Asian countries must be wary of US diplomatic strategies that seek to replicate the European model of alliances and confrontations. By maintaining strategic autonomy, promoting regional cooperation, and engaging in peaceful dispute resolution, Asia can avoid the pitfalls that have ensnared Ukraine. The path forward requires a balanced and nuanced approach, one that prioritizes long-term stability and prosperity over short-term geopolitical gains.',\n",

       "  'title': '越南在南海加速造岛 分析：中共霸凌遭反噬 - 大纪元',\n",
       "  'body': '【大纪元2024年06月12日讯】（大纪元记者宋唐、易如采访报导）自去年8月以来，中共针对南海争端海域采取的手段不断升级，加大了对南海周边的胁迫与骚扰力度，尤其是对菲律宾的攻击。但遭到各国反抗，越南在南海加速造岛，美日也增加介入南海的力度。\\n\\n中共霸凌遭反噬\\n\\n据《马尼拉时报》（The Manila Times）报导，从4月开始到5月结束的两周内，共有233艘中共船只出现在菲律宾专属经济区西菲律宾海。\\n\\n最紧张的地点仍然出现在仁爱礁（第二托马斯浅滩），自1999年以来一艘二战时期的登陆舰\"塞拉马德雷号\"一直搁浅在此，上面驻扎着一支菲律宾海军陆战队。近几个月来，中共行为变得极其鲁莽，每次菲律宾为仁爱礁提供补给时，都会定期派遣至少50艘船只绕过浅滩，使用高压水炮、声学设备和军用激光骚扰船员。\\n\\n尤其是5月19日，菲律宾军方向塞拉马德雷号进行空投时，中共海警船抢走了四袋物资中的一袋。\\n\\n中共近日又推出新规，自6月15日起实施为2021年发布的海警法而制定的具体执法措施，允许拘留\"非法\"入侵的外国人，允许海岸警卫队向外国船只开火。菲律宾国防部长回应说这是一种挑衅行为。\\n\\n中共在南海一系列凌霸、胁迫他国的行为，实际上已经起到反作用，激发世界各国反抗，一个反制中共的联盟隐约之间正在形成。\\n\\n去年年底，一直不轻易对华表态的东盟，对南海安全局势发表了看法，呼吁和平解决争端；越南、马来西亚和印度尼西亚都在大力推进自己的海上石油和天然气项目，同时加强了与菲律宾的海上安全合作。\\n\\n战略与国际研究中心（CSIS）一份新报告中称，自2023年11月以来，越南一直在加速南海填海造陆的进程，已在总共10个岛礁上填造280公顷的新陆地，差不多相当于前两年填海造陆面积的总和。\\n\\n其中，菲律宾总统小马科斯已经成为最直言不讳地挑战中共南海立场的领导人。自他上任以来，扩大了美军驻菲军事基地，今年4月份还史无前例地参加在华盛顿举行的首度美日菲峰会，同时菲律宾也将与日本签署《互惠准入协定》（RAA），允许部队在对方国家进行训练和演习。\\n\\n美菲还升级了有近四十年历史的\"肩并肩\"（Balikatan）联合军事演习，演习的范围和规模都在扩大，由过去只局限在吕宋岛到现在已遍布全菲，演习内容也从侧重于人道主义援助，发展到现在更为复杂的领土防御行动，并由南海延及到台海。\\n\\n今年4月份，数千名美菲士兵在南海海域演习收复一座岛屿并击沉一艘军舰，并在临近台湾的一个地点进行了空中侦察和后勤运输演习，并模拟占领了一座机场。\\n\\n菲律宾国家安全顾问爱德华多·阿诺（Eduardo Ano）5月24日表示，菲律宾已在距离台湾不到200公里的北部岛屿建造了一个海岸警卫站，增强了对中共军事存在监视的能力。\\n\\n在不久前香格里拉对话会上，小马科斯表示，如果有菲律宾公民在与中共海警日益激烈的冲突中丧生，就超越了红线，菲中对峙可能升级为战争。\\n\\n南海背后的美中之争\\n\\n国防安全研究院中共政军与作战概念研究所副研究员黄宗鼎告诉大纪元，东盟国家没有办法单独对抗中共，很长一段时间这些国家采取两手策略，直到小马科斯在今年开始强硬对抗，当然是跟美国的关系提升、美国给于小马科斯政府底气有直接关系。\\n\\n黄宗鼎认为，现在小马科斯之所以在南海显得对抗中共更加强硬，相当程度也发现与中共搁置争议并无法换来实质合作。\\n\\n\"中共长期以来的外交承诺都不可信任， 前菲律宾总统杜特尔特2018年跟北京达成一个南海联合开采协议，但此后中共在南海针对菲律宾的行动反而有加剧趋势。很明显菲律宾透过协议跟中共寻求搁置争议换取合作的算盘，其实是对中共严重的误判。在这种觉悟之下，小马科斯现在有相对强硬的动作。\"\\n\\n淡江大学国际事务与战略研究所副教授马准威告诉大纪元，中共对东南亚声索国，马来西亚跟印尼离中国比较远，主要透过一带一路在经济消融，但对越南跟菲律宾手段比较强硬。菲律宾跟越南很希望东盟有共同的南海协议，跟中共做抗衡，但东盟国家内部态度不一。结果产生第二选项，借助区域外国家主要是美国介入。\\n\\n马准威解释说，美国之所以会介入，首先是自由航行权是美国的一个基因，一百年前就这样了，所以美国不会让任何的国家去支配南海。另外西太平洋第一岛链对美国非常重要，会影响到整个太平洋上的安全，美国想办法拖延或阻绝中共往太平洋东边走。\\n\\n\"越南比较麻烦一点，一直有一个外交政策就是不选边，但是越南在硬的议题上包含北部湾，现在的反应也跟菲律宾有点像，找区域外大国合作，包括美国和法国。\"\\n\\n黄宗鼎认为，近期比较大的在南海的动作当然就是对菲律宾的，主要还是在于中美关系问题。\\n\\n他分析说，从去年初开始美国跟菲律宾升级EDCA（加强国防合作协议），菲律宾为美军提供四个新的军事基地，非常靠近巴士海峡。在北京的认知当中， EDCA的升级，等于是把美菲共同防御条约范围从南海延伸到台海。在这样的情况下，北京加强对菲律宾所占岛礁的军事跟政治的压力，操作一种围魏救赵的策略，企图缓解菲律宾跟美国的合作，降低菲律宾在台海有事的情况下，协助美军经营台海战场的意愿。\\n\\n中共维护政权 不是维护主权\\n\\n令人感到不解的是，如果中共真的在意领土主权，目标应该北部边境被俄国所侵占的几百万平方公里的领土。为什么偏偏为了几块微不足道的礁石费如此大的精力，招致如此多的国际谴责，并冒着引发直接冲突的风险呢？\\n\\n马准威认为，从外交策略来讲，中共在南海完全失败，周边邻国几乎没有国家支持它，引起更加的忌惮或更加联合，其实是非常大的一个败笔。\\n\\n台湾国家智库\"国防安全研究院\"钟志东博士告诉大纪元，中共把所谓南海主权的议题，拉高到好像涉及到国家存亡高度。这当然相当程度起到一种吓阻作用。但另一方面，产生的反作用力也会变大，变成了骑虎难下。\\n\\n\"实际产生了很大的负面效果，中共赤裸裸的展现了侵略性霸权，相当成功地团结了整个南海区域国家合作一致来反制中国（中共），坐实了中国（中共）不是和平崛起，中国（中共）是一个威胁。\"\\n\\n尽管中共主张缺乏国际法和海事法的支持，它不但建立了世界上最大的海岸警卫队，也违背了不会将人工岛礁变成军事基地、军事化南海的承诺。\\n\\n马准威介绍说，中共南海造人工岛，是从2012年中共18大以后开始的，当时制定了要海上\"走出去\"，军事扩张是必然的。南海岛礁建设最密集的时间是2013年到2017年。2015年9月习近平访美时候，奥巴马提出了南海不要军事化，中共填海造陆在同步进行，习当时用了一个漂亮的说法去包装，说填海造陆是为了科研，为了提供公共产品，不是军事化。\\n\\n钟志东表示，中共的话都不可信，这是这个政权的本质。谁要相信中共的话，最后下场都会很惨。因为它可以透过所谓的辩证法正反合，推翻自己过去的说法。最明显的例子就是说中英协议说香港50年不变，但现在全部变成一国一制。\\n\\n对于中共不去追究俄国的领土责任而计较于区区的南海岛礁，马准威认为，共产党的思维就是要联合次要敌人打击主要敌人，中俄之间没有真正的互信，但是现美国是它们共同的敌人。所以当中俄战略互相需要的时候，一些争议可以暂时搁置。\\n\\n他补充说，中共党魁第三任期没有一个正当性，在这种情况下，他没有安全感。包括针对台湾，他一直去强调主权完整性，其实某种程度是要塑造他自己的正当性。\\n\\n南海、台海 哪一个更危险？\\n\\n中共在南海一系列凌霸行为，包括驱赶渔船、用水炮攻击其它船只等，已经持续了至少十年。今年5月份在仁爱礁甚至发生持枪对峙的情形。北京在南海的不断侵略行为，有可能比台海更容易成为冲突的导火索。\\n\\n黄宗鼎表示，南海战术性的小规模的这个海上的对峙跟冲突的可能性，确实是比台海来得高许多。但中共现在比较清楚，中菲南海争端事实上还是中美问题，解决南海争端有效途径是透过对美外交的协调和沟通。\\n\\n\"台海整体局势要比南海宏观得多，中菲南海冲突只牵扯到美中菲三国，特定的岛礁短暂对峙。台海要复杂得多，成本代价也会非常高，牵涉到不只美中台，还包括高度使用台湾海峡作为商贸通道的相关国家，所以台海冲突一旦发生就会很严重，中共所付的代价也可能是相对地多很多，目前还是一个比较相对安全的状况。\"\\n\\n马准威认为，如果跟台海比的话，目前美中看起来是南海沟通管道畅通，南海上面的战争概率是不大的。台海现在的状况反而比较危险，台海双方虽然沟通，但存在分歧与变数。\\n\\n钟志东表示，台海跟南海，中共都视为其所谓核心利益所在，会采取军事行动来维持。但因为中共的能力现在还在准备之中，它尽量透过灰色地带达到想要达到的政治目标。\\n\\n\"中共有一个逻辑，就是运用冲突当作手段，然后达到政治目标。\"他说，这也可以证明，美国现在透过盟友和实力在相当程度上抑制了中共在南海的嚣张气势。\\n\\n责任编辑：林妍#',\n",

       "  'title': '倒计时最后3天，中国开始惩罚菲律宾，小马科斯要求菲军做好准备',\n",
       "  'body': '据中国海警官方确认，《海警机构行政执法程序规定》即将于6月15日起正式施行，这份新规带来的最大改变，它将授权中国海警部门在南海执法过程中，依法对非法闯入的船只和个人采取行政拘留措施。\\n\\n这也意味着，未来菲律宾在南海挑衅，尤其是在仁爱礁等区域的非法闯入，不再是被驱逐那么简单了，中国海警很有可能会采取登船执法等强硬行动。\\n\\n如今眼见着时间越来越临近，菲律宾这边也开始变得越来越沉不住气。\\n\\n就在6月10日，菲律宾总统小马科斯在考察伊莎贝拉省的军营期间，发表了一场内容十分敏感的演讲，其中提到了两个比较危险的观点。\\n\\n第一，小马科斯认为，菲律宾邻近于台湾，尤其是伊莎贝拉省位于菲律宾北部，与台湾隔海相望，因此一旦\"台海有事\"，菲律宾可能会受到波及。\\n\\n第二，小马科斯宣称南海的\"外部威胁\"变得更加突出，更加令人担忧，因此他要求菲律宾军队应该为任何可能的突发事件做好准备。小马科斯还罕见提到，中国在南海正在推出针对菲律宾的惩罚性措施。\\n\\n那么，中国具体对菲律宾推出了哪些惩罚性措施呢？实际上关于这个问题，我们在之前的视频节目中也聊到了不少，在这里我们不妨做一个整合。\\n\\n首先是在仁爱礁\"坐滩\"军舰的问题上，中方现在是对其进行了彻底封锁。\\n\\n就在本月初，菲律宾方面就多次炒作过中国阻挠菲律宾运送补给的消息，一方面，中方已经不再允许非法闯入的船只靠近\"坐滩\"军舰，菲律宾派出的补给船全部遭到了拦截；另一方面，菲律宾空投的补给，也被中方全部没收，因为菲律宾空投的准度不够，补给品通常只能扔到\"坐滩\"军舰附近的海里，再由菲方人员进行打捞，然而如今空投落下后，中方却抢先一步找到补给，并将其倒入海里。\\n\\n不仅如此，菲律宾还宣称，\"坐滩\"军舰上有伤员想要转移，也遭到了中方的阻拦。不过这个事情显然是菲律宾颠倒是非了，根据中国军网发布的通告，实际的情况是菲律宾企图以撤离非法\"坐滩\"军舰上的\"病人\"作掩护，趁机输送建筑物资来加固非法\"坐滩\"军舰。\\n\\n而且外交部发言人毛宁在回应时也提到，如果菲律宾真的想要转移受伤人员，那么应该提前向中方通报，中方基于人道主义的立场，会考虑同意菲方撤离相关人员。\\n\\n这也意味着，菲律宾\"坐滩\"军舰上的人员，现在面临着断水断粮的局面，如果菲律宾还要打着运送建筑物资的算盘，那么中方肯定是不介意继续采取封锁措施的。\\n\\n其次，中国对菲律宾的惩罚，还体现在经济上。\\n\\n菲律宾在南海的挑衅，不仅严重破坏了地区和平稳定，也破坏了中菲关系，影响了中菲经济合作的信心。\\n\\n截至2023年，中国已经连续8年成为菲律宾最大的贸易伙伴，中国也是菲律宾水果出口的最大市场，然而最新数据显示，今年1到4月份，中国从菲律宾进口水果的交易额同比下降了20%，其中菲律宾香蕉对华出口更是下降了三分之一，交易金额同比下降43.7%，而同期中国从越南进口的香蕉是菲律宾的两倍还多。\\n\\n当然，中方减少进口菲律宾产品，目前还只是民间的自发行为，如果菲律宾进一步挑衅，危及中国核心利益，一旦官方采取措施，那么菲律宾很有可能面临清零的窘境，这样的后果，小马科斯是否做好了准备呢？\\n\\n最后，针对菲律宾接下来可能的动作，我们也必须提高警惕。\\n\\n其一，是在台海问题上，菲律宾的立场已经开始动摇。\\n\\n小马科斯日前在香格里拉对话会上也承认，\"印太地区\"的安全离不开美国，而菲律宾和台湾都位于美国所谓的\"第一岛链\"上，在美国试图介入台海的背景下，小马科斯显然不会置身事外。\\n\\n因此菲律宾现在虽然在台湾问题上明面依然遵守一个中国原则，但实际上，菲律宾要介入台海的心思已经越来越活络。\\n\\n就在上个月，菲律宾国家安全顾问阿诺刚刚宣布，菲律宾已经在其邻近台湾的北方岛屿上建立了一个海岸警卫队哨所，这里距离台湾南部只有不到200公里，以便加强其对中国军事行动的监控能力。\\n\\n其二，在南海问题上，菲律宾可能采取更加激进的行动。\\n\\n小马科斯要求菲律宾军队为可能的突发事件做好准备，其中释放的信号已经非常危险。\\n\\n而且在仁爱礁的问题上，由于中国海警占据着绝对的主动权，菲律宾剩下的选择很少。\\n\\n现在菲律宾面临一个两难的抉择，如果提前向中方通报，仅仅是运送基本生活物资，的确能够保障\"坐滩\"军舰上人员的生活，但是如果不加紧运送建筑物资，这艘二战时期的军舰，随时都有解体的可能。\\n\\n但是运送建材物资又会触及中国的底线，因此菲律宾如果想要保住\"坐滩\"军舰，只能选择硬闯，因此必须加倍警惕菲律宾接下来在仁爱礁海域的非法活动，不能让菲律宾有可乘之机。',\n",

       "  'body': '【新唐人北京時間2024年06月12日訊】下面來看本期的國際聚焦。\\n\\n1、亨特·拜登非法持槍案被定罪 量刑細節未定\\n\\n6月11日，特拉華州威爾明頓的12人陪審團裁定亨特·拜登非法持槍案中的三項指控罪名全部成立，包括：向聯邦許可的槍支經銷商撒謊、在申請表上謊稱自己不是吸毒者以及非法持有槍枝11天等三項重罪。但法官沒有設定量刑日期，只是補充說時間通常在120天內。有法律專家表示，類似案件的被告往往會得到更短的刑期，並且可能不涉及監禁。\\n\\n2、菲律賓總統再表態：準備好應對外部威脅\\n\\n菲律賓總統府週二（6月11日）公布了小馬可斯總統前一天視察軍隊時的講話，他表示，必須準備好應對外部日益增長的威脅。小馬可斯近期針對中共在南海爭議區域的挑釁行為連續表態，日前在新加坡香格里拉對話會議期間，他不點名批評中國在南海採取「侵略行動」。為捍衛國家安全，菲律賓幾乎翻倍了美軍在該國可使用的軍事基地，而且也與美國在啟用美菲共同防禦條約上達成一致。\\n\\n3、朝鮮軍人越過韓朝軍事分界線 韓軍鳴槍警告\\n\\n據韓聯社報導，韓國聯合參謀本部6月11日發布消息指，當地時間9日中午十幾名朝鮮軍人一度越過了兩國軍事分界線，韓國軍隊進行警告射擊後對方撤回。近日，朝鮮頻繁向韓國發送裝滿垃圾和糞便的氣球，9日空投的垃圾氣球中有部分飄到接近韓國總統府區域，為防止污染擴散，韓國未採取擊落垃圾氣球的作法。有韓國民間團體開發了「智能氣球」飛向朝鮮，將真相傳單等傳遞到這個嚴密封閉的共產國家。\\n\\n4、馬拉維副總統座機失事 機上十人全部罹難\\n\\n東非國家馬拉維（Malawi）總統查克維拉（Lazarus Chakwera ）於當地時間6月11日宣布，副總統奇利馬（Saulos Chilima）乘坐的飛機殘骸在奇坎加瓦森林（Chikangawa Forest）中被發現，機上包括副總統在內的十人全部罹難；當晚遇難者遺體被運回首都里朗威（Lilongwe）。現年51歲的奇利馬被認為是明年總統大選的潛在參選人。奇利馬乘坐的飛機10日從首都起飛後從雷達上消失，原定目的地是該國北部的姆祖祖（Mzuzu）。\\n\\n本文網址: https://www.ntdtv.com/b5/2024/06/11/a103888626.html',\n",

       "  'body': '漫评丨把南海\"碰瓷\"当投名状，菲律宾却被美国当猴耍\\n\\n打\"激情牌\"强冲硬闯无效后，菲律宾又打起了\"悲情牌\"，指责中国海警\"阻止菲方一名生病的武装部队人员撤离仁爱礁\"，炒作什么中国海警的行为\"野蛮、不人道\"。实际情形却是，菲律宾企图以撤离非法\"坐滩\"军舰上的\"病人\"作掩护，趁机输送建筑物资来加固非法\"坐滩\"军舰，以达到继续赖在中国领土上不走的目的。对这种无赖的碰瓷行径，菲律宾不以为耻，反而在不同的场合或\"哭诉\"或\"硬拗\"。\\n\\n在香格里拉对话会上，菲律宾领导人一方面声称对南海\"抱有和平、稳定和繁荣的愿景\" ，自诩菲律宾是\"和平、法治、繁荣的典范\"，秉持\"国家间友好、博爱、主权平等的价值观\"；另一方面又罔顾历史和事实，宣扬其涉海错误立场，歪曲渲染海上事态，不断暗示中国在南海地区\"通过武力、恐吓和欺骗来宣扬毫无根据的主张\"，再次搬出所谓南海仲裁裁决承认菲律宾\"合法\"权利作为其南海政策的基石，以塑造自己在南海问题上\"守法者\"和\"受害者\"的角色。除了编造\"接运受伤人员\"谎言来遮掩偷运建材的企图外，在被曝光菲律宾船只上的人员用枪指着正在正常执法的中国海警后，菲军方发言人依然厚着脸皮说，菲律宾人员以\"最高水平的专业精神\"行事。\\n\\n再怎么\"碰瓷\"\"卖惨\"，再怎么胡搅蛮缠，也改变不了菲律宾在南海问题上不断侵权挑衅、激化矛盾的事实。多年来，菲律宾非法侵占中国南海岛礁，不断侵扰中国渔民的正常作业，对其生命财产安全构成了严重威胁，还借口舰船\"故障\"长期非法滞留在中国岛礁上。2016年的南海仲裁，更是菲律宾阿基诺政府在美西方国家一手操控下搞出的政治闹剧，不具备任何法律效力。菲律宾现政府重提南海仲裁，既是对《南海各方行为宣言》和一系列围绕解决争议所取得外交成果的无视，也是对《联合国海洋法公约》和国际关系准则的践踏，更是对中菲政治互信和两国人民感情的严重伤害。\\n\\n事实上，菲律宾上届政府执政期间，中菲双方就仁爱礁局势管控商谈达成了\"君子协定\"。\"君子协定\"目的是管控局势，维护和平，防止冲突，无关各自主权立场。\"君子协定\"也不是秘密协定。菲律宾现政府上台后，中方向菲政府高层多次通报和交涉\"君子协定\"有关事宜，并且始终坚持通过对话协商与菲方寻找管控分歧的办法。事实上，直到2023年2月初，即菲律宾现政府上台后7个月，中菲双方有关部门和机构一直都遵守这一协定，有效确保了仁爱礁局势和平稳定。然而，菲律宾却揣着明白装糊涂，违背自身承诺和中菲共识，出尔反尔、背信弃义。中国去年邀请菲总统对华特别事务特使赴华就仁爱礁局势管控进行磋商达成内部谅解，今年初又通过外交渠道与菲军方反复商谈达成仁爱礁运补\"新模式\"。有关谅解和安排均在实施一次后，被菲律宾单方面无故抛弃。\\n\\n菲律宾除了频繁在海上侵权挑衅、制造事端外，还伙同域外势力在南海拉帮结派、炫耀武力，甘愿充当其干涉地区事务的急先锋、马前卒。虽然多次强调要\"以东盟为中心\"，但\"说一套做一套\"的菲律宾却热衷于在东盟机制外另起炉灶，不仅不顾地区国家的整体利益，违反东盟宪章精神，配合\"外部势力\"在本地区部署中程导弹，还与美国、日本、澳大利亚等域外国家大搞军事联盟和排华小多边圈子，并频频举行联合军演。继4月美日菲三国首脑在华盛顿举行三边会谈后，菲日两国还计划7月在马尼拉召开外交和防卫部长级\"2+2\"会谈，以强化两国的安全保障合作。\\n\\n菲律宾以域外势力为靠山，殊不知已沦为美西方国家为制造地缘动荡、打压\"竞争对手\"而选中的棋子。菲律宾寄希望于美国在经济上给予回报，美国也确实先后提出所谓\"10亿美元投资\"\"吕宋经济走廊\"等合作动向，但菲律宾人的预期和面对的现实仍然存在巨大落差 -- --\\n\\n2019年时，美国就是菲律宾第六大投资来源国。2022年11月，美国副总统哈里斯访问菲律宾，除强调美菲同盟\"坚若磐石\"外，还承诺加强对菲律宾的经济与投资合作。在美菲\"2+2\"会议上，双方进一步确认将深化双边贸易与投资等领域的合作，菲律宾将参加美国\"印太经济伙伴框架\"下4个项目的合作。菲律宾总统马科斯访美期间，美国总统拜登表示要向菲派出总统贸易与投资代表团，提升美国公司对菲多个领域的投资。然而，美国作为东盟最大的投资来源国，2023年总投资金额高达370亿美元，对菲律宾的投资额仅有8735万美元（约51.31亿比索），依然是菲律宾第六大投资来源国，但投资额不及排名第三的日本（574亿比索）的零头，日本又不及排名前两位的德国（3940亿比索）、荷兰（3499亿比索）的零头。这些数字活生生地说明，菲律宾无非是美国为了分摊战略成本临时拉来的\"马仔\"，一句\"尚需国会批准\"就成了拜登政府对菲经贸合作口惠而实不至的最好借口。经济承诺尚且如此，安全承诺又会如何呢？菲律宾人还真把美国佬的话当真吗？',\n",

       "  'body': '一招制敌，不给日本可乘之机！中国海警钓鱼岛出手，今后不再警告\\n\\n不给日本任何可乘之机，海警用行动表明，中国能够应对多方挑衅。近段时间以来，中国周边形势愈发复杂，解放军和海警部队需要在台海震慑\"台独\"分裂势力的同时，还要在南海应对美菲同盟对中国南沙岛礁主权的挑衅。中方为应对周边复杂形势四处出击，让某些国家以为有了可乘之机，因而都想趁火打劫占中国的便宜。\\n\\n日本就是其中一个最显眼的国家，在南海局势动荡之际，日本对中国钓鱼岛主权的挑衅也变得更加频繁。不过，中国海警用实际行动告诉对手：门都没有！据红星新闻报道，6月10日，中国海警2401舰艇编队在我国钓鱼岛领海内巡航，这是中国海警依法开展的维权巡航活动。\\n\\n中国海警持续不断在钓鱼岛领海内巡航维权的背景，就是上月多名日本右翼政客打着所谓\"调查团\"的幌子，乘坐渔船进入我国钓鱼岛附近海域进行\"视察\"。这也就算了，这些政客还透过媒体叫嚣，日本相关组织应该\"登岛视察\"。当然，在中国海警的面前，这些政客打打嘴炮可以，但不大可能有胆量玩真的。至少，他们连钓鱼岛的领海都无法靠近，哪来的底气\"登岛视察\"？\\n\\n钓鱼岛自古以来就是中国固有的领土，无论是日本政客还是日本渔民，在未经中方允许的情况下靠近钓鱼岛领海，就是对中国领海主权的侵犯，必将遭到海警强有力的反制。对此，外交部发言人指出：中方强烈敦促日方停止一切政治挑衅、现场滋事和舆论炒作，回到通过对话协商妥善管控矛盾分歧的正确轨道上来。\\n\\n中国在东海主权问题上的寸步不让，令日本某些右翼政客感到很无奈，打又打不过，想就此放弃又不甘心。因此，日本政府近年来一直插手台海局势，频繁发表不当言论给民进党当局释放错误信息，其中的一个主要动机，就是企图挑起台海紧张局势，分散中国的战略关注重心，为其在钓鱼岛问题上占中国便宜创造机会。\\n\\n另外，日本近年来还热衷于随从美国支持菲律宾。在美国没有意愿向菲律宾提供军事援助的情况下，日本\"慷慨解囊\"，不但为菲律宾海岸警卫队提供可起降直升机的巡逻船。另外，日本去年还以经济援助的方式，向菲律宾\"白送\"多套对海警戒雷达系统。日本这一系列的做法，表面上看是在协助美国增强菲律宾军队对抗中国的实力，其实就是希望鼓动菲律宾在南海问题上兴风作浪，以此来牵制中国的战略重心。\\n\\n所以，在中菲南海主权争端愈演愈烈、以及台海新一轮危机爆发之际，日本针对中国钓鱼岛的挑衅侵权活动变得非常频繁。不过，无论是日本政府还是右翼政治势力，都需要搞清楚的是，中国不但有能力应对来自台海和南海的危机，同时还有足够的能力收拾在东海方向挑衅侵权的日本政客。\\n\\n在最近几天，中国海警1102，1103与1302号三艘海警船依然在钓鱼岛海域进行巡航，围绕钓鱼岛进行24小时不间断巡航，并控制其西北航路，这已经表明我国在钓鱼岛海域将会进行常态化巡航。而随着中国海警力量的不断壮大，日本海上力量与中国在钓鱼岛海域显然是有些疲于奔命。\\n\\n事实上，日本某些政客如果不是信息堵塞的话，就应该从近期的新闻中领教到中方的实力。在新一轮台海危机爆发后，解放军在台岛周边举行的大规模军演，不但将演习范围扩大到岛链内外，同时还新增\"阻敌\"这一演练科目。这说明解放军完全有能力在收拾\"台独\"势力的同时，还可以让任何试图军事介入台海局势的外部势力有来无回。\\n\\n中国同时应对多方危机的实力就摆在那儿了，日本想要通过在其他方走向制造危机等手段，削弱中国在东海方向维权的实力和决心，那是在痴人说梦话。而中国海警执法船在钓鱼岛常态性的巡航维权活动，实际上就已经足以打掉日本觊觎钓鱼岛的非分幻想了。',\n",

       "  'title': '越南加量填土，中资订单已转移，南海生变后果很严重',\n",
       "  'body': '当地时间6月7日，距离中国海警新规生效还剩9天，美国一家智库机构发布了一份调查报告，显示在过去半年的时间里，越南在南沙群岛附近海域填海造陆的面积达到了280公顷，这相当于过去两年时间里填海造陆的一个总和。据不完全统计，截止到目前，越南在南海地区填海造陆和海底挖泥的总面积已经达到了955公顷，而在三年前这一数值只有133公顷。换句话说，在过去三年的时间里，越南填海造陆的速度呈倍数增长，大有与中国一较高低的架势，中方目前填海造陆的总面积达到了1881公顷。但有两个方面需要着重声明一下：第一，中国在自家领海范围内填海造陆并没有任何不妥，轮不到其他国家来指手画脚。第二，为了加速《南海行为准则》的落实，早在数年前中国就停止了填海造陆行动，作为缓和紧张局势所拿出来的诚意和态度。\\n\\n很显然，越南是趁着中国停止填海造陆之后，才加快自己的\"扩建\"计划，其妄图非法侵占中国南海领土的野心已经暴露的一览无余了。目前，越南是非法侵占中国岛礁最多的一个南海国家，其中柏礁更被外界视为越南\"对抗中国的前线进攻基地\"。在过去半年的时间里，这处岛礁的面积扩大了近一倍，达到了167公顷。除了修建机场跑道以外，越南还计划在该岛礁上修建多处港口码头，增加岛礁上的军事部署，以强化越南对于南海地区的\"监控\"。毫无疑问，越南与菲律宾一样并不打算在南海问题上与中国相向而行了，只是越南并没有菲律宾那边张扬，一直悄悄摸摸的展开自己的非法侵占行动，从而实现永久侵占的目的。有消息称，越南每年从南海地区非法窃取的油气资源超过了300亿美元，其中很大一部分被用于越南国防军事的现代化发展。\\n\\n就现阶段的情况来看，越南摆明了是打算循环这一\"发展模式\"，即不断侵占中国南海岛礁，获得更多的资源红利，推动本国军事力量的发展，再去不断扩大自己的侵占速度。外界也注意到，在美国智库公布报告的前一天，越南方面主动将矛头对准中国，宣称中国正在\"越南海域\"内展开非法调查活动，要求立即停止这一\"错误行为\"。到底是不是越南海域，到底是不是非法调查活动，越南心里其实很清楚。这种故意混淆视听，妄图利用外部势力干涉来非法索取南海主权的举动，自然不会得到国际社会的支持。值得一提的是，目前中国不少企业和资本正在加大对越南的经济投资，并且有很多订单从菲律宾转移到越南，在一定程度上推动越南经济社会的发展。但是现在越南一边享受中国所带来的经济红利，一边却在不断侵占中国领土主权，属实是\"吃饭砸锅\"。\\n\\n虽然中方一再强调\"搁置争议，共同开发\"，但前提条件是必须尊重中国在南海地区的领土主权，对于任何试图触碰中方核心利益的错误行为，中方都不会选择忍让。在6月15日，中国海警新规将正式生效，这就意味着对于任何不请自来的外国船只和不法分子，中国海警部门都可以依法展开维权行动，除了常规的拦阻驱离以外，还可以进行扣押和审查，最长期限将达到60天。并且解放军海军也开始在南海地区展开常态化的巡航部署和军事演练，这一警告信号非常清晰，最终如何选择就得看南海各国的政治智慧了。',\n",

       "  'body': '菲律宾近期不断在南海寻衅滋事，甚至将自己打造成所谓 \" 受害者 \"，妄图在国际舆论中混淆视听。对此，中方连续发布视频以正视听，打脸菲方碰瓷行径。但菲律宾国家安全顾问阿诺仍大放厥词，声称菲方会继续在南海执行补给任务，且无须事先征求任何国家许可。\\n\\n中方一连两天发布海警执法现场影像 有力回击菲方不实指控\\n\\n菲律宾海岸警卫队 7 日指责中方海警，在上月 19 日的相关行动中，阻止菲方一名 \" 患病武装部队人员 \" 撤离仁爱礁，声称中国海警进行了危险操作，故意撞击该军人乘坐的菲方海军船只，行为 \" 野蛮且不人道 \"。\\n\\n针对此事，中方连续两天通过媒体发布现场照片和视频，反驳菲方指控，批评菲方歪曲事实，虚假叙事，企图误导国际认知。\\n\\n中新社 8 日发布的视频显示，当时菲方海警正向非法 \" 坐滩 \" 仁爱礁军舰进行人员轮换、物资补给，而中国海警则依法依规，全程跟监管控菲方船只。视频中，菲律宾海岸防卫队船上人员将物资交给另一艘快艇上的人员。菲方船头、船尾均放置大量物资，人员或站或坐，未见任何明显受伤者在场。而插着中国国旗的中国海警船只，在数米开外跟监管控，完全不存在菲方叙述中的 \" 野蛮、不人道 \" 撞击行为。\\n\\n中新社发布的视频显示，菲海岸防卫队船上人员将物资交给另一艘快艇上的人员，且未见任何明显受伤者在场。\\n\\n《环球时报》7 日发布的图片则从更多角度清晰展现，菲方此次出动其军用高速冲锋艇参与运补，艇上乘坐的都是状态良好的菲军方人员，为了能够携带更多非法运补物资，一些军方人员甚至选择站立在颠簸的冲锋舟上，把座位腾出来用于装载物资。\\n\\n《环球时报》7 日援引专业人士分析指，菲方出动的军用冲锋艇最快航速能达到 40-50 节，菲方采用这种 \" 小、快、灵 \" 的装备参与非法运补活动本就凸显其执意对抗、躲避中国海警依法维权执法的意图。（图源：中国海警）\\n\\n菲律宾资深媒体人黄栋星在接受深圳卫视直新闻采访时表示，中方最近所发布的一系列中国海警执法视频和图片，是把事实公之于众，让国际社会知道是谁在南海挑衅滋事。在这些事实面前，菲方想狡辩也无从下手。\\n\\n深圳卫视直新闻注意到，自菲律宾总统马科斯月初在新加坡举行的香格里拉对话会上发表主旨演讲，试图通过在国际舆论场上 \" 卖惨 \" 以博取眼球以来，中菲双方已进行数轮舆论交锋。中方通过新华社、中国国际电视台、《环球时报》、知名微信公众号 \" 玉渊谭天 \"、中新社等具有影响力的媒体，向国际社会发布上月 15 日、19 日的海警执法现场视频，证明菲律宾非法 \" 坐滩 \" 仁爱礁军舰上人员，确有枪指中国海警、偷窃中方渔民的渔网的行为。相关照片和视频证据也显示，中国海警的操作依法依规，菲方的指控纯属污蔑。\\n\\n菲国安顾问又挑事 妄称补给 \" 坐滩舰 \" 不会通报\\n\\n而菲律宾方面则不断召开记者会，颠倒黑白地 \" 卖惨 \"\" 碰瓷 \"。对此，中国外交部 7 日重申，中方在仁爱礁问题上的立场是明确的。如果菲方提前通报，中方可以允许菲方向 \" 坐滩 \" 军舰运送必要的生活物资以及撤离相关人员，但是，菲方不得以此为借口向 \" 坐滩 \" 军舰运送建筑材料，图谋永久侵占仁爱礁。\\n\\n菲律宾国家安全顾问阿诺（图源：美联社）\\n\\n但菲律宾方面仍然一意孤行，菲律宾国家安全顾问阿诺 8 日再次大放厥词，妄称菲律宾对仁爱礁 \" 拥有主权和管辖权 \"，\" 菲方永远不需要中国批准我们在这里展开任何活动 \"。\\n\\n值得注意的是，菲律宾国安顾问一般是总统亲自任命的亲密幕僚，可以直接影响本国的外交和安全政策。阿诺是军人出身，曾担任菲军总参谋长，是菲军方在总统府内的利益代表。他还是一名不折不扣的 \" 亲美派 \"，有在美受训的军事背景，主张在南海问题上与美国合作以对抗中国。深圳卫视直新闻注意到，阿诺自去年就任菲国安顾问以来，频繁冲在中菲南海舆论交锋第一线。\\n\\n去年 12 月，为配合菲政府宣传，探明中国海上力量情况，阿诺登上在南海被菲律宾非法侵占的中业岛，参加菲海岸警卫队的一场典礼，相关举动遭到菲律宾媒体的批评。菲媒当时报道说，阿诺刚一登岛，包括一艘中国海警巡逻船和一艘中国海军军舰在内的 10 多艘中国船只在周围巡逻以示警告，阿诺贸然登岛行动，无疑升高对抗和冲突风险。\\n\\n前不久，中菲官员达成仁爱礁菲方坐滩船只运补 \" 新模式 \" 的通话记录被公开，阿诺作为菲方指挥链条中的一环，对于 \" 新模式 \" 完全知情，但他却翻脸不认，声称菲中在仁爱礁问题上 \" 没有达成任何协议 \"，不存在所谓 \" 君子协定 \"。不仅如此，阿诺还叫嚣要驱逐掌握与菲律宾官员通话录音的中国外交官，相关表态遭到中方批评，\" 气急败坏且毫无底线 \"。\\n\\n菲律宾在南海频繁挑衅 离不开美国背后操盘\\n\\n深圳卫视直新闻注意到，今年以来，从组织公务船 \" 强行非法闯礁 \"，到编造所谓 \" 中国渔民在黄岩岛使用氰化物 \" 谎言，再到菲总统马科斯明确要求菲海岸警卫队及渔业与水产资源局船只轮流部署，以及炮制所谓 \" 民间组织百船闯岛 \" 闹剧，菲律宾在南海问题上穷尽心思、变本加厉。\\n\\n这是 5 月 16 日拍摄的菲律宾非法 \" 坐滩 \" 军舰上人员在整理盗得的中国渔民的渔网。（图源：新华社）\\n\\n而这一切与美国的指导和部署密不可分。菲律宾在美国指导下采取 \" 灰色地带战略 \"，上个月一个自称 \" 民间组织 \" 的 \" 这是我们的 \" 联盟号召 200 多人试图冲闯中国黄岩岛附近海域。一位菲律宾观察家披露，发起 \" 这是我们的 \" 联盟，是美国斯坦福大学推出的 \" 妙手计划 \" 和美国海军学院发起的 \" 点亮海上灰色地带 \" 行动的一部分，幕后的 \" 操盘手 \" 依然是美国。在美国金主和马科斯政府的策划和煽动下，\" 这是我们的 \" 联盟在黄岩岛及其他海域多次兴风作浪。去年 12 月，正是这个联盟组织的所谓 \" 圣诞慰问 \" 引起了仁爱礁和黄岩岛局势的骤然升温。\\n\\n菲律宾资深媒体人黄栋星向深圳卫视直新闻分析指，正是由于得到美国虚幻的安全承诺、大量二手武器输送，加上美国在菲律宾的渗透和影响，马科斯政府甘愿在地区事务上扮演美国霸权的鹰犬角色。\\n\\n需要指出的是，菲方以为有美国撑腰就可以胡作非为，完全是不切实际的幻想。外界注意到，月初在新加坡举行的 \" 香会 \" 期间，美国国防部长奥斯汀面对菲律宾提出的触发《美菲共同防御条约》的问题时，没有作出明确回应，而是强调美国将加强与中国的对话，以确保不会发生这样的情况。舆论广泛认为，美方含蓄表达了不值得为菲方与中国发生直接冲突的想法。\\n\\n黄栋星指出，虽然美国现在利用菲律宾的地缘优势、极力拉拢菲律宾，但并不意味着美国会为了菲律宾的利益 \" 去跟中国打一场战争 \"，尤其是现在为了配合拜登的选举连任目的，美方现在是想法设法要跟中国互动，所以在这样的背景下，美国更不会为菲律宾而战。\\n\\n图源：法新社\\n\\n实际上，马科斯政府在南海不断寻衅滋事，导致中菲关系恶化，是搬起石头砸自己的脚。根据中国海关总署公布的最新数据，今年前 4 个月，菲律宾向中国出口的香蕉在数量上减少三分之一，从而把多年来一直把持的中国最大香蕉进口来源国的位置拱手让给越南。\\n\\n多年来，菲律宾香蕉一直在数量上占据着中国进口香蕉的霸主地位。数据显示，2018 年和 2019 年是菲律宾香蕉向中国出口的高峰期，年出口量超过 100 万吨。一直到 2022 年和 2023 年，菲律宾香蕉仍占据年度第一的位置，但领先优势被越南香蕉不断追赶和缩小，并在今年前 4 个月被越南大幅超越。\\n\\n除气候以及价格等原因外，地缘政治因素是菲律宾香蕉出口中国锐减的重要原因。有水果贸易从业者直言，由于菲律宾频繁挑衅导致中菲南海问题不断升温，中国消费者中有相当部分人群不愿再购买菲律宾香蕉。中国经销商决定减少对菲律宾香蕉的进口以防止滞销风险。观察指出，菲律宾当局采取极端、非建设性的态度来处理对华关系，导致在中国这个全球最大农产品进口市场失去信任，结果得不偿失。\\n\\n作者丨万涵一，深圳卫视直新闻主笔\\n\\n编辑丨杨颖，深圳卫视直新闻主编\\n\\n排版丨郑志佳，深圳卫视直新闻编辑\\n\\n本文章版权属于 \" 直新闻 \"，未经授权不得转载。',\n",

       "  'body': '新华社万象6月9日电 6月7日至8日，外交部副部长孙卫东率团赴老挝出席东盟与中日韩（10+3）高官会、东亚峰会高官会和东盟地区论坛高官会。孙卫东在会后接受媒体采访时表示，刚刚结束的东亚合作系列高官会上，地区国家就当前形势下把握东亚机制发展正确方向、推进各领域务实合作等深入交流，达成广泛共识，为今年东亚合作领导人系列会议和外长会做准备。会议还就巴以冲突、乌克兰危机、朝鲜半岛、缅甸、气候变化、网络安全、人工智能等国际地区热点问题和新兴领域合作交换了意见。中方阐述了在有关问题上的原则立场，对美西方涉华谬论予以严正驳斥。\\n\\n孙卫东表示，东盟与中日韩（10+3）是东亚合作主渠道，各方积极评价《10+3合作工作计划（2023－2027）》落实进展，支持深化财金、粮食安全、电动汽车、数字经济、绿色经济、社会人文等领域合作，高质量实施《区域全面经济伙伴关系协定》，加强区域供应链联通。东亚峰会是领导人引领的战略论坛，各方普遍支持发挥峰会作用，推动政治安全和经济发展\"两个轮子\"平衡转动，促进建设性对话交流，拓展新兴领域合作。东盟地区论坛是亚太最主要的多边安全对话与合作平台，各成员强调，要继续推进建立信任措施，深化务实合作，稳步开展预防性外交，为地区持久和平作出积极贡献。\\n\\n在谈及与会各方就国际地区形势和热点敏感问题进行讨论时，他指出，高官会上，中方强调亚太是和平发展的高地，支持东盟中心地位，支持以东盟方式推进区域安全合作，支持以和平手段解决分歧和争端，呼吁树立平等、合作的安全理念。中方重申坚持协商一致、照顾各方舒适度等原则，丰富合作议题，积极应对网络安全、气候变化、人工智能等新兴挑战，维护共同安全利益。中方明确支持以东盟为中心的区域安全架构，坚持开放共赢理念，兼顾各方诉求，包容各方利益，构建均衡、有效、可持续的区域安全架构，而不是另起炉灶，搞封闭排他的小圈子、小集团。\\n\\n孙卫东强调，关于南海问题，中方指出，目前南海的最大安全挑战来自域外，以美国为首的域外势力从地缘政治目的出发，操弄集团政治和阵营对抗，推进在南海军事部署和行动，挑唆激化涉海分歧和矛盾，损害沿岸国正当权益。中国对南海诸岛拥有无可争辩的主权，致力于按照\"双轨思路\"，同南海当事国通过对话协商妥善管控争议；同东盟国家全面有效落实《南海各方行为宣言》，积极推动\"南海行为准则\"磋商不断取得新进展，共同维护南海和平稳定大局。\\n\\n针对美国在本地区部署中程导弹系统，中方指出，美方做法将本地区拉入军备竞赛漩涡，将整个亚太地区置于地缘冲突的阴影之下，严重开历史倒车，严重危害地区国家安全，严重破坏地区和平稳定。中方坚决反对冷战思维和阵营对抗，坚决反对任何域外势力在本地区挑起军备竞赛，坚决反对将地区国家当作霸权工具和地缘战略\"棋子\"。\\n\\n他表示，东盟等与会方普遍强调，要和平不要战乱、要对话不要对抗、要团结不要分裂，呼吁加强互利合作、促进共同发展，携手维护东亚地区长期和平稳定这一来之不易的良好局面。和平、发展、合作、共赢是亚洲地区人心所向、大势所趋，地区国家应共同为此作出积极努力。',\n",
