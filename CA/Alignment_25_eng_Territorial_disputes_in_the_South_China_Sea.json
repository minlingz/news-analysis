        "body": "Pham Van Coung, a director of Pho Noi Power Station, works at the Pho Noi Power Station, a state utility owned by Electricity of Vietnam, in Hung Yen province, Vietnam, on June 4, 2024. Reuters\n\nLights are off and air conditioning is down at the headquarters of Vietnam's state-run electricity provider EVN as the country's top power utility tries to \"lead by example\" to avoid a repeat of last year's crippling blackouts, an official tells visitors. But many businesses around Vietnam's capital Hanoi appear to be ignoring the call to conserve power, keeping decorative but otherwise purposeless neon lights on the outside of high-rise buildings on all night. The difficulties in curtailing consumption illustrate the challenges facing Vietnam a year after sudden outages caused losses of hundreds of millions of dollars to multinational manufacturers with investments in the Southeast Asian country.\n\nVietnam is pursuing a patchwork agenda of energy-saving measures, grid upgrades, regulatory reforms and a massive increase of coal power as it seeks to avert electricity shortfalls, according to government data and interviews with officials and experts. But Trinh Mai Phuong, EVN's communications director, explains during a media visit that even the biggest infrastructure upgrade underway, a new $1 billion transmission line connecting the centre of the country to the highly industrialised north that was hard hit by blackouts last year, may not be enough.\n\n\"I would not say it is a game changer,\" Phuong said of the line that could be completed as early as this month, noting\n\nit is one of many measures needed amid multiple issues to address. Power consumption for instance is expected to hit record highs in the coming weeks as the country braces for more heatwaves, he said.\n\nThe soaring power demand is making it increasingly difficult for Vietnam to meet climate change commitments while providing enough power to satisfy large investors such as Samsung Electronics, Foxconn and Canon.\n\nBroader sector-wide reforms are needed over the longer term, foreign investors and analysts said.\n\nIn the short term, Vietnam is banking mostly on coal to provide enough reliable electricity. It may be just enough - or not - but either way it may signal a blow to the country's commitments to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nCoal use rose massively in the first five months of 2024, with coal-fired power plants accounting on average for 59% of electricity output, exceeding 70% some days, according to EVN data.\n\nThat was up from nearly 45% in the same period last year and 41% in 2021, when Vietnam began drafting plans to cut coal that persuaded international donors to commit $15.5 billion to help phase out the fuel.\n\nThanks to a new coal-fired power plant that came online in 2023, coal accounted for 33% of total installed capacity last year, up from 30.8% in 2020, taking Vietnam further away from the goal of lowering that to 20% by 2030.\n\nEnergy conservation is another key pillar of the plan. EVN and its local units have encouraged energy-hungry clients, including foreign manufacturers, to save power with tailored measures, especially in peak hours.\n\nBut that risks Vietnam's reputation as a reliable place for investment and could affect future manufacturing expansion plans, according to foreign investors who declined to be named because they were not authorised to talk to media.\n\nThe matter should be addressed by solving generation and distribution issues, and not from the consumption side, two foreign investors said.\n\nVietnam's industry ministry did not reply to a request for comment. Vietnam is using only a fraction of its installed solar and onshore wind capacity due largely to administrative hurdles.\n\nIt has not approved regulations to kick-start offshore wind projects and delays dog projects to build power plants fuelled by imported liquefied natural gas, which is cleaner than coal. The four energy sources together should account for more than 40% of installed capacity by 2030, according to the government's plans, though analysts are sceptical. Hydropower is projected to fall to less than 20% of installed power generation by the end of decade from more than 30% in 2020.\n\nBut some capacity is being added in the north where needs are higher.\n\nOne of Vietnam's largest hydropower plants at Hoa Binh is adding two General Electric turbines to its existing eight, which will boost its total capacity to 2.4 gigawatts from less than 2 GW now by the second half of 2025, said Dao Trong Sang, EVN's manager of the expansion project, during a visit to the dam. The Hoa Binh plant, combined with the new transmission line that brings electricity to the north from separate plants, may add 8% capacity to the power-hungry north.\n\nThe power crisis cannot be solved without long-awaited reforms, experts say, though progress to date has been slow.\n\nIn April, the industry ministry issued an updated methodology for determining electricity prices, a step towards possibly reviving projects stuck for years because of a lack of clarity about tariffs.\n\nHowever, the methodology could force developers to shoulder excessive risk, complicating their access to finance, said a Vietnam-based official who declined to be named because they were not authorised to talk to media. A separate draft decree enabling manufacturers to buy electricity directly from producers is seen as close to approval after years of internal debate, according to several analysts. The use of direct power purchase agreements (DPPAs) could make it easier for multinational companies to avoid higher tariffs on exports and boost the use of renewables to help them meet environmental, social and governance requirements.\n\nBut the DPPA rules need to be combined with other reforms, such as clearer provisions to directly connect factories to power-generation projects, the official said.\n\nMeanwhile, Vietnamese President To Lam on Tuesday told Chinese ambassador to Hanoi Xiong Bo it was important that maritime disputes were managed well and each country's interests were respected, his office said in a statement. China is Vietnam's largest trading partner, but the two Communist-ruled neighbours have been embroiled in a years-long maritime dispute in the South China Sea. Lam said at a meeting in Hanoi that the countries needed to respect each other's legitimate interests, the statement said. The two sides need to \"actively seek satisfactory solutions in accordance with international law,\" Lam said in the meeting. On Thursday, the foreign ministry had said it was deeply concerned over the presence of a Chinese survey vessel in Vietnam's exclusive economic zone.\n\nIn Tuesday's meeting, Lam said developing friendship and cooperation with China was Vietnam's strategic choice and a priority in its foreign policies. Vietnam and China signed dozens of cooperation agreements, including on railways, during a visit to Hanoi by Chinese President Xi Jinping in December. Lam reiterated the need to boost railway connectivity between the two countries in the meeting, and asked China to further open its market for Vietnamese farm products.",

The People's Liberation Army released images boasting its ability to rain missiles on one of the most densely populated countries in the world as \"strong punishment.\"\n\nDemocracy under threat\n\nBeijing's standard reaction to the democratic voting rights of 24 million people is to threaten to \"break skulls and let blood flow.\" For China, Taiwan as a renegade province that must \"return to the embrace of the motherland\" despite the fact China does not have any authority over Taiwan.\n\nIn recent years, China has been trying to use its diplomatic clout and influence at the United Nations to rewrite history and legitimize its claim of sovereignty over Taiwan.\n\nWhile Taiwan ranks highly on the Human Freedom Index (just one spot ahead of Canada), China is a techno-authoritarian state that has regressed even further under the reign of Xi Jinping.\n\nMillions of Uyghur Muslims remain in re-education and forced labour camps, while Tibetans are forced to \"Sinicize\" and lose their cultural and religious heritage.\n\nReaching beyond borders\n\nPolitical dissidents, journalists and foreign nationals are not immune from intimidation or imprisonment.\n\nIn what has been termed transnational oppression, aided through Chinese so-called police stations operating with impunity overseas, the Chinese government targets and threatens Chinese nationals and critics of China wherever they are.\n\nRead more: New commission sheds light on how diaspora communities are impacted by foreign interference\n\nMany governments, including Canada's, caution against travel to China and Hong Kong due to the \"risk of arbitrary enforcement\" of laws prohibiting activities or speech critical of the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nChina's censorship, surveillance and arbitrary arrests are widespread, and such tactics and technologies are alarmingly being exported worldwide.\n\nWhile the Chinese government condemns the forced divestment of TikTok, the app -- together with Facebook, WhatsApp and Google -- are all banned within the great firewall of China.\n\nWar games\n\nWhen former United States House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in 2022, China conducted similar war games.\n\nRead more: Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan causes an ongoing Chinese tantrum in the Taiwan Strait\n\nIncursions by Chinese warships and fighters into Taiwan's Air Defence Identification Zone are increasing in frequency. In addition, short of mounting an invasion, China is increasingly testing the waters by deploying its maritime militia to swarm islands under Taiwan's control.\n\nKnown as \"grey-zone\" tactics, they fall short of the use of force, which is prohibited under international law. Also referred to as \"salami slicing,\" grey-zone tactics that are not strictly attacks make it hard for others to respond without potentially escalating a situation to a conflict.\n\nBut not responding to threats of force or military intimidation risks normalizing such aggressive behaviour and emboldening China to further destabilize international peace and stability.\n\nSuch acts of harassment and threats can happen not just on Earth but in cyberspace and outer space, all of which can have severe repercussions on civilian life and infrastructure.\n\nPattern of reckless behaviour\n\nClosely allying with Russia, and actively supplying weapons to sustain its war in Ukraine, China has not concealed its desire to reshape the world order.\n\nTaiwan is not alone suffering China's increasingly brazen naval and aerial military operations. Canadian and Australian aircraft enforcing United Nations sanctions against North Korea have also been repeatedly harassed on international waters, where states supposedly enjoy the freedom of navigation.\n\nMeanwhile, China is continuously engaged in violent border clashes with India, is challenging the sovereignty of islands that belong to Japan and militarizing islands in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.\n\nDeliberate jamming of navigation and emergency distress signals in the Asia-Pacific, which threatens the safety of international aviation, has also been attributed to China.\n\nWhy Taiwan matters\n\nTech executives around the world were recently in Taiwan to talk about the future of AI and innovative technologies. With Taiwan's prowess in computing technologies and chip production, Jensen Huang -- the Taiwanese-born NVIDIA CEO -- described his homeland as \"the unsung hero, a steadfast pillar of the world.\"\n\nBut Taiwan is also on the front lines of an increasingly aggressive and assertive China. On a daily basis, Taiwan experiences the highest rate of cyberattacks in the world originating from China, all aimed at disrupting government services and sowing social distrust.\n\nTaiwan has much to share with the world on how to enhance citizen participation in the digital age, counter foreign influence and dispel misinformation and disinformation that undermine trust in democratic institutions and processes.\n\nThe latest war games surrounding Taiwan are just another reminder of the various ways China tries to undermine liberal democracies and international peace and security. Today it may be a simulated attack. But the world must stand together and prevent it ever becoming reality.",

        "title": "Vietnam eyes greener power, seeks energy savings",
        "body": "Lights are off and air conditioning is down at the headquarters of Vietnam's state-run electricity provider EVN as the country's top power utility tries to \"lead by example\" to avoid a repeat of last year's crippling blackouts, an official tells visitors. But many businesses around Vietnam's capital Hanoi appear to be ignoring the call to conserve power, keeping decorative but otherwise purposeless neon lights on the outside of high-rise buildings on all night. The difficulties in curtailing consumption illustrate the challenges facing Vietnam a year after sudden outages caused losses of hundreds of millions of dollars to multinational manufacturers with investments in the Southeast Asian country.\n\nVietnam is pursuing a patchwork agenda of energy-saving measures, grid upgrades, regulatory reforms and a massive increase of coal power as it seeks to avert electricity shortfalls, according to government data and interviews with officials and experts. But Trinh Mai Phuong, EVN's communications director, explains during a media visit that even the biggest infrastructure upgrade underway, a new $1 billion transmission line connecting the centre of the country to the highly industrialised north that was hard hit by blackouts last year, may not be enough.\n\n\"I would not say it is a game changer,\" Phuong said of the line that could be completed as early as this month, noting\n\nit is one of many measures needed amid multiple issues to address. Power consumption for instance is expected to hit record highs in the coming weeks as the country braces for more heatwaves, he said.\n\nThe soaring power demand is making it increasingly difficult for Vietnam to meet climate change commitments while providing enough power to satisfy large investors such as Samsung Electronics, Foxconn and Canon.\n\nBroader sector-wide reforms are needed over the longer term, foreign investors and analysts said.\n\nIn the short term, Vietnam is banking mostly on coal to provide enough reliable electricity. It may be just enough - or not - but either way it may signal a blow to the country's commitments to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nCoal use rose massively in the first five months of 2024, with coal-fired power plants accounting on average for 59% of electricity output, exceeding 70% some days, according to EVN data.\n\nThat was up from nearly 45% in the same period last year and 41% in 2021, when Vietnam began drafting plans to cut coal that persuaded international donors to commit $15.5 billion to help phase out the fuel.\n\nThanks to a new coal-fired power plant that came online in 2023, coal accounted for 33% of total installed capacity last year, up from 30.8% in 2020, taking Vietnam further away from the goal of lowering that to 20% by 2030.\n\nEnergy conservation is another key pillar of the plan. EVN and its local units have encouraged energy-hungry clients, including foreign manufacturers, to save power with tailored measures, especially in peak hours.\n\nBut that risks Vietnam's reputation as a reliable place for investment and could affect future manufacturing expansion plans, according to foreign investors who declined to be named because they were not authorised to talk to media.\n\nThe matter should be addressed by solving generation and distribution issues, and not from the consumption side, two foreign investors said.\n\nVietnam's industry ministry did not reply to a request for comment. Vietnam is using only a fraction of its installed solar and onshore wind capacity due largely to administrative hurdles.\n\nIt has not approved regulations to kick-start offshore wind projects and delays dog projects to build power plants fuelled by imported liquefied natural gas, which is cleaner than coal. The four energy sources together should account for more than 40% of installed capacity by 2030, according to the government's plans, though analysts are sceptical. Hydropower is projected to fall to less than 20% of installed power generation by the end of decade from more than 30% in 2020.\n\nBut some capacity is being added in the north where needs are higher.\n\nOne of Vietnam's largest hydropower plants at Hoa Binh is adding two General Electric turbines to its existing eight, which will boost its total capacity to 2.4 gigawatts from less than 2 GW now by the second half of 2025, said Dao Trong Sang, EVN's manager of the expansion project, during a visit to the dam. The Hoa Binh plant, combined with the new transmission line that brings electricity to the north from separate plants, may add 8% capacity to the power-hungry north.\n\nThe power crisis cannot be solved without long-awaited reforms, experts say, though progress to date has been slow.\n\nIn April, the industry ministry issued an updated methodology for determining electricity prices, a step towards possibly reviving projects stuck for years because of a lack of clarity about tariffs.\n\nHowever, the methodology could force developers to shoulder excessive risk, complicating their access to finance, said a Vietnam-based official who declined to be named because they were not authorised to talk to media. A separate draft decree enabling manufacturers to buy electricity directly from producers is seen as close to approval after years of internal debate, according to several analysts. The use of direct power purchase agreements (DPPAs) could make it easier for multinational companies to avoid higher tariffs on exports and boost the use of renewables to help them meet environmental, social and governance requirements.\n\nBut the DPPA rules need to be combined with other reforms, such as clearer provisions to directly connect factories to power-generation projects, the official said.\n\nMeanwhile, Vietnamese President To Lam on Tuesday told Chinese ambassador to Hanoi Xiong Bo it was important that maritime disputes were managed well and each country's interests were respected, his office said in a statement. China is Vietnam's largest trading partner, but the two Communist-ruled neighbours have been embroiled in a years-long maritime dispute in the South China Sea. Lam said at a meeting in Hanoi that the countries needed to respect each other's legitimate interests, the statement said. The two sides need to \"actively seek satisfactory solutions in accordance with international law,\" Lam said in the meeting. On Thursday, the foreign ministry had said it was deeply concerned over the presence of a Chinese survey vessel in Vietnam's exclusive economic zone.\n\nIn Tuesday's meeting, Lam said developing friendship and cooperation with China was Vietnam's strategic choice and a priority in its foreign policies. Vietnam and China signed dozens of cooperation agreements, including on railways, during a visit to Hanoi by Chinese President Xi Jinping in December. Lam reiterated the need to boost railway connectivity between the two countries in the meeting, and asked China to further open its market for Vietnamese farm products.",

        "body": "THE Philippines must partner with like-minded states to navigate rising tensions in the disputed waters while it enhances maritime and economic security.\n\nIn a recent forum organized by international think-tank Stratbase ADR Institute in partnership with the Embassy of Australia in the Philippines, acting deputy ambassador Johanna Stratton emphasized the \"unprecedented\" maritime cooperation between Manila and Canberra, as she pointed out the need for alliances to ensure \"a stable and secure Indo-Pacific region, where our maritime and marine environments are protected.\"\n\n\"Australia is deeply concerned when countries pursue claims, or engage in activities that are inconsistent with international law; when they undertake activities that are provocative and destabilizing; when they don't respect the freedoms and rights of others; and when they advance their claims by intimidation or coercion,\" Stratton said in the hybrid event \"Forging Bonds: Exploring the Nexus Between Maritime Security and Economic Security\" in Makati City.\n\nInternational studies professor Renato de Castro, who is a trustee and program convenor of Stratbase, said China's increased incursions in the West Philippine Sea/South China Sea (WPS/SCS) should be seen not merely as a territorial dispute, but as a case of \"a maritime power bent on expansion.\"\n\nHe said the Marcos administration's \"Comprehensive Archipelagic Defense Concept (CADC),\" which is aimed at beefing up the Armed Forces of the Philippines' capabilities in countering China's maritime expansion, faces technical and financial constraints, thus the need for allies.\n\n\"The [United States] and Australia stand out as the most capable and willing security partners in assisting the Philippines in developing its capabilities to transform the CADC into a viable defense strategy,\" said De Castro, as he noted that both countries are major naval powers in the Indo-Pacific Region.\n\nTo leverage on the Philippines's treaty alliance with the US and its security partnership with Australia, the professor insisted that the country should push for the trilateral \"Australia-Philippines-United States Security Partnership\" that can advise, assist, and equip the Philippines in developing the necessary technical and material capabilities to implement its CADC.\n\nHe also urged for the enhancement of the Australia-Philippines-US trilateral military exercises that will invite Australian troops to Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement sites, and engage the two countries in security dialogues.\n\nFree Indo-Pacific\n\nSTRATBASE president Victor Andres Manhit, for his part, agreed that bolstering ties with partners like Australia is a strategic move: \"We...believe that enhanced cooperation with like-minded states is key to the Philippines achieving both maritime and economic security and ultimately, promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific. Amid geopolitical and geoeconomic challenges, such partnerships are strategically necessary to foster regional stability and prosperity.\"\n\nMeanwhile, retired rear admiral Rommel Jude Ong voiced the need to go beyond \"ceremonial patrols every three months,\" then advocated for continuous 24/7 patrols.\n\nFor Prof. Ma. Carmen Ablan-Lagman of De La Salle University, scientific collaboration can serve as a diplomatic tool to foster peaceful relations, build confidence, and promote mutual understanding even in times of conflict.\n\n\"As tensions in the [WPS/SCS] escalate, collectively addressing issues such as managing fish stocks, reducing biodiversity loss, preventing marine pollution, and extending humanitarian assistance in response to disasters without prejudice over territorial claims may be needed to build trust among agencies,\" she explained.\n\nDistrust\n\nCHINA'S increased aggression in the region has led to a staggering 91-percent distrust rating among Filipinos, based on a nationwide survey conducted by OCTA Research involving 1,200 respondents in March. Its president Ranjit Rye presented the results in the same forum.\n\nMajority, or 76 percent of Filipinos see China \"as the country posing the greatest threat to the Philippines,\" Rye added, while 61 percent support the Marcos administration's response to the dispute.\n\nNonetheless, most Filipinos seek further government action, with 73 percent preferring assertive measures such as expanded naval patrols and troop presence in the WPS/SCS over diplomacy and other peaceful methods (72 percent).\n\nMoreover, 68 percent of respondents want to strengthen the Philippine military's capability to protect the country's territories.",

        "title": "'External threats' | John Mangun",
        "body": "MANILA, Philippines -- \"The Philippines needs to prepare for 'external threats' due to heightened geopolitical tension in the Indo-Pacific, from the country's proximity to Taiwan to its dispute with China in the West Philippine Sea, President Ferdinand 'Bongbong' R. Marcos Jr. stressed\" (inquirer.net).\n\nUS President Barack Obama laid out his \"Pivot to Asia\" in 2011, as he traveled to Honolulu, Australia, and Indonesia for a series of major meetings. The message was of an integrated diplomatic, military, and economic strategy from the Indian subcontinent through Northeast Asia that would \"Profoundly shape the US-China relationship. The core message: America is going to play a leadership role in Asia for decades to come.\"\n\nHowever, Obama designed the Trans-Pacific Partnership as the key economic pillar of the Asian pivot and the TPP was dead on arrival. Was the 2012 Beijing taking control of Scarborough Shoal a response to the much heralded but underwhelming \"Pivot to Asia\"? Was \"The Pivot\" merely a sort of bribe to join TPP, which may not have been in the best interests of some regional nations including the Philippines?\n\nThe war in the Pacific was basically \"America's War in the Pacific.\" Note the approximate casualties -- killed/missing/wounded -- by nation: Australia/45,000, NZ/12,000, UK/19,000, PHL/30,000, and the US/210,000. China suffered huge military losses (7 million) as a result of the Japanese occupation from 1937.\n\nYet, in both Northeast Asia and the South China Sea, the Obama administration formally affirmed its neutrality in territorial disputes involving China. Further, until the end of the Obama presidency, it was all talk, talk, and more talk. \"Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at the ASEAN Regional Forum meeting in mid-2010 stated that the US would be willing to facilitate a collaborative process for addressing the territorial claims.\" We are still waiting.\n\n\"A few weeks earlier, President Obama left no doubt that the U.S. military and broader security focus was now shifting from Iraq and Afghanistan to Asia.\" Except then came the Arab Spring and \"We came, we saw, he died,\" Hillary Clinton joked when told of news reports of Qaddafi's death.\n\nFast-forward to 2024 and this time the US definitely means it. June 10, 2024 -- Washington Post: \"Adm. Samuel Paparo, the new head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command; The key to thwarting Xi's assumed strategy is a U.S. strategy called 'Hellscape.' The idea is that as soon as China's invasion fleet begins moving across the 100-mile waterway that separates China and Taiwan, the U.S. military would deploy thousands of unmanned submarines, unmanned surface ships and aerial drones to flood the area.\"\n\nThe fact that these \"thousands of unmanned submarines, unmanned surface ships, and aerial drones\" do not yet exist is apparently beside the point. It is the thought -- and rhetoric -- that counts.\n\nBut what if the People's Republic of China decided to blockade the main island of Taiwan, also known as Formosa? The \"Republic of China\" says that this would be an act of war against a sovereign state.\n\nThe position of the Republic of China has been that it is a de jure sovereign state. The US government recognized the government of the People's Republic of China (PRC or China) as the \"sole legal Government of China\" in 1979 and severed official diplomatic relations with the Taiwan-based Republic of China. Currently, Taiwan has 12 diplomatic allies that recognize Taiwan as the sovereign \"ROC.\"\n\n\"The Australian Government does not recognize the ROC as a sovereign state and does not regard the authorities in Taiwan as having the status of a national government.\" \"Canada has official, diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China alone.\" \"France adheres to the One China policy, where France recognized the People's Republic of China as the sole legitimate government of \"China.\"\n\nThe point is that without firing a shot, the PRC could effectively force the world to either fully accept its \"sovereignty\" over Taiwan or go to war. However, a total blockade of ships to and from Taiwan might not be necessary.\n\nGlobal Guardian, with \"expertise on security matters and duty of care requirements that come with an international corporate footprint,\" says a 'Gray Zone Embargo' is most likely at least initially where \"The PLA would conduct live fire drills more frequently, closing off Taiwan's airspace and sea lanes for longer and longer durations; and sporadically and arbitrarily start to harass Taiwan-bound merchant ships. In turn, this would create political pressure within Taiwan, spook investors, and drive risk premiums up\".\n\nNever fear though. September 20, 2023: \"Chinese blockade of Taiwan would likely fail, Pentagon official says\". Then again, September 17, 2022: \"US military intelligence says Putin unable to attain Ukraine goal\".\n\nE-mail me at mangun@gmail.com. Follow me on Twitter @mangunonmarkets.

        "body": "This handout satellite image released by Maxar Technologies on March 24, 2024 and dated March 23, 2024 shows Chinese and Philippine ships in waters where the Philippines said the China Coast Guard blocked their supply vessel and damaged it with water cannon, during a Philippine supply mission near Second Thomas Shoal in disputed waters of the South China Sea. -- Agence France-Presse\n\nMANILA, Philippines -- The country is now at the frontline against China's \"expansionist ambitions\" in the South China Sea, thanks to what experts think is due to the country's hardline and vocal stance in upholding its sovereign rights.\n\n\"We are at the frontline [against] the expansionist ambitions of China,\" Commodore Roy Vincent Trinidad, naval spokesperson for the West Philippine Sea, said in a press conference on Tuesday.\n\nTrinidad made the remark amid perceived tolerance of China when it comes to Vietnam's reclamation activities in the South China Sea.\n\nAnalysts agreed with Trinidad's observation, noting that no other South China Sea claimants experienced similar levels of Beijing's belligerence towards Manila.\n\n\"That is true,\" said geopolitical analyst Don Mclain Gill, in a message to INQUIRER.net on Tuesday, of the navy official's remarks.\n\n\"No country in the region comes close to the level of belligerence China has been demonstrating towards us in our own waters,\" Gill, a lecturer at the De La Salle University's Department of International Studies, further said.\n\nFor a military analyst and a retired Navy official, such a treatment from Beijing is due to Manila's \"vocal\" stance against their actions in the West Philippine Sea.\n\n\"China treats us differently because we are the most vocal against their actions in the South China Sea,\" said Rommel Jude Ong, a retired Philippine Navy rear admiral and a professor at the Ateneo School of Government, in a message to INQUIRER.net on Tuesday.\n\nMaking an example\n\n\"They are more belligerent because they want to make an example of us to prevent the rest of Asean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) to follow us and rise up against the Chinese Communist Party,\" Ong further said.\n\nOng then noted that other Asean states have \"more calibrated approach in dealing with China.\"\n\nApart from China and the Philippines, Asean countries such as Brunei, Malaysia, and Vietnam are also claimants of Spratly Islands inside the South China Sea.\n\nMaritime features of Spratly inside the western section of the exclusive economic zone of the Philippines -- locally known as the West Philippine Sea -- are locally known as the Kalayaan Island Group.\n\nDespite the overlapping claims, China asserts sovereignty in almost the entire South China Sea, including most of the West Philippine Sea, through its now ten-dash-line.\n\nA July 2016 arbitral award which stemmed from a case filed by Manila in 2013 already invalidated Beijing's then nine-dash-line.\n\nVietnam's reclamation\n\nHowever, China refuses to acknowledge this landmark ruling, causing tensions with claimant countries like the Philippines and Vietnam.\n\nBeijing resorted to usage of water cannons to thwart Manila's resupply mission in the BRP Sierra Madre in Ayungin (Second Thomas) Shoal to prevent the bringing of construction materials for the naval outpost.\n\nWhile China resorted to usage of water cannons against Vietnam's vessels in the past times, observers noticed that Beijing did not show the same amount of belligerence despite Hanoi's ongoing reclamation in the South China Sea features it occupies.\n\nOng then noted that Beijing's action against Hanoi is focused on its oil exploration sites.\n\nAs of November 2023, the reclamation works of Vietnam, which occupies the most number of features in South China Sea, have reached 955 hectares, according to the report of think tank Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative.\n\nPH-Vietnam have friendly relations, but...\n\nEven Manila shrugged off this development, saying it was conducted outside its exclusive economic zone.\n\n\"We do not observe any illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive actions [by Vietnam]. We have friendly relations with Vietnam,\" Trinidad said, but noting that their activities are being addressed by appropriate government agencies.\n\nBut South China Sea monitor Ray Powell noted that Vietnam's reclamation activities causes \"severe environmental impact\" and \"further militarization\" of the South China Sea.\n\n\"The Philippines should be concerned about this development, but it does not represent the clear and present danger that Beijing's extreme aggression presents,\" Powell, who heads the program of Stanford University's Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation, told INQUIRER.net in a message on Wednesday.\n\n\"Manila's muted response to Vietnam's actions have to be seen in light of this stark reality,\" he further said.\n\nOn the other hand, security expert Chester Cabalza said that Hanoi could be Manila's strategic partner against Beijing's actions in the West Philippine Sea.\n\n\"Hanoi does not bully Filipino fishers and coast guardians unlike what Beijing does to Manila,\" Cabalza, president and founder of Manila-based think tank International Development and Security Cooperation, told INQUIRER.net in a message.\n\nGill also recalled a 2019 incident in the Recto (Reed) Bank where a Filipino fishing boat sank after it was hit by a Chinese trawler. The 22 fishermen struggled to stay afloat for four hours until a Vietnamese fishing vessel rescued them.\n\n\"It was the Vietnamese who saved our Filipino fishing crew at sea when China rammed our vessel and left the crew members to die,\" Gill noted.\n\nCabalza said: \"Any disparity between Manila and Hanoi can be discussed amicably with Vietnam due to mutual trust and cooperation.\"",

        "title": "Rethinking the South China Sea in Indian Maritime Security Strategy",
        "body": "New Delhi's strategic and economic interests in the region will only grow, but there are high barriers to increasing the Indian Navy's role in the South China Sea.\n\nOn May 26, the Indian Navy (IN)'s Eastern Fleet concluded its operational deployment to the South China Sea, entailing port calls to Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Brunei. The IN's almost three-week-long presence in the contested waterways was preceded by the visit of an Indian Coast Guard ship to the South China Sea, which demonstrated shared concerns and resolve regarding regional marine pollution in addition to bolstering cooperation with the coast guards of the littoral nations. These developments have again put a spotlight on India's growing maritime engagement with Southeast Asia's coastal states - four of whom are locked in maritime disputes with China over features in the South China Sea.\n\nWhile the IN's deployment in the region is nothing new, its visits to Southeast Asian states have increased four-fold since 2013. The advancing maritime engagement between India and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) should be viewed in the context of India's commercial and strategic interests.\n\nNo less than 55 percent of India's total trade passes through the South China Sea. Meanwhile, since the early 1990s, New Delhi has been engaged in a joint hydrocarbon exploration project with Vietnam, wherein its petroleum firm, ONGC Videsh Limited, has invested about $430 million for oil drilling operations in the Phu Kanh Basin of the South China Sea. Despite China's discontent, India and Vietnam signed an agreement in 2011, which aims to develop long-term bilateral cooperation in the oil and gas industry.\n\nThe commercial stakes are likely to increase if India's strategic interests serve as any indicators. The 20th Annual ASEAN-India summit held in September 2023 was evidence of economic complementarities and India's intent to deepen commercial engagement with the region. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 12-point proposal during the summit offered tremendous opportunities for Indian businesses to further trade and commercial ties across various sectors.\n\nThe trade between the two civilizational partners is set to receive a boost with the review of the 2009 ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement. The negotiations, which are expected to conclude by 2025, would go a long way in fostering mutually beneficial diversified trade by incorporating changes in Rules of Origin and trade remedies.\n\nSimilarly, New Delhi's stakes in Southeast Asia could also be enhanced given its connectivity plans. In 2019, seizing on their mutual interest in exploring the utility of the Eastern Maritime Corridor, India and Russia signed a Memorandum of Intent on the Development of Maritime Communications between the Ports of Chennai and Vladivostok. The potential connectivity corridor would connect Chennai with Vladivostok through the South China Sea. With the route being highly cost-efficient, while also giving access to India to the mineral-rich Arctic, New Delhi remains interested in the project.\n\nBased on its commercial stakes, which are likely to increase in the future, it is clear that India has legitimate interests in ensuring the security of shipping lanes and freedom of navigation in the South China Sea.\n\nMeanwhile, India's strategic interests in the region, as exemplified by its Act East Policy (AEP) and Indo-Pacific Vision, have also nudged forward its security-oriented engagement in the region.\n\nThe AEP's objective of improved connectivity and commerce requires a South China Sea free of traditional and non-traditional security challenges. As a result, India has adopted a security-oriented approach to create an enabling environment for regional stability and prosperity.\n\nThe AEP lies at the heart of India's Indo-Pacific Vision, which recognizes ASEAN as a link, connecting the Indian Ocean to the Pacific. India's vision emphasizes the centrality and unity of ASEAN, which will remain pivotal to the former's approach for seeking peace and security in the region. With the shared objectives of ensuring peace and security and adherence to the rule of the law, a multipolar world remains in the interest of both partners.\n\nEven as India attempts to enhance its strategic profile to contribute to the equilibrium across the Indo-Pacific, the power balance is slumping in India's backyard, the Indian Ocean region (IOR). China, which has altered the status quo in the South China Sea with its predominant military presence and infrastructure in the region, has also rapidly furthered its strategic engagement with the IOR littorals.\n\nBeijing's grand Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which entails unparalleled investments and big-ticket infrastructure projects, including in the IOR, seems to have swayed some of India's neighbors. Its growing economic footprint in the region has facilitated the presence of China's People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN).\n\nSince 2010, an annual average of eight to ten vessels and submarines affiliated with the PLAN and Beijing's Ministry of Natural Resources have been known to operate in the IOR. Besides operating its civilian \"research vessels\" - which were earlier owned by the PLAN and are suspected by India to be used for improving subsurface knowledge and warfare capabilities - China's fishing vessels have been caught within India's territorial waters.\n\nBeijing's naval forays, which have fostered anxieties in Indian officials, are bound to increase in the near to mid-term to secure its ever-increasing BRI projects, cargo, and energy shipments. PLAN maneuvers in the IOR draw from China's Military Strategy (CMS) 2015, which combines the call for offshore defense with open seas protection.\n\nGoing forward, commercial, strategic, and security interests are likely to compel India to substantially increase its maritime presence in the South China Sea, or even change the region's status from a \"secondary\" area of interest to that of \"primary\" in its next version of its Maritime Security Strategy. However, that pursuit could prove to be particularly onerous.\n\nFirst, ASEAN's stance on the South China Sea dispute remains conservative. The bloc's diplomatic diffidence is attributable to intra-ASEAN divisions on the issue. China has successfully exploited the organization's internal discord and isolated Cambodia, Laos, and Brunei from other member states. This is evident by the Four Point Consensus on the South China Sea concluded in 2016, which toes Beijing's position on the dispute.\n\nIntra-ASEAN discord has partly fostered China's unabated maritime aggression, jeopardizing the maritime rights and interests of not only littoral navies but also potentially of regional stakeholders such as India. China's continued militarization of the disputed islands, and overwhelming military and paramilitary presence, wherein its coast guard can delineate exclusion zones in virtually any circumstance, could affect freedom of navigation for any foreign vessel, including those from India.\n\nSecond, in contrast to China-ASEAN economic engagement, wherein China remains an indispensable economic partner with $722 billion worth of merchandise trade, India-ASEAN trade accounts for $131 billion, a mere 18 percent of China-ASEAN trade. Beijing's investment in the region also remains incomparable. The trade levels between India and ASEAN fall far short of their potential due to a range of issues, including an absence of regional value chains, ASEAN's non-reciprocity in FTA obligations and non-tariff barriers, poor connectivity, and red tape.\n\nThese unresolved issues have adversely affected ASEAN's perception of India, creating doubts regarding the latter's political will and capacity to become a leading player in the region. Both economy and security are integral to any country's foreign policy toolkit. The limited economic exchanges serve as an impediment to a potential increase in the IN's deployment, especially given India's acutely limited trade with countries such as Cambodia, Laos, and Brunei, with each of them being highly dependent on Chinese investments. India's greater military presence in the future is likely to find acceptance or become a possibility only if New Delhi becomes a major economic partner in the region.\n\nThird, Beijing's pursuit of establishing de-facto control over the South China Sea has seen hawkish official rhetoric regarding the involvement of other stakeholders, including India. India's military engagement in the South China Sea and verbal support for the Philippines in upholding its sovereignty has been followed by an uncompromising response from Chinese officials, demanding that third parties not intervene.\n\nThe CMS adopts the same approach toward the regional security dynamics, denouncing the \"meddling\" of some external countries in the South China Sea dispute. This implicit reference seems to be pointing toward extra-territorial players with growing security cooperation such as Japan, India, and above all the United States.\n\nFurthermore, acknowledging the imperative of open seas and strategic sea lanes protection, the CMS suggests a commensurate shift in PLAN operations. By increasing the PLAN presence in the IOR, a serious concern for India, China also desires to overcome its \"Malacca dilemma.\" Since 2012, PLAN submarines, totaling three to four platforms on average have been sighted around India's Andaman Islands, leading to the latter's suspicions regarding reconnaissance and surveillance.\n\nConsequently, there remains a possibility of an enhanced PLAN presence in the Andamans and the IOR as a counter to a potential increase in IN deployments in the South China Sea.\n\nTherefore, China's military strategy and capabilities along with India's weak economic footprint in the region serve as limitations for the IN making the South China Sea into a primary interest area in the coming decades.\n\nNonetheless, the IN should continue to maintain across-the-spectrum operational engagements with its counterparts in the South China Sea. India needs to step up its strategic role, explore convergences in capacity-building sectors such as digital innovation, and leverage complementarities in trade with the ASEAN.\n\nIn the near term, besides broad-based cooperation on maritime domain awareness, New Delhi would do well to probe trilateral exercises with littoral navies and conclude long overdue logistic pacts with Indonesia and Malaysia. The considerations of India's commercial interests and balance of power necessitate New Delhi's constant focus on its maritime diplomacy to ensure secure seas and adherence to the rule of law.",

He emphasized that apathy and societal issues hinder national progress and urged his constituents to emulate the resilience and determination of the country's forefathers.\n\nGarcia highlighted the power of the people to shape the city's and nation's identity.\n\n\"May we then continue to do our part and fight our own battles to help build a stronger and resilient Cebu City and Philippines,\" he said.\n\n\"May we all rekindle within ourselves the same burning fire for patriotism and love of the country of our heroes,\" he added.\n\nFor his part, Lapu-Lapu City Mayor Junard \"Ahong\" Chan said Independence Day symbolizes the nation's triumph, urging citizens to prioritize love for the country and strive for a more prosperous Philippines.\n\nHe highlighted the nation's journey from war to freedom, acknowledging heroes like Lapulapu, Jose Rizal and Andres Bonifacio.\n\nHis wife, Lapu-Lapu Lone District Rep. Ma. Cynthia \"Cindi\" Chan also recognized the sacrifices of ancestors.\n\nIn Mandaue City, Mayor Jonas Cortes urged his fellow citizens to value the efforts of Filipino forefathers who fought for freedom.\n\nCortes said nation-building starts with the people being responsible citizens.\n\n\"The future lets us move forward filled with hope and promise each step we take no matter how small brings us closer to Mandaue that is vibrant, inclusive and resilience,\" he said.\n\nCelebrities Barbie Forteza and David Licauco joined Mandaue's Independence Day celebration.\n\nPhilippine Independence Day is a national holiday observed every year on June 12. It commemorates the declaration of independence from Spanish colonial rule on this day in 1898. / CDF, JPS, CAV, DPC",

        "title": "A step towards peace in Ukraine",
        "body": "The Summit on Peace organised by Switzerland will bring together almost 100 nations from all parts of the globe to discuss how to initiate a process to end the war against Ukraine. The EU fully supports these efforts. No one desires peace more than the Ukrainian people, but lasting peace can only be achieved if it is grounded in the core principles of the UN Charter.\n\nThis weekend, I will attend the Summit on Peace in Ukraine in Switzerland. It is not a platform for direct negotiations between Ukraine and Russia. This Summit rather aims to develop among the participating countries common parameters for peace, grounded in international law and the UN Charter.\n\nThe Summit will also focus on selected practical issues on which to engage Russia: how to enhance nuclear security, facilitate the exchange of captives and ensure the return of the many thousands of Ukrainian children abducted to Russia, a practice that harks back to darker periods of European history. It will also focus on ensuring free navigation and protecting Black Sea port infrastructure. The impact of the war of aggression against Ukraine extends far beyond its borders. A protracted or frozen conflict would perpetuate instability and threaten global food security and economic stability. Progress in these areas could open avenues for engagement with Russia in other areas over time.\n\nThis war and its outcome are existential for Ukraine, but also for European security. Any ceasefire that would allow Russia to keep its repressive regime in occupied territories would reward this aggression, undermine international law and encourage further territorial expansion by Russia. Every UN report since 2022 provides ample evidence of the brutal repression of Ukrainians and the systematic human rights violations in occupied Ukraine.\n\nRussia is fighting an unprovoked war of choice, driven by imperial ambition, while Ukraine is fighting a war of necessity, defending its very right to exist.\n\nNo one desires peace more than the Ukrainians. However, the right conditions for peace matter for Ukraine and for the world. Russia is fighting an unprovoked war of choice, driven by imperial ambition, while Ukraine is fighting a war of necessity, defending its very right to exist. As Vladimir Putin said again in Saint Petersburg a few days ago, he pursues full victory on the battlefield and sees no urgency to end the war. Only a few weeks ago, he launched a new offensive against Kharkiv. His missiles have largely destroyed Ukraine's energy infrastructure and continue to kill Ukrainian civilians every day.\n\nMeanwhile, his envoys tour the world to discourage countries from engaging in the Summit for Peace. Russia is obviously not ready to engage in good faith negotiations and would use any ceasefire to rearm and attack again. Russia's narratives around peace are merely disguised attempts to legitimise its war of territorial conquest.\n\nConsequently, Russia's declaration that it would not attend the Swiss summit, even if invited, did not come as a surprise. However, the participation of close to 100 countries and organizations, from Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America, indicates robust international support to end the war on the basis of the UN Charter. This is crucial to reassure Ukraine, the victim of Russia's war of aggression, ahead of any possible engagement with Russia.\n\nThe participation of close to 100 countries and organizations, from Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America, indicates robust international support to end the war on the basis of the UN Charter.\n\nOther proposals will also be discussed at the Summit, but we believe that Ukraine's 10-point peace formula remains the most credible basis for future peace negotiations. Proposals that do not reference the UN Charter and ignore Ukraine's political sovereignty, territorial integrity and right to self-defence would amount to rewarding the aggressor and legitimising Russia's attempts to redraw borders by force. Such proposals cannot bring lasting peace. In this regard, the absence of China in Switzerland and its outreach to discourage participation do not strengthen China's claims of neutrality.\n\nThe EU wants peace in Ukraine. A diplomatic solution that respects international norms would have the backing of all EU Member States. At the same time, we must continue to match our diplomatic efforts with military support, in line with Ukraine's inherent right to self-defence as per article 51 of the UN Charter. Given that Putin shows no intention to negotiate in good faith, Europe's continued military support to Ukraine remains just as crucial to peace in Ukraine as our support for a diplomatic track.\n\nYes, wars generally tend to end with a peace agreement, but the content of this peace agreement is crucial to European and global security, and the international rules-based order. Let's make the Summit on Peace in Switzerland a first step to a fair, UN Charter-based peace in Ukraine.",

        "body": "Vietnam's new President To Lam has asked that Beijing respect Hanoi's rights and interests in disputed waters, days after Vietnamese officials protested against what they called \"China's illegal activities\" in the Gulf of Tonkin.\n\nLast Thursday, a Vietnamese foreign ministry spokesperson denounced the operation of the Chinese navy survey vessel Hai Yang 26 in Vietnam's exclusive economic zone and continental shelf and said that Vietnam \"has engaged in multiple diplomatic exchanges\" with China to demand the ending of such operations.\n\nTo Lam, while not mentioning the Hai Yang 26, told Chinese ambassador to Vietnam Xiong Bo that the two neighbors should strictly implement bilateral agreements, better control and resolve disagreements at sea, as well as respect each other's legitimate rights and interests, his office said in a statement .\n\nThe two countries should also actively seek appropriate ways to settle maritime disputes in accordance with international law, especially the U.N. Convention on the law of the sea (UNCLOS), he said.\n\nThe new president stressed that Vietnam saw its relationship with China as a \"strategic choice and top priority\" of its foreign policy.\n\nLam was sworn in as Vietnam's state president on May 22 amid an unprecedented reshuffle of the communist party's leadership following the \"burning furnace\" anti-graft campaign initiated by party chief Nguyen Phu Trong.\n\nXiong Bo became the first foreign ambassador to pay Lam a courtesy call to congratulate him on his new post.\n\nHai Yang 26\n\nIn last week's unusually strong rebuke, foreign ministry spokeswoman Pham Thu Hang said that Vietnam was \"deeply concerned,\" resolutely opposed, and demanded that China immediately stop the \"illegal survey activities\" of the Hai Yang 26 in Vietnam's waters and not repeat them.\n\nHang told reporters in Hanoi that the Vietnamese government \"has engaged in multiple diplomatic exchanges\" with the Chinese side over the case.\n\nChinese survey vessels have frequently operated in Vietnam's exclusive economic zone but it has seldom publicly protested, giving preference to quieter bilateral channels.\n\nA Vietnamese analyst, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue, said that the new leader - who was seen as a hard-liner because of his public security background -- may want to show that he is not pro-China, as some critics say.\n\nAnother analyst, Hoang Viet, told RFA that the foreign ministry's reaction was due to the severity of the event, as well as to partially direct attention to Vietnam amid increased tensions between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea.\n\nHai Yang 26 is one of nine Type 636A hydrographic survey vessels in service with the Chinese People's Liberation Army navy.\n\nThis kind of survey ship is thought to be utilized by the navy for mapping the underwater topography map in areas where submarines operate, as well as to conduct marine surveys, such as the study of ocean acoustics.\n\nThe fact that Vietnam had \"multiple diplomatic exchanges\" with China over the vessel suggested it had been operating in Vietnam's waters for a prolonged period.\n\nChina has yet to respond to Vietnam's protest but a Chinese think tank, the South China Sea Probing Initiative, wrote on the social media platform X that the Hai Yang 26 only conducted a freedom of navigation operation, a type of patrol that China itself has deemed provocative on numerous occasions when conducted by other navies.",

        "body": "Polish climber Marcin Banot was arrested as he tried to scale a 30-storey building in Buenos Aires without harness, wearing the iconic number 10 Argentina football jersey.\n\nThe 36-year-old daredevil managed to scale 25 floors of the 410ft Globant building as surprised onlookers gathered to watch him perform the live stunt.\n\nMore than 30 firefighters, ambulances, and rescuers were deployed under the building after someone inside called the police.\n\nHe wore the Argentinian football team's number 10 jersey - a number considered iconic due to its association with soccer legends such as Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi.\n\nVideo footage zoomed in to show him trying to climb up as firefighters rushed to rescue him and onlookers watched in anticipation.\n\nKnown by his nickname \"BNT\" on social media, the urban climber has pulled similar stunts in other countries as well and has 2.7 million followers on YouTube.\n\nHowever, his ambition was cut short after he was plucked from the building in a safety harness by firefighters and brought back to the ground.\n\nMr Banot did not resist arrest as he was taken into custody. He could be ordered to pay the cost of rescue operations, officials said.\n\nIt was his second attempt to climb the same building after he was taken down during his first attempt earlier.\n\nArrests and legal troubles are not new for rooftoppers. It is not known if he was scaling for a cause or a campaign as usually the urban climbers do.\n\nEarlier this year, a free climber known as the \"French Spiderman\" scaled a skyscraper in Manila to bring attention to the South China Sea dispute amid incidents of standoffs between the Philippines and China.\n\nAlain Robert, 61, briefly brought traffic to a standstill and drew a crowd of shocked onlookers in the Philippine capital's financial district as he scaled a 47-storey building without a harness. He was swiftly arrested by the police as they waited for him to climb down.\n\nLast year, a British man was taken into custody after he attempted to scale the world's fifth tallest building without a harness. The man, identified by the Chosun Ilbo newspaper as George King-Thompson, managed to climb half-way up the building to the 73rd floor before South Korean authorities forced him to abandon his attempt to reach the top of 123-storey Lotte World Tower in Seoul.",

        "body": "Taking a strong stance soon after assuming office for a third consecutive term, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made a comprehensive plan to school China over the issue of territorial integrity. As per a report in the Diplomat, India is mulling renaming of over two dozen places in Tibet, in a tit-for-tat move. The list of the places has been prepared by the Army's Information Warfare Division and is expected to be released soon.\n\nThe new names of the places are based on historical research and the opinions of the local residents. Notably, China recently renamed some areas of Arunachal Pradesh unilaterally, claiming that the territory belongs to them. India's move is seen as a retaliation to this move by the dragon. China refers to Arunachal Pradesh as 'Zangnan'. However, India has consistently rejected all of China's claims.\n\nALSO READ: Chandrababu Naidu Takes Oath As Andhra Pradesh CM; Pawan Kalyan, Nara Lokesh Sworn In As Ministers\n\nRecently, top officials of the Indian Army visited the disputed border areas.\n\nIn March, China renamed 30 places along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Arunachal, including 11 residential areas, 12 mountains, four rivers, one lake, one mountain pass, and a piece of land. It was the fourth instance when China renamed places which belonged to India. The first list of six such places was released by them in 2017, the second of 15 places in 2021, and a third list with names for 11 places in 2023.\n\nChina and India have been at loggerheads over a plethora of issues, including territorial claims, for the last few decades. The most aggressive face-off between the Indian Army and the PLA was witnessed in Ladakh in 2020.\n\nALSO READ: EBC Inclusion, Focus On Caste Equation: How Modi Cabinet 3.0 Set The Scene For 2025 Bihar Assembly Election\n\nBoth Armies were involved in skirmishes at locations along the Sino-Indian border, including near the disputed Pangong Lake in Ladakh and the Tibet Autonomous Region, and near the border between Sikkim and the Tibet Autonomous Region. Several causalities also took place during the clashes.",

        "body": "{{ #verifyErrors }}{{ message }}{{ /verifyErrors }}{{ ^verifyErrors }}Something went wrong. Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nPolish climber Marcin Banot was arrested as he tried to scale a 30-storey building in Buenos Aires without harness, wearing the iconic number 10 Argentina football jersey.\n\nThe 36-year-old daredevil managed to scale 25 floors of the 410ft Globant building as surprised onlookers gathered to watch him perform the live stunt.\n\nMore than 30 firefighters, ambulances, and rescuers were deployed under the building after someone inside called the police.\n\nHe wore the Argentinian football team's number 10 jersey - a number considered iconic due to its association with soccer legends such as Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi.\n\nVideo footage zoomed in to show him trying to climb up as firefighters rushed to rescue him and onlookers watched in anticipation.\n\nKnown by his nickname \"BNT\" on social media, the urban climber has pulled similar stunts in other countries as well and has 2.7 million followers on YouTube.\n\nHowever, his ambition was cut short after he was plucked from the building in a safety harness by firefighters and brought back to the ground.\n\nMr Banot did not resist arrest as he was taken into custody. He could be ordered to pay the cost of rescue operations, officials said.\n\nIt was his second attempt to climb the same building after he was taken down during his first attempt earlier.\n\nArrests and legal troubles are not new for rooftoppers. It is not known if he was scaling for a cause or a campaign as usually the urban climbers do.\n\nEarlier this year, a free climber known as the \"French Spiderman\" scaled a skyscraper in Manila to bring attention to the South China Sea dispute amid incidents of standoffs between the Philippines and China.\n\nAlain Robert, 61, briefly brought traffic to a standstill and drew a crowd of shocked onlookers in the Philippine capital's financial district as he scaled a 47-storey building without a harness. He was swiftly arrested by the police as they waited for him to climb down.\n\nLast year, a British man was taken into custody after he attempted to scale the world's fifth tallest building without a harness. The man, identified by the Chosun Ilbo newspaper as George King-Thompson, managed to climb half-way up the building to the 73rd floor before South Korean authorities forced him to abandon his attempt to reach the top of 123-storey Lotte World Tower in Seoul.",

        "title": "Vietnam on Record Pace for Spratly Island Construction in 2024, Report Says",
        "body": "Over the past six months, the country has reclaimed almost as much new land as it did in the previous two years combined, closing the gap with China's \"island fortresses.\"\n\nVietnam has \"significantly accelerated\" the expansion of its outposts in the Spratly Islands over the last six months, a U.S. think tank said last week, putting Hanoi on pace for a \"record year of island building\" in 2024.\n\nIn a briefing published on June 7, the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative (AMTI) stated that the country had created \"almost as much new land as it had in the previous two years combined.\"\n\nAMTI, run by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., said that since November 2023, Vietnam had created 692 new acres (280 hectares) of land across 10 features in the Spratly Islands. In comparison, it made 404 acres (163.5 hectares) of land in the first 11 months of 2023 and 342 acres (138.4 hectares) in all of 2022.\n\nBarque Canada Reef remains Vietnam's largest outpost in the Spratlys, the report said, nearly doubling over the last six months from 238 to 412 acres (96 to 167 hectares).\n\nAccording to AMTI, Vietnam has considerably closed the gap with China in terms of the amount of space that it has created in the Spratly Islands. The country now boasts five of the 10 largest features in the Spratly Islands, which are occupied (and disputed) by China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Brunei. While the three largest Chinese-occupied features - Mischief Reef, Subi Reef, and Fiery Cross Reef - remain the largest by a considerable way, the next four largest outposts are all newly expanded Vietnamese features: Barque Canada Reef, Namyit Island, Pearson Reef, and Discovery Great Reef. The remaining positions in the top ten are taken up by Itu Aba (occupied by Taiwan), Thitu Island (the Philippines), and Sand Cay (Vietnam).\n\nVietnam's total dredging and landfill in disputed areas of the South China Sea amounts to approximately 2,360 acres (955 hectares), around half of China's 4,650 acres (1,882 hectares), up from just 329 acres (133 hectares) three years ago.\n\nHowever, while Vietnam's expanding acreage in the Spratly Islands is now comparable to the real estate that China has reclaimed over the past decade, it still faces a large gap in terms of facilities. Subi, Mischief, and Fiery Cross reefs now each boast multi-story administrative buildings, advanced radar arrays, jet hangars, and 3,000-meter runways capable of handling the largest Chinese bombers. The other four reclaimed Chinese features in the Spratly Archipelago include similarly advanced facilities on a smaller scale.\n\nVietnam boasts a single 1,300-meter runway on Spratly Island, though AMTI noted that Barque Canada Reef now measures 4,318 meters in length, giving it \"the potential to host a 3,000-meter runway like those that China has at Fiery Cross, Mischief, and Subi Reefs.\"\n\nAMTI notes that Vietnam has also begun \"preliminary construction\" of new facilities on its 10 features. \"Notable developments include the completion of a boat ramp on Namyit Island and the construction of a new harbor at Central Reef,\" the briefing stated. It stated that temporary helipads could be seen at a number of the artificial islands, while \"trenches and coastal defense emplacements typical of Vietnam's Spratly outposts can be seen underway at several features.\"\n\nThe rash of reclamation and dredging activity indicates Vietnam's desire to close the gap with China in the disputed waterway and create its own \"facts on the ground\" at a time of growing tensions in disputed waters, particularly between China and the Philippines.\n\nIt is unlikely that Vietnam will ever eclipse China's \"island fortresses,\" either in qualitative or quantitative terms, but its efforts indicate a desire to hold the line against Chinese incursions, defend its sovereign claims in the Spratly Islands, and help preserve the tense status quo in contested waters.",

        "title": "Chinese in Malaysia: Proud of China's Rise, Yet Fiercely Malaysian | FULCRUM",
        "body": "Chinese Malaysians are proud of China's rise as a great power. But they have also forged a separate cultural identity quite apart from China's efforts.\n\nChina's rise has rekindled civilizational pride among some overseas Chinese communities, including those in Malaysia. However, Malaysian Chinese have also forged a distinctive localised cultural identity, intertwined with an unmistakable sense of national belonging as Malaysians.\n\nBeijing has long recognised overseas Chinese as an essential bridge linking China to the outside world. In recent years, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the State Council has intensified its efforts to strengthen ties with the Chinese diaspora. Some within the Southeast Asian Chinese community have emerged as intermediaries facilitating connections between China and the international community, especially in trade and commerce. More broadly, Beijing's outreach efforts, like the recently launched Global Civilization Initiative, have sparked a resurgence of cultural connections. Platforms such as CCTV, WeChat, and TikTok serve as channels through which overseas Chinese are rekindling their fascination with China's history and traditions.\n\nIn Malaysia, the Chinese community, especially among the English-educated, is undergoing a phenomenon some refer to as re-Sinicisation. This is broadly defined as a renewed interest and enthusiasm for embracing their Chinese cultural roots. Mandarin, for example, is gradually replacing English as the predominant working language within the Malaysian Chinese community, alongside Malay, the national language. The re-Sinicisation process has emerged as a contentious issue, particularly concerning the cultural identity of the Malaysian Chinese. Recently, former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad reignited the discourse by questioning the loyalty of the Chinese community, citing perceived hesitance on their part in fully embracing other cultures. The increasing influence of China adds another layer of complexity to this issue.\n\nNonetheless, the crisis of Chinese cultural identity in Malaysia is intricately linked to the nation's complicated experiment with multiculturalism. Unlike countries like Indonesia, Malaysia chose accommodation over assimilation in dealing with its minority population. Chinese in Malaysia, for instance, are allowed to retain their Chinese names, whereas in Indonesia, they are required to adopt Indonesian names. This policy has proven to be a double-edged sword. The celebration of diversity is done at the expense of the country's aspiration for unity. This has led to a lack of a unified Malaysian cultural identity.\n\nThe rise of China has sparked a resurgence of civilisational pride among Chinese communities in Malaysia. Nevertheless, Malaysian Chinese have forged a distinct localized cultural identity, enriched with unique Malaysian characteristics.\n\nThe Malaysian education system encapsulates this challenge. In addition to national schools, Malaysia offers minorities the option to attend vernacular schools. However, the perceived shortcomings of the public school system have led most Chinese families to opt for vernacular schools. This has resulted in segregation, undermining efforts to cultivate a shared national identity. The government's efforts to foster a common identity are perceived by minorities as attempts to erode the country's diversity. Thus, Sinicisation is foremost driven by this struggle to safeguard what Malaysian Chinese believe are their constitutional rights.\n\nTo be sure, the Malaysian Chinese community is a culturally diverse group, encompassing Malay-speaking Peranakans, as well as those educated in English and Chinese. While there is a collective effort to preserve the country's pluralism, it is noteworthy that the Chinese-educated segment takes a leading role in advocating for it, thereby elevating the profile of the Mandarin language. Nevertheless, the Malaysian Chinese community remains richly diverse, with Peranakans and the English-educated maintaining their multicultural, multilingual way-of-life.\n\nThe culturally diverse Malaysian Chinese also exhibit distinct differences from their counterparts on the mainland. One contributing factor is that the Malaysian Chinese community was spared the Cultural Revolution. Unlike their mainland counterparts, they have preserved many traditional norms, particularly those related to religious beliefs. Furthermore, interaction with the Malay and Indian community has enriched Malaysian Chinese culture, infusing it with unique Malaysian characteristics. Peranakan cuisine exemplifies how Malay and Indian-style cooking have embellished the Malaysian Chinese culinary tradition. This cultural synergy extends across various domains, including linguistic fusion, architecture designs, fashion, and musical expression. While Malaysian Chinese acknowledge their ancestral ties to China, their cultural identity has primarily been shaped by domestic influences. This has resulted in the development of traits that are distinctly Malaysian, setting them apart from their fellow Chinese on the mainland.\n\nUndoubtedly, citizenship stands as the defining factor that differentiates Malaysian Chinese from their counterparts in China. In 1955, Premier Zhou Enlai encouraged overseas Chinese to embrace local citizenship and integrate into the societies they found themselves in. However, some have raised concerns that China's present leadership is blurring this distinction, with stronger appeals by Beijing to Chinese overseas to support China.\n\nThe overseas Chinese narrative is but one among numerous migration stories, including those of the Irish and Indian diaspora. Nonetheless, a distinguishing aspect for the Chinese is the geopolitical rivalry between their ancestral homeland, China, and the US. Consequently, some overseas Chinese find themselves caught in the crosshairs of this great power competition.\n\nThe Malaysian government has consistently maintained a neutral stance in the ensuing Sino-US rivalry. However, the Malaysian Chinese media frequently adopts a discernible pro-China perspective in this ongoing geopolitical contestation. That said, Malaysian Chinese support for China is not unconditional. When issues arise that directly impact Malaysia's sovereignty, such as the territorial disputes in the South China Sea, Malaysian Chinese media have taken a clear and unequivocal nationalistic stance in support of Malaysia.\n\nThe rise of China has sparked a resurgence of civilisational pride among Chinese communities in Malaysia. Nevertheless, Malaysian Chinese have forged a distinct localised cultural identity, enriched with unique Malaysian characteristics. While they acknowledge and celebrate China's reemergence, they maintain a deep-rooted sense of belonging to Malaysia. Indeed, their Malaysian nationality is the primary foundation of Malaysian Chinese self-identity.",

The end of history did not arrive in the 1990s. History has continued,\" he added.\n\nREAD: Filipinos will never bow to oppression, says Marcos on Independence Day\n\nWhile Brown did not specify which situation he was referring to, the Philippines has been at the forefront against China's maritime expansion in the West Philippine Sea.\n\n\"Patient, serious dialogue, together with a respect for international law and a respect for legitimate diversity. Engaging with others, and particularly those with whom we profoundly disagree, is the surest way of avoiding the catastrophe of escalation,\" Brown said.\n\nTensions between Beijing and Manila have escalated since Marcos assumed the presidency and reasserted the Philippines' claim over the disputed waters.",

        "body": "China increased its forces in the West Philippine Sea (WPS), deploying 146 vessels between June 4 to 10, the Philippine Navy said on Wednesday.\n\nIn an updated list, the Philippine Navy said they have observed more ships from China in various locations across the disputed international waters this past week.\n\nNavy WPS Commodore Roy Vincent Trinidad earlier reported 125 Chinese vessels, which they monitored from May 28 to June 3. This marked a slight increase from the previous week's count of 122.\n\nThe updated list includes 16 vessels from China Coast Guard (CCGVs), 22 from the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), and 108 ships from the China Maritime Militia (CMMVs).\n\nThe breakdown of the vessels across various strategic locations in the WPS is as follows:\n\nThe Philippine Navy continues to monitor and report on these incursions. The surge in Chinese vessels highlights the increasing tension and the complexities of maritime security in the WPS.\n\nThe presence of Chinese ships in these disputed waters has been a point of contention between China and the Philippines, with Manila asserting its sovereignty in its 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zone and Beijing relentless in its expansionist agenda.",

Most of them could not help but make a reference on the rising tensions in the West Philippine Sea (WPS).\n\nEscudero: Unity and progress\n\nSenate President Francis Escudero took to social media to greet Filipinos on this holiday with a message of hope and unity. Reflecting on this year's theme, \"Freedom. The Future. History,\" Escudero emphasized the importance of remembering the sacrifices of the nation's heroes.\n\n\"The freedom we enjoy today is the result of their courage,\" he noted. The seasoned politician out of Sorsogon urged Filipinos to carry the spirit of freedom in their hearts as a guide for progress and transformation. \"Long live the Philippines! Long live the Filipino people!\"\n\nEstrada: Defending sovereignty\n\nSenate President Pro Tempore Jinggoy Estrada highlighted the collective efforts needed to safeguard the nation's sovereignty. While Estrada did not go into specifics, his remarks alluded to the Philippines' ongoing territorial disputes with China in the WPS or South China Sea.\n\nIn his message delivered in Tagalog, Estrada stressed that the true spirt of freedom is best expressed in our readiness to fight for our sovereignty whenever it is challenged.\n\n\"The compassion we have for each other is our strongest weapon against foreign forces, who want to change our territory and weaken our sovereignty,\" Estrada said.\n\nVillanueva: Resisting aggression\n\nSenator Joel Villanueva echoed the sentiments of vigilance and resilience. He called on Filipinos to stand firm in defense of their freedom, just as their forefathers did, amid ongoing Chinese aggression in the WPS.\n\nVillanueva praised the unity of Filipinos despite these challenges, saying, \"Our love for our country is very much alive.\" He also emphasized the broader struggle for freedom from joblessness, hunger, poverty, and loss of hope.\n\nHontiveros: Protect national interests\n\nSenate Deputy Minority Leader Risa Hontiveros made an impassioned plea for Filipinos to unite and rise up to protect our national interests, noting that \"our freedom is being tested,\" considering the relentless expansionist claims of China in the WPS.\n\n\"China continues to encroach in the West Philippine Sea. Their harassment of our fishermen, Coast Guard and Navy has been persistent. They (Filipinos) are risking their lives and safety every time they sail, when they are supposed to cruise peacefully in our waters,\" Hontiveros stated in Tagalog.\n\nShe encouraged the public to keep fighting for our territorial rights and resist any attempt of stealing natural resources from areas within our exclusive economic zone. Hontiveros also reiterated that Philippine Offshore Gaming Operations (POGO) remains a threat to national security.\n\n\"POGOs should be banned in the Philippines. Let us keep fighting those forces that want to hinder our progress. No one is going to stand up for these issues but us Filipinos,\" Hontiveros said. She also hoped for many Filipinos to be freed not only from invaders, but poverty as well.\n\nRevilla: Honoring History\n\nSenator Ramon Revilla, Jr. underscored the importance of remembering the nation's historical struggles. The actor-politician led wreath-laying and flag-raising ceremonies at the Dambana ni Emilio Aguinaldo in Kawit, Cavite, where he also delivered his Independence Day remarks.\n\nRevilla highlighted the significance of celebrating the holiday in Kawit, where Aguinaldo proclaimed independence from Spanish rule in 1898. A native of Cavite, the senator reminded Filipinos of the ongoing pursuit to protect and uphold the nation's sovereignty.",

        "body": "At a time when the Indo-Pacific region is facing increasing contestations over territorial boundaries and piracy, India's Chief Hydrographer Vice Admiral LS Pathania on Tuesday emphasised the need to increase investment in infrastructure such as satellites, remote sensing platforms, and data centres for better geospatial awareness.\n\nSpeaking at the 14th edition of the Indo-Pacific Geo Intelligence Forum, Vice Admiral LS Pathania said, \"Geospatial technology is a cornerstone for enhancing security and stability for the Indo-Pacific region, which faces significant challenges, territorial disputes, piracy, illegal fishing, and environmental degradation.\"\n\nEmerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning hold great promise for geospatial applications, he said at the event.\n\n\"Geospatial intelligence revolutionises our understanding of sea and land. High resolution satellite imagery, accurate positioning systems, advanced depth imaging equipment sophisticated data and analysis tools allow us to produce detail maps, nautical charts, monitor coastal changes, predict sea level fluctuations with unprecedented accuracy,\" Chief Hydrographer stated.\n\nAccording to him, geospatial technologies, which provide a common platform for collaboration enabling countries to share data and build trust, are facing some challenges, including those related to information sharing, technological capacity, and infrastructure.\n\nHe advocated that establishing protocols and frameworks for data sharing, developing capability, and promoting partnerships between government agencies and the private sector is crucial to developing expertise in the domain. As a Hydrographer, Vice Admiral Pathania stated that he has witnessed first-hand the transformative potential of geospatial technology in enhancing maritime safety and security.\n\nThe other key speaker at the two-day Forum, Lt. Gen Rakesh Kapoor, Deputy Chief of the Army Staff (Information Systems and Coordination), said the Indo-Pacific is the region of hope since it is an economic powerhouse and nearly half of the world's population resides here.\n\n\"Over 35% of global cybercrimes occur within the confines of Indo-pacific geography. Human trafficking, illegal fishing, drugs, and piracy are all on the rise in this region, leading to loss of livelihoods,\" Lt Gen Kapoor stated to outline the trends in the region.\n\nThe next important global trend is the dwindling authority of the international institutions, Kapoor pointed out.\n\nThe two-day event will throw light on the combined power of geospatial intelligence, space-based assets, and cutting-edge innovation to tackle emerging threats in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on June 12, 2024",

        "title": "Analysts see rising war threat in China's new South China Sea policies",
        "body": "Military experts are warning of an increased risk of war with China following recent announcements by Beijing providing for more aggressive enforcement of its claims to disputed regions of the South China Sea.\n\nLate last month, China announced its coast guard will be empowered to investigate and detain for up to 60 days \"foreigners who endanger China's national security and interests\" in the disputed waters. The policy will take effect on June 15.\n\nAnd on June 8, it announced it would permit the Philippines to deliver supplies and evacuate personnel from an outpost on the disputed Second Thomas Shoal, which has been determined by an international tribunal to lie within Philippine waters, only if it first notifies Beijing.\n\nThe Philippine National Security Council replied that the country will continue to maintain and supply its outposts in the South China Sea without seeking permission from any other country.\n\nIn a formal statement under the council's letterhead, national security adviser Eduardo Ano dismissed the suggestion as\"absurd, ridiculous and unacceptable.\"\n\nAccording to a June 10 report in the South China Morning Post, a survey released by independent polling agency OCTA Research showed that 73% of Filipinos support further military action to safeguard the Philippines' territorial rights, including expanded naval patrols and the dispatch of additional troops.\n\nPhilippine media believe the new procedures will empower the Chinese coast guard to \"arbitrarily\" arrest Filipinos in their own waters. China's claims to almost the entire sea reach into the internationally recognized economic zones of several Southeast Asian countries.\n\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. called the new rules \"totally unacceptable\" and said he will take all necessary measures to \"protect citizens\" and continue to\"defend the country's territory.\"\n\nIn his keynote speech at the Shangri-La Security Dialogue in Singapore on May 31, the president pointed out that if a Filipino was killed in a South China Sea conflict with China, it would\"almost certainly\" cross a red line and come \"very close\" to what the Philippines defines as an act of war.\n\nJohn C. Aquilino, former head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, testified before the U.S. Congress last month that Manila could invoke the 1951 U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty in such a case.\n\nBob Savic, head of international trade at the Global Policy Institute in London, said last week that this could bring the United States and China into a direct conflict.\n\n\"The trigger for the First World War occurred on June 28, 1914, with the assassination of Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand in a country in Southeast Europe. This time, the trigger could be the death of a Filipino sailor in the tropical waters of Southeast Asia,\" he wrote in an article published in the Asia Times.\n\nHe believes if Manila is forced to request U.S. assistance under the Mutual Defense Treaty, it is conceivable that China Coast Guard ships would quickly confront U.S. warships maintaining freedom of navigation in the region. \\\"The U.S. and China must ensure they don't sleepwalk into a repeat of the 1914 tragedy in the second half of June 2024 or, indeed, at any point in the future,\" Savic wrote.\n\n'It might trigger escalation'\n\nAndrea Chloe Wong, a nonresident research fellow at the Institute for Indo-Pacific Affairs, told VOA at a June 6 seminar hosted by the National Bureau of Asian Research that if the Mutual Defense Treaty is invoked, \"it might trigger escalation or conflict between the Philippines and China.\"\n\nThe safety of Filipino personnel has become the focus of recent rounds of South China Sea disputes. On June 7, the Philippines accused a Chinese coast guard ship of ramming a Philippine ship, deterring the evacuation of a sick soldier from a grounded warship which serves as a Philippine military outpost on the Second Thomas Shoal.\n\nRomeo Brawner, chief of staff of the armed forces of the Philippines, told reporters June 4 that Chinese coast guard officers had seized some food that a plane dropped for Philippine naval personnel aboard the aging warship. He also released video of the incident, AP reported.\n\nDespite the rising tension, Oriana Skylar Mastro, a Center Fellow at Stanford University's Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, told VOA that the possibility of World War III breaking out in the South China Sea is not high.\n\nShe believes that China will not choose to fight a war in the South China Sea at this time because they know they would lose.\n\n\"They can't project power across those kinds of distances yet. When I talk to the PLA [People's Liberation Army, China's principal military force], they say the only reason they haven't declared internal waters in the Spratly [chain] is because there's no way they can enforce that.\"\n\nUS promises assets, say reports\n\nThe United States Coast Guard has promised to send assets to the South China Sea to help Manila uphold sovereign rights in its exclusive economic zone, ABS-CBN News said Tuesday, citing the Philippine Coast Guard.\n\nIn a statement, the Philippine Coast Guard said the U.S. Coast Guard will deploy its North Pacific Coast Guard following a proposal by Philippine Admiral Ronnie Gil Gavan. Gavan called for a \"greater deployment\" in the high seas \"to address the forthcoming threat\" posed by China's threat to arrest foreigners inside what it claims as its maritime boundaries.\n\nIn a research report released last month by the National Bureau of Asian Research, Michael Shoebridge of the Strategic Analysis Australia pointed out that collective action by the Philippines and its allies could effectively reduce risks in the South China Sea.\n\n\"The risk of such collective action escalating into conflict is real. However, it could be mitigated by the militaries clearly acting within international law and coordinating a united political response to demonstrate and communicate this,\" he wrote. \"That would counter Chinese efforts\"to intimidate others and cast such lawful action as aggression.\"\n\nShoebridge, who also attended the National Bureau of Asian Research's June 6 seminar, said at the meeting that \"unless we cause Chinese policy and action to fail, we are leaving all the leverage with Beijing, and we are waiting for our servicemen and women to be killed by the PLA. And that's not the future that I want.\"",

        "body": "Not even Russia's comprehensive strategic partner China wants that.\n\nIndia's new government will deal with a US which remains the world's top policeman, but one whose power has been diminished by the Israel-Hamas war because of its inability to control Israel's relentless flattening of Gaza, and Washington's incremental military aid to Ukraine. The latter has led Ukraine to lose the initiative it gained in repelling Russia's invasion in the first year of the war in 2022, and spurred Moscow to escalate the war and deliver several threats to use nuclear weapons, the last being on June 6.\n\nNot even Russia's comprehensive strategic partner China wants that. Additionally, Russia's assault on Ukraine has been prolonged because of China's diplomatic, economic, and -- it is whispered -- military support to Russia. India will continue to face the regional and global ramifications of that long war.\n\nAmerica is suffering from imperial overstretch and is finding it hard to cope with two hot wars -- one in Europe and the other in the Middle East. A third war is possible in the Asia-Pacific over Taiwan. Fear of that war impelled President Biden to withdraw American forces from Afghanistan in August 2021. That shambolic withdrawal encouraged Russia to assume that America was a do-nothing power and probably encouraged it to invade Ukraine. An end to the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza and Russia's war are unlikely in the foreseeable future. Both have international repercussions. Many Pacific Asians are concerned about the possible impact of America's reliability, especially if China invades Taiwan.\n\nWar clouds are hanging over Pacific Asia. As Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has repeatedly said, \"Today's Ukraine may be the East Asia of tomorrow.\" For America and its Pacific allies, including Japan, South Korea, the Philippines and Australia, it is essential to strengthen their security bonds.\n\nJapan is destined to become the world's third-largest military power within five years. The reasons include its technological advancement. In the field of technology, it is the only Asian country which can counter China.\n\nHopes of driving a wedge between China and Russia -- entertained by both India and America -- are unrealistic, given how much Beijing and Moscow have helped each other, especially over the last decade. Geographically Russia is a Eurasian power, and China a Pacific one. The Russia-China relationship has helped to make China an Arctic and Mediterranean power -- an achievement since China does not have any coastline in those areas. In contrast, Russia has coastal frontiers in Europe, the Baltic Sea region, the Mediterranean and Pacific. The wide-ranging strategic ties with Russia have also enabled China to strengthen its position in the Middle East-Suez area. All this has been possible because China's economic progress has empowered it to spread its military and economic tentacles worldwide.\n\nAs the senior partner in its relationship with Russia, China has been quick to show that it has the upper hand. Beijing does not want to buy as much Russian energy as Moscow would like and it wants to pay lower prices than Russia wants. But that will not upset their relationship because Ukraine-related Western sanctions on have made Russia too dependent on China.\n\nChina and Russia dislike the Quad, but Beijing is ultimately dismissive of the Quad which, because of a non-aligned India's membership, is not a force against China. It is more concerned about the militarisation of Japan and the strengthening of US alliances. While Beijing has congratulated Prime Minister Modi on his electoral success, the state-steered Global Times is dismissive of India's ability to compete economically with China. The paper identifies India's society, especially the caste system, as the reason behind the limited education of Indians, which \"directly impacts the overall labour productivity\". India's long-term rise as the \"world's factory\" will therefore be a long haul.\n\nFrom ambitious global manufacturing goals to various domestic issues, Modi will face hurdles \"not only about education levels but also cultural constraints\". The Global Times also sniggers at India's dependence on China for Chinese goods and raw materials even as Modi talks about replacing the neighbour in the global supply chain. India-China trade touched $118 billion last year.\n\nEconomically, India's absence from the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the largest regional economic pact in the world, shows its weakness against China. Vietnam, Indonesia, and Malaysia are all ahead of India. Free trade agreements (FTAs) with the European Free Trade Association and Australia cannot give India a strong regional or international presence. Talks with the European Union and Britain for FTAs have not made progress.\n\nGenerally, many multinationals are reluctant to leave China because of better investment conditions although labour is less expensive in India. Delhi pays scant attention to such complaints about investment conditions in India, which come even from some of its largest investors including Japan, America, and Germany.\n\nBig business friends of India's ruling establishment cannot cover up the problems stemming from a poorly educated workforce and the difficulties that small and medium enterprises confront in taking off. Protectionism leads many Indian manufacturers to dump shoddy goods on Indians -- and ultimately works against India gaining ground in world markets.\n\nIndo-US ties will continue to make progress, but India cannot help much in the Pacific -- which is the top priority of America and its allies as they gear up for war over Taiwan and confront China's claims to the South China Sea.\n\nAs geopolitical shifts trouble the world, India's economic interests will be served if it uses its diplomatic skills to help the international community to end the hot wars being fought in Ukraine and the Middle East.",

        "title": "India to rename two dozen places in Tibet Region",
        "body": "Girish Linganna\n\nIndia has initiated a retaliatory effort against China's renaming of locations in India's Arunachal Pradesh state. The Indian government intends to rename over two dozen places in China's Tibet Autonomous Region as a response.\n\nAccording to The Diplomat, a media organization, they have obtained a comprehensive list of the places that will be renamed in China's Tibet Autonomous Region. Indian military sources have provided this list, and it is anticipated that the official release will take place once the new government assumes power in Delhi, following the formation of the new government.\n\nStarting on June 8, Modi will serve his third term as Prime Minister with a smaller majority, necessitating reliance on coalition partners for governing. However, this reduced political space is unlikely to significantly affect foreign policy, as there is broad support across multiple political parties for Modi's objective of enhancing India's global influence and power.\n\nNew Delhi suspects that China's renaming of places in Arunachal Pradesh is an attempt to bolster Beijing's territorial claim on this large province in northeastern India, which China refers to as Zangnan or \"southern Tibet.\" This move is seen as an effort to assert control over the region and consolidate China's influence.\n\nAccording to The Diplomat, the Indian Army's information warfare division is believed to be responsible for the renaming of Tibetan places in Arunachal Pradesh. Additionally, with the support of renowned research institutes such as the Asiatic Society in Kolkata, the Indian Army has been actively disproving the legitimacy of the Chinese names by conducting thorough research. Their efforts aim to counter China's narrative and provide accurate information regarding the region.\n\nUnder its logo, the Indian Army has shared detailed tweets that challenge China's renaming of seven places in Arunachal Pradesh. Furthermore, they are actively working to counter the renaming of all the other 30 or so places that the Chinese government has renamed. The tweets aim to provide accurate information and refute China's attempts to assert control over these regions.\n\nIndia's military has recently compiled a list of over 30 places in Tibet that are set to be renamed. The objective behind this is to reclaim their ancient names in Indian languages, which are derived from historical records. This initiative aims to restore and recognize the historical significance of these places based on authentic sources.\n\nAccording to sources, this list of renamed places in Tibet will soon be made public through various media platforms. This is part of a larger global campaign aimed at presenting a compelling counter-narrative to China's claims on India's Arunachal Pradesh state and other disputed border regions. The intention is to showcase India's perspective and challenge China's assertions by providing alternative viewpoints and historical evidence.\n\nMilitary officials, who wished to remain anonymous, have stated that the new names given to these places are supported by thorough historical research. This signifies that considerable efforts have been made to ensure the accuracy and legitimacy of the chosen names.\n\nAccording to an Ex IB officer, if India proceeds with the renaming campaign, it would essentially reopen the issue of Tibet. Although India has recognized Tibet as part of China following its forcible occupation by Beijing, the current Modi government shows a willingness to change its stance in order to counter China's aggressive actions. This shift in approach reflects India's efforts to challenge China's territorial claims and renaming initiatives, as reported by The Diplomat.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Indian Army has arranged numerous media trips to the contested border regions. During these visits, journalists were given the opportunity to interact with local residents who strongly dispute China's claims and assert that their allegiance has always been to India. These efforts aim to showcase the perspective of the locals and highlight their unwavering support for India's sovereignty over these areas.\n\nAn officer involved in the campaign, who preferred to remain anonymous, stated that the primary objective is to promote India's counter-narrative regarding the disputed border. This would be achieved by leveraging regional and global media platforms and emphasizing both comprehensive historical research and the opinions of local residents. The aim is to establish a strong and credible narrative that supports India's perspective on the border issue.\n\nIn an apparent attempt to reinforce its territorial claim over Arunachal Pradesh, China renamed 30 locations along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in India's northeastern state in March. The Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs, responsible for naming administrative divisions, issued a list of \"standardized\" geographical names in Arunachal Pradesh, known as Zangnan in Beijing's terminology. This move by China was reported by the South China Morning Post, a Hong Kong-based newspaper.\n\nChina's renaming of locations in Arunachal Pradesh comprises a list that consists of 11 residential areas, 12 mountains, four rivers, one lake, one mountain pass, and a parcel of land. These new names are recorded in Chinese characters, Tibetan language, and pinyin, which is the Roman alphabet-based representation of Mandarin Chinese.\n\nQuoting the Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs, the South China Morning Post reported that the renaming of geographical names in Zangnan (Arunachal Pradesh) was carried out in accordance with regulations defined by China's cabinet, the State Council. The ministry, in collaboration with other relevant departments, stated that they standardized certain geographical names in the region based on these provisions.\n\nChina's decision to rename places in Arunachal Pradesh is not new, as this marks the fourth instance of such a unilateral action by Beijing. In 2017, the first list of six standardized names for locations in Arunachal Pradesh was released, followed by a second list in 2021 featuring 15 place names. In 2023, a third list was published, containing names for 11 places. However, the most recent fourth list is particularly significant, as it introduces nearly the same number of new place names as the previous three lists combined.\n\nIndia has consistently dismissed China's attempts to rename places in Arunachal Pradesh, affirming that the state is an intrinsic component of the nation. India maintains that the act of assigning \"invented\" names does not change the underlying reality of Arunachal Pradesh's status as an integral part of the country.\n\nIn 2023, the former spokesperson of India's External Affairs Ministry, Arindam Bagchi, expressed the country's response to the reports of China's renaming efforts. He straightforwardly rejected China's attempt, emphasizing that this was not the first time such actions were taken by China. India's outright rejection asserts its stance on the matter, asserting that it does not accept the validity or legitimacy of China's renaming endeavors.\n\nFurthermore, in response to China's latest round of efforts to assert its claims on Arunachal Pradesh, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the region in March 2024. During his visit, he inaugurated the Sela Tunnel constructed at an elevation of 13,000 feet. Beijing responded by filing a diplomatic protest with India.\n\nAddressing China's persistent claims on Arunachal Pradesh, India's External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar described them as \"ludicrous\" on March 23. He emphasized that the state was an inherent and natural part of India, firmly rejecting China's assertions.\n\nRegarding the issue of Arunachal Pradesh, India's External Affairs Minister responded that it is not a new matter. He highlighted that China's claims and attempts to expand those claims are baseless and continue to be deemed as ludicrous. He made these remarks while addressing a question on the Arunachal issue during a lecture at the esteemed Institute of South Asian Studies at the National University of Singapore. The minister emphasized India's steadfast position regarding the region's status.\n\nIn addition, the External Affairs Minister reiterated India's clear and unwavering stance on the matter, noting that it has remained consistent over time. He acknowledged that the issue of Arunachal Pradesh would be an integral part of the ongoing boundary discussions between the two countries. This statement reflects India's commitment to address the matter within the context of bilateral dialogues. (IPA)",

        "body": "This handout satellite image released by Maxar Technologies on March 24, 2024 and dated March 23, 2024 shows Chinese and Philippine ships in waters where the Philippines said the China Coast Guard blocked their supply vessel and damaged it with water cannon, during a Philippine supply mission near Second Thomas Shoal in disputed waters of the South China Sea. The Philippines said the China Coast Guard blocked a Filipino supply vessel and damaged it with water cannon on March 23, causing injuries near a reef off the Southeast Asian country. -- Agence France-Presse\n\nMANILA, Philippines -- The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy is conducting maritime exercises inside Manila's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) for the first time, increasing to 146 the number of Chinese vessels, among them 22 warships, spotted in several areas of the West Philippine Sea (WPS) since last week, according to the Armed Forces of the Philippines.\n\nAside from the 22 PLA Navy, 16 China Coast Guard (CCG) vessels and 108 Chinese maritime militia ships were monitored in the West Philippine Sea from June 4 to 10, data from the Philippine Navy showed.\n\nREAD: PH needs to brace for external threats - Marcos\n\nThe number of vessels in the West Philippine Sea was higher than the 125 ships monitored from May 28 to June 3.\n\nThe Navy said 50 Chinese vessels were seen at the vicinity of Ayungin (Second Thomas) Shoal, almost a month after CCG vessels seized supplies intended for troops deployed at the BRP Sierra Madre and blocked a medical evacuation of a sick Philippine Navy personnel at the grounded ship serving as the country's outpost.\n\nREAD: Insurgency ending but external threats rising, says Marcos as AFP told to adjust strategy\n\nOf the 50 vessels, eight were PLA Navy warships, an increase from the two warships monitored the previous week.\n\nAyungin is an underwater feature about 195 kilometers west of Palawan province, well within the country's 370-km EEZ.\n\nThe Navy said 42 Chinese vessels were at Pag-asa Island and 33 were at Panatag or Scarborough Shoal, while the remaining ships were at Kota, Likas, Lawak and Panata Islands and Sabina (Escoda) Shoal.\n\nMaritime drills\n\nOn Tuesday, Commodore Roy Vincent Trinidad, the Navy spokesperson on the West Philippine Sea, said the increase in Chinese warships in the West Philippine Sea from 11 to 22 could be attributed to the maritime drills being conducted by the PLA Navy in the vicinity of Sabina Shoal from June 4 to 11.\n\n\"This is the first time that we monitored an exercise by the PLA Navy within our [EEZ],\" Trinidad said at a press briefing in Camp Aguinaldo in Quezon City.\n\nHe noted that a landing ship, a warship, and two other support vessels were involved in the drills.\n\nThe PLA Navy, according to him, conducted launching and recovery of aircraft and hovercraft, among others.\n\nHe said China's drill at Sabina was not coordinated with the Philippine government, but noted that the Philippine military observed \"the conduct of their exercise and we checked on the details of their capabilities.\"\n\n\"The presence of the PLA Navy in Sabina is a reflection of their presence in the entire West Philippine Sea -- illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive,\" he said.\n\nAccording to him, there were many ways to prevent the exercises from being conducted in the country's EEZ.\n\n\"First and foremost, we inform everybody that it is illegal. They have no right to be here. We do not yet use force on force. There are many [ways] how to prevent or how to stop the actions of other countries, especially China,\" he said.\n\nNew Beijing policy\n\nThe increase in Chinese vessels in the West Philippine Sea happened days before the June 15 implementation of a new Beijing policy authorizing its coast guard to arrest trespassers who cross what it claims are its borders in the South China Sea.\n\nTrinidad said the military, the Navy and the Philippine Coast Guard were ready to prevent such a situation.\n\n\"We have increased patrols, we are involving our partners and allies, we are not the only ones concerned, even other countries are concerned about that. This is not only a problem of the Philippines, it is a problem of Asean and the international community,\" he said.\n\nOn Monday, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said the Philippines must be prepared because of more pronounced external threats as a result of the heightened geopolitical tension in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nIn his speech before members of Army's 5th Infantry Division (ID) at Camp Melchor Dela Cruz in Gamu, Isabela province, the President said the Philippines' northern part must be prepared \"for any eventuality\" due to its proximity to Taiwan, which puts the country in China's \"area of interest.\"\n\n\"And that is why -- the external threat now has become more pronounced, has become more worrisome. And that is why we have to prepare,\" President Marcos told 5th ID soldiers.\n\nNew Army mission\n\nIt was Mr. Marcos' first visit to the Army camp since it was chosen as one of the four new sites of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (Edca) with the United States.\n\nThe Marcos administration has added two other Edca sites in Cagayan province at the northern tip of the Luzon mainland.\n\nWith the current geopolitical tension in the Southeast Asian region, the AFP now has to take on two missions -- external and internal security, according to Mr. Marcos.\n\nHe said the 5th ID's mission now includes territorial defense from external threats, stressing the importance of providing the AFP with equipment, training and facilities to make it a highly capable force.\n\nThe President said that while the Philippines was not trying to expand its territory, its leadership had to reorient its thinking and adopt full commitment to defend the country's sovereign rights.\n\n\"We are not trying to take territory. We are not trying to redraw the lines of sovereign territory, the EEZ, the baseline,\" he said.\n\n\"We are not trying to change anything -- not even an inch. But we will also not allow that to be taken away from us,\" the President pointed out.\n\nThe national government has to undertake various efforts to maintain peace in the region, such as engaging in continued diplomacy, he said.",

        "title": "Be wary of US diplomacy setting traps in Asia - BLiTZ",
        "body": "The evolving geopolitical dynamics in Asia call for a nuanced understanding and cautious approach, especially in light of recent developments in Ukraine. Asian countries must remain vigilant against falling into a similar trap, one that appears to be set by the United States through its strategic maneuverings. The situation in Ukraine serves as a poignant reminder of the potential consequences of geopolitical entanglements, and Asia must tread carefully to avoid similar pitfalls.\n\nIn the past, the United States generally maintained a \"hands-off\" approach regarding territorial disputes in Asia. However, this stance has shifted significantly in recent years. Whenever a dispute involves China, the US invariably supports the opposing country, framing China as a regional \"bully\" and encouraging confrontation. This strategy is not dissimilar to the tactics employed in Eastern Europe, where NATO's expansion and US influence have been pivotal in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.\n\nFor instance, the longstanding maritime disputes in the South China Sea have been exacerbated by US involvement. The friction between China and the Philippines, particularly over the grounded Philippine warship on Ren'ai Jiao since 1999, has been a focal point of tension. Despite China's restraint, the US has emboldened the Philippines to adopt a more confrontational stance. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s actions and rhetoric, underpinned by US support, exemplify this shift. His recent speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue underscores this alignment, portraying the Philippines as a victim of Chinese aggression-a narrative strongly supported by the US.\n\nThe geopolitical landscape in Asia is far more intricate than in Europe, marked by numerous territorial disputes and maritime rights issues. Unlike Europe, Asia lacks a unified military alliance like NATO, and conflicts typically occur on a bilateral basis. However, the US seems intent on reshaping this dynamic by promoting a bloc mentality against China. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's remarks at the Shangri-La Dialogue, emphasizing the importance of alliances under the Indo-Pacific Strategy, clearly indicate this strategic direction.\n\nAustin's denial of NATO's role in the Ukraine crisis and his assertion that US security is intertwined with Asia's stability reflect a broader agenda. The US aims to foster a coalition of Asian countries to counter China, replicating the NATO model. This strategy, if successful, could lead to increased regional tensions and potential conflicts, mirroring the situation in Europe.\n\nThe presence of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the Shangri-La Dialogue should serve as a stark warning to Asian nations. Ukraine's current plight is a direct result of its entanglement with Western powers, particularly the US and NATO. While these alliances have provided support and assistance, it is ultimately the Ukrainian people who bear the brunt of the war. This scenario underscores the risks associated with aligning too closely with external powers, especially when it involves contentious regional disputes.\n\nAsian countries must heed this lesson and maintain strategic sobriety. The US's portrayal of China as an aggressor and its efforts to galvanize regional opposition are part of a broader hegemonic strategy. It is crucial for Asian nations to recognize that while the US may offer support, it is ultimately driven by its own strategic interests, which may not align with the long-term stability and prosperity of the region.\n\nTo avoid falling into the same trap as Ukraine, Asian countries must adopt a balanced approach to their foreign policy. This involves engaging with all major powers while prioritizing regional stability and peaceful resolution of disputes. Diplomatic efforts should focus on bilateral negotiations and multilateral frameworks that include China as a key stakeholder.\n\nMoreover, regional organizations such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) can play a pivotal role in mediating disputes and fostering cooperation. By strengthening these institutions and promoting dialogue, Asian countries can mitigate external influences and maintain control over their own geopolitical destinies.\n\nChina, for its part, must also continue to demonstrate restraint and a commitment to peaceful resolution of disputes. By engaging in constructive dialogue and building trust with its neighbors, China can counter the narrative of being a regional bully and foster a more cooperative regional environment.\n\nThe geopolitical landscape in Asia is at a critical juncture, and the lessons from Ukraine are both relevant and urgent. Asian countries must be wary of US diplomatic strategies that seek to replicate the European model of alliances and confrontations. By maintaining strategic autonomy, promoting regional cooperation, and engaging in peaceful dispute resolution, Asia can avoid the pitfalls that have ensnared Ukraine. The path forward requires a balanced and nuanced approach, one that prioritizes long-term stability and prosperity over short-term geopolitical gains.",
