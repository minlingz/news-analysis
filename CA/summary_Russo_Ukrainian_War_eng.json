As threats to peace and security become increasingly complex and attempts to destabilize our collective defence become more sophisticated, Canada and its NATO Allies are standing united - dedicated to defending democracy, security, and freedom.\n\nPrime Minister, Justin Trudeau, today announced he will travel to Washington, DC, United States of America, from July 8 to 11, 2024, to participate in this year's NATO Summit.\n\nThe NATO Alliance stands steadfast - protecting freedom and in defence of democracy. NATO was founded 75 years ago, and Canada has been part of nearly every operation in the Alliance. At this year's Summit, we will strengthen our work to uphold the global order that underpins our prosperity and sovereignty,\" Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada.\n\nThe Summit will be an opportunity for the prime minister to reaffirm Canada's commitment to Euro-Atlantic security and stability, particularly in the face of ongoing Russian aggression and destabilization. He will highlight Canada's contributions to NATO's collective defence efforts across Europe, including through Operation REASSURANCE , Canada's largest active overseas military deployment.\n\nAt the Summit, Prime Minister Trudeau will meet with NATO Allies and international partners to strengthen Euro-Atlantic security. Together, NATO leaders will explore ways to bolster collective deterrence and enhance defence capabilities and cooperation, while addressing other ongoing and emerging threats to the rules-based international order.\n\nWhile in Washington, the prime minister will meet with members of the United States Senate and House of Representatives to advance opportunities for Canadian businesses, workers, and communities across the country - as part of our Team Canada effort to promote and defend Canada's interests in and with the United States.\n\nPrime Minister Trudeau and NATO Allies will be joined by the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, for a NATO-Ukraine Council meeting focused on enhancing support for Ukraine and further responding to Russia's unjustifiable war of aggression.\n\nDuring this meeting, Prime Minister Trudeau will underline the importance of continued military, financial, and humanitarian support to Ukraine.

        "title": "NATO will strive to project unity at Washington summit, but cracks emerge",
        "body": "WASHINGTON -- The 32 members of the NATO military alliance will meet in Washington next week to project a united front on Ukraine and its fight against Russian aggression, but there could be some fractures behind the harmonious facade.\n\nBulgarian President Rumen Radev last week refused to lead his country's delegation to the NATO summit due to disagreements with Bulgaria's position in support of Ukraine.\n\nSlovakia's prime minister, Robert Fico, claimed last month that he was the target of an assassination attempt because his opposition to arming Ukraine deviated from the European mainstream.\n\nAnd Hungary has continued to maintain close ties with Russia and resist pressure to help Ukraine economically or militarily. Prime Minister Viktor Orban urged Ukraine on Tuesday to consider a cease-fire to speed up peace talks.\n\nMore cracks in the alliance could emerge Sunday with the potential electoral triumph of France's main far-right party. The party, National Rally, has a history of pro-Russia sympathies, and last year abstained in a vote on France's security pact with Ukraine.\n\nOutgoing NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg acknowledged the split in opinion on Ukraine in a news conference with Orban in June but expressed optimism in the alliance ultimately standing together in solidarity.\n\n\"We are 32 allies, and sometimes there are different opinions, but we have proven again and again that we are able to overcome them and find a common way forward,\" he said.\n\nOrban has assured NATO that Hungary will not oppose the expected announcement next week of a new mission in Germany to coordinate aid to Ukraine as well as a long-term financial pledge by the alliance to provide military support. But Orban also made clear that Hungary will not contribute personnel or funds for the efforts.\n\nFor now, any disagreements among NATO allies concerning Ukraine seem to be superficial cracks in the veneer of the alliance rather than at its foundations, according to Sean Monaghan, a U.K. visiting fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.\n\n\"Gaining consensus in the face of differing national positions on critical issues is normal business for NATO, and I would expect any cracks to be patched up by the time we get to Washington next week,\" he said.\n\nThe main aim of the summit will be to maintain and show unity, especially as the alliance marks a landmark 75th anniversary while war rages in Europe, and its largest member -- the United States -- moves into a highly consequential presidential election, Monaghan said.\n\nThe public is unlikely to see the kind of discord that accompanied last year's summit in Lithuania, when open debate about Ukraine's future with the alliance caused Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to lash out in frustration, he said.\n\n\"We won't see any last-minute debates in public this time. We'll see a unified position on Ukraine,\" Monaghan said.\n\nBehind the scenes, countries such as Hungary and Slovakia could cause problems, but the biggest sources of potential obstacles will be the U.S. and Germany, said Luke Coffey, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank.\n\n\"Hungary and Slovakia are very loud with their rhetoric, but behind closed doors, they tend to be more cooperative and pragmatic. If we wanted to do something with Ukraine inside NATO, and the only voice against it was Hungary's, there are ways to make Hungary come around,\" he said. \"But if Berlin or Washington is against something, they're too big. They're too big to try to influence or persuade.\"\n\nWashington and Berlin are \"dead set against\" extending an invitation for Ukraine to join NATO, he said. However, support for arming Ukraine to repel Russia's invasion remains strong in NATO and is unlikely to change in the near term.\n\n\"Is the political will still there to do this? So far, I think the answer is yes,\" Coffey said.\n\nThat resolve is expected to continue even as various countries head to the polls. Coffey noted widespread fears in 2022 that the election of far-right leader Giorgia Meloni as Italy's prime minister would spell disaster for Ukraine never came to pass.\n\n\"Now, Italy is one of the strongest advocates for arming Ukraine,\" he said.\n\nThe glue holding the NATO alliance together ultimately goes beyond each member nation's shifting politics, Monaghan said.\n\n\"NATO is an alliance of liberal democracies,\" he said. \"The democracies have elections, and the positions of allies change, but I don't think they change so fundamentally to turn cracks into massive fissures. NATO is an alliance that's built on a community of shared values. It always has been, and I think it will continue into the future.\"",

        "body": "The Department of Defense announced a $2.2 billion boost to Ukraine's air defenses on Wednesday, which includes missiles for the Patriot systems and National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS) already in Kyiv's possession.\n\nAccording to a release from the DOD, the additional interceptors will be purchased from U.S. manufacturers under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI). Both the Patriot and NASAMS systems have played a crucial role in Ukraine's ability to defend against Russian air attacks.\n\nThe Pentagon also announced a $150 million boost for Ukraine through the Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) package, which allows the DOD to draw directly from the U.S.'s stockpiles. The PDA package will include additional air defense interceptors, artillery and anti-tank weapons.\n\nAccording to the DOD's announcement, this is the 60th time that the Biden Administration has drawn from Washington's inventories for Ukraine since August 2021.\n\n\"Make no mistake, Ukraine is not alone, and the United States will never waver in our support,\" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said during a meeting with Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov at the Pentagon on Tuesday. \"Alongside some 50 allies and partners, we'll continue to provide critical capabilities that Ukraine needs to push back Russian aggression today and to deter Russian aggression tomorrow.\"\n\nUkraine is currently in possession of at least two Patriot missile defense systems -- one that was donated by the U.S., and another that was provided in partnership between Germany and the Netherlands. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that Kyiv needs at a \"minimum\" of \"seven more 'Patriots' or similar air defense systems\" in order to defend against Russia.\n\n\"[Russian President Vladimir] Putin must be brought down to earth, and our sky must become safe again...And it depends fully on your choice...[the] choice whether we are indeed allies,\" Zelensky during a speech to the NATO-Ukraine Council back in April, as reported by Reuters.\n\nThe U.S. first provided Ukraine with NASAMS systems in November 2022. Other NATO allies, including Norway and Lithuania, have also pledged to deliver defense launches to Ukraine.\n\nPurchasing additional interceptors through the USAI program takes longer than providing Ukraine with supplies under the PDA, although the Biden administration \"plans to accelerate delivery of [USAI] munitions by re-sequencing upcoming Foreign Military Sales deliveries for Ukraine,\" according to the Pentagon's release.\n\n\"As a result, Ukraine will be provided with the interceptors it urgently needs to protect its people and critical infrastructure against Russia's aerial attacks,\" the DOD added.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Ukraine's Ministry of Defense via email for additional comment.",

The state-run Việt Nam News said Vietnam had no criticism of Myanmar's decision 11 August 2009 to place Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest for the next 18 months, effectively barring her from elections scheduled for 2010. \"It is our view that the Aung San Suu Kyi trial is an internal affair of Myanmar\", Vietnamese government spokesman Le Dung stated on the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In contrast with other ASEAN member states, Dung said Vietnam has always supported Myanmar and hopes it will continue to implement the \"roadmap to democracy\" outlined by its government.\n\nNobel Peace Prize winners (Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the Dalai Lama, Shirin Ebadi, Adolfo Pérez Esquivel, Mairead Corrigan, Rigoberta Menchú, Prof. Elie Wiesel, US President Barack Obama, Betty Williams, Jody Williams and former US President Jimmy Carter) called for the rulers of Burma to release Aung San Suu Kyi to \"create the necessary conditions for a genuine dialogue with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and all concerned parties and ethnic groups to achieve an inclusive national reconciliation with the direct support of the United Nations\". Some of the money she received as part of the award helps fund London-based charity Prospect Burma, which provides higher education grants to Burmese students.\n\nThe US Government hoped that successful general elections would be an optimistic indicator of the Burmese government's sincerity towards eventual democracy. The Hatoyama government which spent 2.82 billion yen in 2008, has promised more Japanese foreign aid to encourage Burma to release Aung San Suu Kyi in time for the elections; and to continue moving towards democracy and the rule of law.\n\nIn a personal letter to Aung San Suu Kyi, UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown cautioned the Burmese government of the potential consequences of rigging elections as \"condemning Burma to more years of diplomatic isolation and economic stagnation\".\n\nSuu Kyi has met with many heads of state and opened a dialog with the Minister of Labor Aung Kyi (not to be confused with Aung San Suu Kyi). She was allowed to meet with senior members of her NLD party at the State House, however these meetings took place under close supervision.\n\nMay 30, 2015 ( Tony Cartalucci - NEO ) - As the plight of the Rohingya, driven from Myanmar into the sea, gains increasing international a...\n\n30 May 2015, Brian Berletic, May 30, 2015 (Tony Cartalucci - NEO) - As the plight of the Rohingya, driven from Myanmar into the sea, gains increasing international attention, the same familiar voices across the West have begun climbing upon their soapboxes and pointing fingers at each and every nation refusing to accept them upon their shores. What is not mentioned, conveniently, is who drove them into the sea to begin with.\n\nWho Are the Rohingya?\n\nThe Rohingya are a predominately Muslim people living in Myanmar's southwest state of Rakhine - and have lived there for generations. Many may be indigenous to Myanmar, having settled their centuries ago. Others may have come to Myanmar as a result of British rule during the 1800's.\n\nDespite the fact that they have lived in Myanmar for generations, they have suffered as a stateless people, with the political dynamics in Myanmar making it nearly impossible to grant them citizenship without considerable conflict and the threat of widespread violence.\n\nHowever, this is not because of the government of Myanmar will not grant them their citizenship.They have tried. It is the groups that have opposed Rohingya citizenship that has perpetuated this problem, groups the Western media has intentionally failed to expose and condemn.\n\nDemocracy Icon's \"Saffron\" Supporters\n\nThe group that is in fact driving the Rohingya from their homes in Myanmar and into the sea - and why this is not reported as the center of the current crisis - are the followers and supporters of the West's own \"patron saint of democracy,\" Aung San Suu Kyi.\n\nSuu Kyi herself, and many of the NGOs that support her and her political network are directly and substantially underwritten by the US and British governments.\n\nThese NGOs and faux-news agencies include the Irrawaddy, Era Journal, and the Democratic Voice of Burma (DVB), all admitted by the Burma Campaign UK (page 15) to be funded by the US National Endowment for Democracy (NED) along with \"Mizzima\" also fully funded by NED and convicted financial criminal George Soros' Open Society.\n\nThere is also the \"Burma Partnership\" which upon its \"About Us\" page is listed a myriad of associations and organizations directly linked to Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party, including the Students and Youth Congress of Burma, the Forum for Democracy in Burma, and the Nationalities Youth Forum, which is directly funded by the Euro-Burma Office (in turn funded by the EU, and US National Endowment for Democracy), and Open Society.\n\nThe heavily US-British-backed Nobel Peace Prize laureate's followers have prosecuted a campaign of ultra-racist genocide aimed at eradicating Myanmar entirely of the Rohingya people, often with orgies of machete-wielding brutality and neighborhood-wide arson leaving scores of people dead, and hundreds, sometimes thousands homeless, destitute, and above all, desperate.\n\nLeading the violence are Suu Kyi's \"saffron monks.\" The so-called \"Saffron Revolution\" of 2007 seeking to oust the Myanmar government and put into power Aung San Suu Kyi and her \"National League for Democracy\" was named so after the saffron-colored robes of these supporters.\n\nUnderneath the \"pro-democracy\" narrative, however, is an ugly truth that if known more widely amongst the global public, would spell the end of both Suu Kyi and her foreign backers' agenda in Myanmar.\n\nWhile the Western media attempts to shift the blame on the Myanmar government itself for the current Rohingya crisis, it was the government that attempted to grant the Rohingya citizenship through incremental programs that included allowing them to vote in upcoming elections. The plan was, however, disrupted by violence spearheaded by Suu Kyi's followers, as reported by Australia's ABC News article, \"Myanmar scraps temporary ID cards amid protests targeting ethnic minorities without citizenship.\"\n\nThe irony of Suu Kyi's supporters, supposedly representing a shining example of democracy worthy of a Nobel Peace Prize, attempting to deny hundreds of thousands of people their right to vote in elections is immeasurable.\n\nSuu Kyi, for her part, has remained utterly silent regarding the brutality and inhumanity of her most loyal and active supporters. While she is portrayed as a woman of courage and conviction, in reality these \"virtues\" were bought and paid for through millions of dollars of support for both her and her political network over the decades by the US and British governments. While her silence is shrugged off by the Western media as \"pragmatic\" and \"calculated,\" it is in reality merely her refusal to condemn the very supporters who have carved out a niche for her amid Myanmar's political landscape.\n\nThis carving has left a trail of blood and tears, one the Nobel Peace Prize has been shamefully used to distract the world's attention away from for years now.\n\nSuu Kyi's Followers Have Brutalized the Rohingya for Years\n\nAmong Suu Kyi's saffron butchers, there stands out one leader in particular, Wirathu. Wirathu has been involved in stirring up politically-motivated violence for over a decade. In particular, his group has carried out a bloody campaign against the Rohingya, even landing him in prison in 2003.\n\nThe International Business Times published an article titled, \"Burmese Bin Laden: Is Buddhist Monk Wirathu Behind Violence in Myanmar?\" explaining in further detail:\n\nThe shadow of controversial monk Wirathu, who has led numerous vocal campaigns against Muslims in Burma, looms large over the sectarian violence in Meikhtila.\n\nWirathu played an active role in stirring tensions in a Rangoon suburb in February, by spreading unfounded rumours that a local school was being developed into a mosque, according to the Democratic voice of Burma. An angry mob of about 300 Buddhists assaulted the school and other local businesses in Rangoon.\n\nThe monk, who describes himself as 'the Burmese Bin Laden' said that his militancy \"is vital to counter aggressive expansion by Muslims\".\n\nHe was arrested in 2003 for distributing anti-Muslim leaflets and has often stirred controversy over his Islamophobic activities, which include a call for the Rhohingya and \"kalar\", a pejorative term for Muslims of South Asian descent, to be expelled from Myanmar.\n\nHe has also been implicated in religious clashes in Mandalay, where a dozen people died, in several local reports.\n\nBy all accounts, Wirathu is a violent criminal leading mobs which have cost thousands of people their lives and has created a humanitarian crisis that is slowly engulfing all of Southeast Asia. Yet Wirathu is still counted among Suu Kyi's most vocal supporters and frequently weighs in on high level decisions made by Suu Kyi's political party. Furthermore, the West has failed to condemn him, place any sanctions upon him, and through their various media outlets, still grant him interviews, lending him continued credibility and influence.\n\nBeyond Wirathu, there are other \"monks\" who took to the streets in 2007's \"Saffron Revolution,\"a series of bloody anti-government protests in support of Aung San Suu Kyi. Human Rights Watch in a report titled \"Buddhism and activism in Burma\" (.pdf), would specifically enumerate support provided to Aung San Suu Kyi's movement by these organizations, including the Young Monks Union (Association), who are also now leading violence and calls for ethnic cleansing across Myanmar against the Rohingya people.\n\nThe UK Independent in their article, \"Burma's monks call for Muslim community to be shunned,\" mentions the Young Monks Association by name as involved in distributing flyers recently, demanding people not to associate with ethnic Rohingya, and attempting to block humanitarian aid from reaching Rohingya camps set up after being driven by their homes by violence.\n\nThe Independent also notes calls for ethnic cleansing made by leaders of the 88 Generation Students group (BBC profile here) - who also played a pivotal role in the pro-Suu Kyi 2007 protests. \"Ashin\" Htawara, another \"monk activist\" who considers Aung San Suu Kyi, his \"special leader\" and greeted her with flowers for her Oslo Noble Peace Prize address earlier this year, stated at an event in London that the Rohingya should be sent \"back to their native land.\"\n\nAre Myanmar's Neighbors to Blame?\n\nThis systematic genocidal brutality is what has driven the Rohingya to the seas from their rightful homes in Myanmar, scattering them abroad and creating a humanitarian crisis for other nations to bear. In particular, Myanmar's neighbor Thailand has been criticized vocally by the West as this crisis continues on, and more so now than ever since Thailand has ousted Washington and Wall Street's political order of choice there in a military coup in 2014.\n\nBut it is clear that the source of the problem is in Myanmar, and in particular the violence being used to drive the Rohingya from their homes. Myanmar's neighbors are but scapegoats for perpetrators not politically convenient for the Western media and the West's many so-called \"international\" institutions and rights organizations to name and shame. If anything, the perpetrators have created a political and humanitarian crisis regionally, giving the West an opportunity to meddle even further.\n\nRegardless of what Myanmar's neighbors do to assist Rohingya being driven from their homes, if the violence driving them abroad to begin with is not stopped, the humanitarian crisis will only continue to grow. Such violence, however, cannot be stopped so long as the self-proclaimed arbiters of international order and human rights not only refuse to condemn those guilty of precipitating this crisis, but in fact actively defend and support them.\n\nFor Southeast Asia, and in particular, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia - all nations targeted by the US and British with perpetual political meddling - exposing the true perpetrators of this crisis, and in particular the political order under which these perpetrators are operating, can expose Aung San Suu Kyi and her party and disrupt other foreign backed political proxies across the region like her. By doing so, perhaps an end can be brought to this current crisis today, and the next one prevented from unfolding tomorrow.\n\nThe Ronhingya are not \"stateless.\" They are not \"boat people.\" They are not \"without a home.\" Their home is Myanmar. Ultra-racist genocidal criminals, apparently with the support and blessing of the West, have driven them from that home.\n\nhttps://www.moonofalabama.org/2021/05/aiming-at-china-us-uk-launch-guerilla-war-on-myanmar.html\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20220116164718/https://www.moonofalabama.org/2021/05/aiming-at-china-us-uk-launch-guerilla-war-on-myanmar.html\n\nMay 06, 2021\n\nAiming At China U.S., UK Launch Ethnic Guerilla War On Myanmar\n\nIf you wonder what is happening in Myanmar there is no need to look further than these maps.\n\nChina needs oil but its sea main supply route through the Strait of Malacca is vulnerable.\n\nbigger\n\nPipelines through Pakistan and Myanmar provide for alternative routes.\n\nbigger\n\nThe pipe, road and rail lines through Myanmar are not only in China's best interest but also a great chance for Myanmar to further develop. They are in its [presumably meaning Myanmar's] national interest.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies are hostile to China. Threatening to cut its oil supplies is probably the most powerful tool in their box. Any alternative supply routes for China make this tool less powerful. The idea then is to prevent the possible use of these routes.\n\nSince its foundation after World War II Myanmar was ruled, sometimes more sometimes less brutal, by its anti-colonial military.\n\nThe first U.S. plan to gain control over Myanmar was to install a 'democratic government' that would do its bidding. In 2010, under pressure of U.S. instigated color revolutions, the military conceded to allow a civilian government but kept much of its constitutional and economic power. In 2016 the U.S. preferred candidate Suu Kyi, the daughter of the former military leader and Father of the Nation Aung San, was installed at the head of a new government.\n\nBut Aung San Suu Kyi turned out to be a nationalist and soon failed in the eyes of the U.S. regime changers. She was as friendly with China as the military and was equally aggressive against Myanmar's many ethnic minorities. Her eventual fall out with the military was not over those issues. The military owns key industries in Myanmar and Aung San Suu Kyi, and the 'civil society' people behind her, wanted a place at that trough.\n\nElections in 2020, which excluded voting in many ethnic regions, brought overwhelming support for Aung San Suu Kyi. This alarmed the military as it feared that its main source of income would soon be endangered. On February 1 it launched a coup and put Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest.\n\nThis brought a new chance for the U.S. to intervene. It immediately re-activated the 77 'civil society' organizations in Myanmar which it is financing through the CIA offshoot National Endowment for Democracy. Protest were launched together with attacks on Chinese companies and property.\n\nAs I described it at at that time:\n\nSo this is evidently a color revolution effort against the military.\n\nWhat is irritating with it is the speed with which it took off. Color revs usually require years of group building and leadership preparation. They need monetary and communication support as well as political directions from 'advisors' in 'western' embassies. Here it took only ten days to launch it.\n\nIn 2005 the Bush administration cultivated the Myanmar 'civil society' and Suu Kyi, who was then under house arrest. It popped up in the 'Saffron color revolution' in 2007 and with Cyclone Nargis in 2008 when the Bush administration tried to use Responsibility to Protect (R2P) nonsense to get a military foot on the ground.\n\nBut that all is a long time ago and after Suu Kyi had come to power there was no necessity to keep those efforts alive.\n\nThen again - under Myanmar's 2008 constitution the military was still effectively in charge. Together with Suu Kyi's large win in the latest election there may have been an long planned 'western' attempt underway to finally unseat the military from its privileged position and to pull the country out of China's orbit.\n\nBut the chance for that eventually to happen is practically zero. Some 70% of Myanmar's population lives in rural areas. The protests occur only in the three big cities Yangon, Mandalay and Naypyitaw and are relatively small. The military is ruthless and will have no trouble to take the protesters down.\n\nWhoever launched this nonsense should be held responsible for endangering those people.\n\nAs I predicted the protests, and the strikes the color revolution apparatus induced in form of a Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM), have since petered out:\n\nAlthough Thiha didn't want to abandon CDM, he also didn't want to lose his job amid a tanking economy. After weighing it up for a few days, he decided to get back to work.\n\n\"I have a loan from a microfinance company that I need to repay and a family to support - a wife and a five-year-old daughter,\" he said. \"It wouldn't be easy for me to get another job, particularly as I'd have to change my career.\"\n\nThere were just a handful of staff present when he turned up at his branch on April 20, but the number grew each day; by the April 29 deadline, about 80 percent had returned, although they were not yet wearing their KBZ uniforms.\n\nIt's a scene being repeated around the country, as tens of thousands of striking bank workers slowly get back to work.\n\nThis U.S. induced color revolution attempt against the military coup has failed.\n\nNow it is time for plan B - the Syria model: \"If we can't have it we will destroy it!\"\n\nA major Burmese ethnic rebel group has claimed to have shot down a helicopter belonging to the country's military. The incident comes amid continuing protests against the recent coup that ousted Myanmar's civilian government.\n\nThe Kachin Independence Army (KIA) said the helicopter had been shot down on Monday in Myanmar's northernmost province of Kachin. The aircraft is said to have been destroyed after Myanmar's military launched airstrikes against the rebels. ...\n\nFootage circulating online shows the helicopter - likely a Mi-17 transport-assault aircraft - sustaining an apparent hit from a portable anti-aircraft missile launcher.\n\nThe Kachin (red) in the north east and the Karen (orange) in the south east have a long history of fighting against the Burman (dark violet) majority and for autonomy within Myanmar. During World War II Burma's National Army under Aung San fought on the side of Japan to kick the colonial power Britain out of Burma. Britain, which at that time also controlled India, used the Kachin and Karen to wage a guerilla war against Japan's Burmese proxy forces.\n\nbigger\n\nUnder the great Quad project to fight China those old ties have now been reactivated. Former Indian ambassador M.K. Bhadrakumar explains the project:\n\n[T]he operative part hidden from view concentrated on the creation of a \"government-in-exile\" (a National Unity Government.) Alongside, Britain's MI6 sought to bring together Myanmar's main ethnic separatist guerrilla groups, encouraging them to take advantage of the chaos to open a second front.\n\nIndeed, some degree of proximity has since developed between the Burman protesters in Yangon and Mandalay on one side and the non-Burman minority ethnic groups on the other side. Despite a history of mutual antipathy, they have a convergence today to bleed the military. It is an improbable coalition of Buddhists and Christians, but as an American analyst cautiously assesses, it is doable: ...\n\nAt any rate, by mid-April, the first major armed attack on the military took place by the Karen National Union, Myanmar's oldest rebel group (which was originally created by the British colonial power as its proxy.) Such attacks have since become commonplace.\n\nToday, the so-called National Unity Government announced its intention to establish a Federal Union Army -- a military force of defectors from the security forces, rebel ethnic groups and volunteers. This would be a watershed transforming the anti-military agitation to an armed confrontation with the military. Myanmar is entering the crucial stage where Syria stood in 2011.\n\nThe Man Portable Air Defense (Manpad) missile used by the Kachin against a Myanmar army helicopter did not come out of nowhere.\n\nIt must have come from the MI6 or CIA through Myanmar's wide open borders with Quad member India. (Fielding provisions for the Karen near the Thai border are likely more complicate as the Thai military is itself under U.S. color revolution pressure and would not like to help with such efforts.)\n\nThere are more ethnic groups on both sides of the Indian border that can and will be used to wage a guerrilla war against Myanmar's military. With free supplies of modern weapons available to them they can create significant damage.\n\nMeanwhile the Juan Guaido like exile 'National Unity Government' will be used to pretend that there is real opposition to the military government. The 'Federal Union Army' will be a copy of the 'Syrian National Army' - a lose assembly of mercenaries and diverse warlord groups. 'White Helmets' like propaganda organization will likely also soon appear.\n\nThe hope is to ignite a wide ranging civil war that will make any Chinese projects in Myanmar impossible to implement.\n\nBhadrakumar finds that the project is well coordinated:\n\nThe US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with his Indian counterpart S. Jaishankar not less than three times in as many months since the military takeover in Myanmar. To be sure, India's cooperation is crucial for the success of the Anglo-American enterprise in Myanmar.\n\nMyanmar figured prominently at the G7 foreign ministers' meeting in London on May 3-5. Jaishankar travelled to London and met with Blinken. Neither side divulged details, but a Deutsche-Welle report flagged that \"China was at the top of the agenda as the G7 foreign ministers discussed a range of human rights issues. Addressing the Myanmar coup and Russian aggression was also on the docket.\"\n\nIt added that the G7 ministers watched a video from Myanmar's National Unity Government to \"update the ministers with the current situation on the ground.\" The joint communique issued after the London meeting devotes much attention to Myanmar (paras 21-24). It expresses \"solidarity\" with the National Unity Government and issues call for comprehensive sanctions against the Myanmar military, including an arms embargo.\n\nThe birth pangs of insurgencies are never open to public view, as intelligence agencies get the actors into play. The Myanmar situation has reached that point. This is the first big bash of post-Brexit UK (\"Global Britain\") on the world stage. As so often in modern history, London will lead from the rear.\n\nCountermoves to the U.S. and UK plans will come from Russia and China. A week before the coup Russia's Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu had visited Myanmar. On March 27 Russia's deputy defense minister Alexander Fomin was present at the annual Armed Forces Day parade in Naypyidaw.\n\nRussia has oil interests in Myanmar and sells weapons to its military. It is preventing any measures against Myanmar at the UN Security Council. In a sign that it knows what's at stake it has warned that sanctions against the military could lead to a full blown civil war.\n\nChina has so far stayed quiet on the issue. It will try to keep a low profile. Any open Chinese intervention is out of question but Chinese help may become important if or when Myanmar's government comes under financial stress.\n\nIt is sad to see that another little country, which wants nothing but to be left alone, will soon get destroyed in the 'western' attempt to keep China down. A proxy war between great powers no one but already rich people will benefit from.\n\nInvestigative historian Eric Zuesse's latest book, AMERICA'S EMPIRE OF EVIL: Hitler's Posthumous Victory, and Why the Social Sciences Need to Change, is about how America took over the world after World War II in order to enslave it to U.S.-and-allied billionaires. Their cartels extract the world's wealth by control of not only their 'news' media but the social 'sciences' -- duping the public.\n\nfrom https://theduran.com/how-the-u-s-empires-war-against-china-is-being-waged-in-myanmar-burma/",

        "summary": "The article discusses the geopolitical conflict in Myanmar, highlighting the involvement of the U.S. and its allies in a proxy war against China. Key points include:\n\n1. **Geopolitical Context**: The U.S. and UK are allegedly using Myanmar as a battleground to counter China's influence, particularly targeting China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects, which include vital pipelines through Myanmar.\n\n2. **Historical Background**: Myanmar has a history of military rule, with a brief period of civilian government led by Aung San Suu Kyi from 2016 to 2021. Suu Kyi, despite being a Nobel laureate, has been criticized for her handling of ethnic conflicts, particularly involving the Rohingya.\n\n3. **Ethnic Conflicts**: The article accuses Suu Kyi's supporters and Western-backed NGOs of perpetuating violence against the Rohingya, a Muslim minority in Myanmar, leading to a humanitarian crisis.\n\n4. **Recent Developments**: Following a military coup in February 2021, the U.S. allegedly reactivated civil society organizations to instigate protests and attacks on Chinese interests in Myanmar. The situation has escalated into armed conflict involving ethnic rebel groups like the Kachin and Karen.\n\n5. **International Involvement**: The U.S. and UK are accused of supporting a \"National Unity Government\" in exile and encouraging ethnic insurgencies to destabilize Myanmar. Russia and China are positioned as counterforces, with Russia providing military support to Myanmar's government.\n\n6. **Implications**: The conflict is seen as part of a broader strategy to limit China's regional influence, with significant humanitarian and geopolitical consequences for Southeast Asia.\n\nThe article suggests that the U.S. and its allies are using Myanmar as a proxy to weaken China's strategic position, leading to increased violence and instability in the region."

        "body": "The motorcycle's growling engine was no match for the silent drone as it stalked Babenko. \"Push, push more. Pedal to the metal, man,\" his colleagues called out over a walkie-talkie as the drone swooped toward him. \"You're screwed, screwed!\"\n\nIf the drone had been armed with explosives, and if his colleagues hadn't disengaged the autonomous tracking, Babenko would have been a goner.\n\nVyriy is just one of many Ukrainian companies working on a major leap forward in the weaponization of consumer technology, driven by the war with Russia. The pressure to outthink the enemy, along with huge flows of investment, donations and government contracts, has turned Ukraine into a Silicon Valley for autonomous drones and other weaponry.\n\nWhat the companies are creating is technology that makes human judgment about targeting and firing increasingly tangential. The widespread availability of off-the-shelf devices, easy-to-design software, powerful automation algorithms and specialized artificial intelligence microchips has pushed a deadly innovation race into uncharted territory, fueling a potential new era of killer robots.\n\nThe most advanced versions of the technology that allows drones and other machines to act autonomously have been made possible by deep learning, a form of AI that uses large amounts of data to identify patterns and make decisions. Deep learning has helped generate popular large language models, like OpenAI's GPT-4, but it also helps make models interpret and respond in real time to video and camera footage. That means software that once helped a drone follow a snowboarder down a mountain can now become a deadly tool.\n\nIn more than a dozen interviews with Ukrainian entrepreneurs, engineers and military units, a picture emerged of a near future when swarms of self-guided drones can coordinate attacks and machine guns with computer vision can automatically shoot down soldiers. More outlandish creations, like a hovering unmanned copter that wields machine guns, are also being developed.\n\nThe weapons are cruder than the slick stuff of science-fiction blockbusters, like \"The Terminator\" and its T-1000 liquid-metal assassin, but they are a step toward such a future. While these weapons aren't as advanced as expensive military-grade systems made by the United States, China and Russia, what makes the developments significant is their low cost -- just thousands of dollars or less -- and ready availability.\n\nExcept for the munitions, many of these weapons are built with code found online and components such as hobbyist computers, like Raspberry Pi, that can be bought from Best Buy and a hardware store. Some U.S. officials said they worried that the abilities could soon be used to carry out terrorist attacks.\n\nFor Ukraine, the technologies could provide an edge against Russia, which is also developing autonomous killer gadgets -- or simply help it keep pace. The systems raise the stakes in an international debate about the ethical and legal ramifications of AI on the battlefield. Human rights groups and United Nations officials want to limit the use of autonomous weapons for fear that they may trigger a new global arms race that could spiral out of control.\n\nIn Ukraine, such concerns are secondary to fighting off an invader.\n\n\"We need maximum automation,\" said Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine's minister of digital transformation, who has led the country's efforts to use tech startups to expand advanced fighting capabilities. \"These technologies are fundamental to our victory.\"\n\nAutonomous drones like Vyriy's have already been used in combat to hit Russian targets, according to Ukrainian officials and video verified by The New York Times. Fedorov said the government was working to fund drone companies to help them rapidly scale up production.\n\nMajor questions loom about what level of automation is acceptable. For now, the drones require a pilot to lock onto a target, keeping a \"human in the loop\" -- a phrase often invoked by policymakers and AI ethicists. Ukrainian soldiers have raised concerns about the potential for malfunctioning autonomous drones to hit their own forces. In the future, constraints on such weapons may not exist.\n\nUkraine has \"made the logic brutally clear of why autonomous weapons have advantages,\" said Stuart Russell, an AI scientist and professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who has warned about the dangers of weaponized AI. \"There will be weapons of mass destruction that are cheap, scalable and easily available in arms markets all over the world.\"\n\nIn a ramshackle workshop in an apartment building in eastern Ukraine, Dev, a 28-year-old soldier in the 92nd Assault Brigade, has helped push innovations that turned cheap drones into weapons. First, he strapped bombs to racing drones, then added larger batteries to help them fly farther and recently incorporated night vision so the machines can hunt in the dark.\n\nIn May, he was one of the first to use autonomous drones, including those from Vyriy. While some required improvements, Dev said, he believed that they would be the next big technological jump to hit the front lines.\n\nAutonomous drones are \"already in high demand,\" he said. The machines have been especially helpful against jamming that can break communications links between drone and pilot. With the drone flying itself, a pilot can simply lock onto a target and let the device do the rest.\n\nMakeshift factories and labs have sprung up across Ukraine to build remote-controlled machines of all sizes, from long-range aircraft and attack boats to cheap kamikaze drones -- abbreviated as FPVs, for first-person view, because they are guided by a pilot wearing virtual-reality-like goggles that give a view from the drone. Many are precursors to machines that will eventually act on their own.\n\nEfforts to automate FPV flights began last year, but were slowed by setbacks building flight control software, according to Fedorov, who said those problems had been resolved. The next step was to scale the technology with more government spending, he said, adding that about 10 companies were already making autonomous drones.\n\n\"We already have systems which can be mass-produced, and they're now extensively tested on the front lines, which means they're already actively used,\" Fedorov said.\n\nSome companies, like Vyriy, use basic computer vision algorithms, which analyze and interpret images and help a computer make decisions. Other companies are more sophisticated, using deep learning to build software that can identify and attack targets. Many of the companies said they pulled data and videos from flight simulators and front-line drone flights.\n\nOne Ukrainian drone maker, Saker, built an autonomous targeting system with AI processes originally designed for sorting and classifying fruit. During the winter, the company began sending its technology to the front lines, testing different systems with drone pilots. Demand soared.\n\nBy May, Saker was mass-producing single-circuit-board computers loaded with its software that could be easily attached to FPV drones so the machines could auto-lock onto a target, said the company's CEO, who asked to be referred to only by his first name, Viktor, for fear of retaliation by Russia.\n\nThe drone then crashes into its target \"and that's it,\" he said. \"It resists wind. It resists jamming. You just have to be precise with what you're going to hit.\"\n\nSaker now makes 1,000 of the circuit boards a month and plans to expand to 9,000 a month by the end of the summer. Several of Ukraine's military units have already hit Russian targets on the front lines with Saker's technology, according to the company and videos confirmed by the Times.\n\nIn one clip of Saker technology shared on social media, a drone flies over a field scarred by shelling. A box at the center of the pilot's viewfinder suddenly zooms in on a tank, indicating a lock. The drone attacks on its own, exploding into the side of the armor.\n\nSaker has gone further in recent weeks, successfully using a reconnaissance drone that identified targets with AI and then dispatched autonomous kamikaze drones for the kill, Viktor said. In one case, the system struck a target 25 miles away.\n\n\"Once we reach the point when we don't have enough people, the only solution is to substitute them with robots,\" said Rostyslav, a Saker co-founder who also asked to be referred to only by his first name.\n\nOn a hot afternoon last month in the eastern Ukrainian region known as the Donbas, Yurii Klontsak, a 23-year-old reservist, trained four soldiers to use the latest futuristic weapon: a gun turret with autonomous targeting that works with a PlayStation controller and a tablet.\n\nSpeaking over booms of nearby shelling, Klontsak explained how the gun, called Wolly after a resemblance to the Pixar robot WALL-E, can auto-lock on a target up to 1000 meters away and jump between preprogrammed positions to quickly cover a broad area. The company making the weapon, DevDroid, was also developing an auto-aim to track and hit moving targets.\n\n\"When I first saw the gun, I was fascinated,\" Klontsak said. \"I understood this was the only way, if not to win this war, then to at least hold our positions.\"\n\nThe gun is one of several that have emerged on the front lines using AI-trained software to automatically track and shoot targets. Not dissimilar to the object identification featured in surveillance cameras, software on a screen surrounds humans and other would-be targets with a digital box. All that's left for the shooter to do is remotely pull the trigger with a video game controller.\n\nFor now, the gunmakers say they do not allow the machine gun to fire without a human pressing a button. But they also said it would be easy to make one that could.\n\nMany of Ukraine's innovations are being developed to counter Russia's advancing weaponry. Ukrainian soldiers operating machine guns are a prime target for Russian drone attacks. With robot weapons, no human dies when a machine gun is hit. New algorithms, still under development, could eventually help the guns shoot Russian drones out of the sky.\n\nSuch technologies, and the ability to quickly build and test them on the front lines, have gained attention and investment from overseas. Last year, Eric Schmidt, a former Google CEO, and other investors set up a firm called D3 to invest in emerging battlefield technologies in Ukraine. Other defense companies, such as Helsing, are also teaming up with Ukrainian firms.\n\nUkrainian companies are moving more quickly than competitors overseas, said Eveline Buchatskiy, a managing partner at D3, adding that the firm asks the companies it invests in outside Ukraine to visit the country so they can speed up their development.\n\n\"There's just a different set of incentives here,\" she said.\n\nOften, battlefield demands pull together engineers and soldiers. Oleksandr Yabchanka, a commander in Da Vinci Wolves, a battalion known for its innovation in weaponry, recalled how the need to defend the \"road of life\" -- a route used to supply troops fighting Russians along the eastern front line in Bakhmut -- had spurred invention. Imagining a solution, he posted an open request on Facebook for a computerized, remote-controlled machine gun.\n\nIn several months, Yabchanka had a working prototype from a firm called Roboneers. The gun was almost instantly helpful for his unit.\n\n\"We could sit in the trench drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes and shoot at the Russians,\" he said.\n\nYabchanka's input later helped Roboneers develop a new sort of weapon. The company mounted the machine gun turret atop a rolling ground drone to help troops make assaults or quickly change positions. The application has led to a bigger need for AI-powered auto-aim, Roboneers CEO Anton Skrypnyk said.\n\nSimilar partnerships have pushed other advances. On a drone range in May, Swarmer, another local company, held a video call with a military unit to walk soldiers through updates to its software, which enables drones to carry out swarming attacks without a pilot.\n\nThe software from Swarmer, which was formed last year by a former Amazon engineer, Serhii Kupriienko, was built on an AI model that was trained with large amounts of data on front-line drone missions. It enables a single technician to operate up to seven drones on bombing and reconnaissance missions.\n\nRecently, Swarmer added abilities that can guide kamikaze attack drones up to 35 miles. The hope is that the software, which has been in tests since January, will cut down on the number of people required to operate the miniaturized air forces that dominate the front lines.\n\nDuring a demonstration, a Swarmer engineer at a computer watched a map as six autonomous drones buzzed overhead. One after the other, large bomber drones flew over a would-be target and dropped water bottles in place of bombs.\n\nSome drone pilots are afraid they will be replaced entirely by the technology, Kupriienko said.\n\n\"They say: 'Oh, it flies without us. They will take away our remote controls and put a weapon in our hand,'\" he said, referring to the belief that it's safer to fly a drone than occupy a trench on the front.\n\n\"But I say, no, you'll now be able to fly with five or 10 drones at the same time,\" he said. \"The software will help them fight better.\"\n\nIn 2017, Russell, the Berkeley AI researcher, released an online film, \"Slaughterbots,\" warning of the dangers of autonomous weapons. In the movie, roving packs of low-cost armed AI drones use facial recognition technology to hunt down and kill targets.\n\nWhat's happening in Ukraine moves us toward that dystopian future, Russell said. He is already haunted, he said, by Ukrainian videos of soldiers who are being pursued by weaponized drones piloted by humans. There's often a point when soldiers stop trying to escape or hide because they realize they cannot get away from the drone.\n\n\"There's nowhere for them to go, so they just wait around to die,\" Russell said.\n\nHe isn't alone in fearing that Ukraine is a turning point. In Vienna, members of a panel of U.N. experts also said they worried about the ramifications of the new techniques being developed in Ukraine.\n\nOfficials have spent more than a decade debating rules about the use of autonomous weapons, but few expect any international deal to set new regulations, especially as the United States, China, Israel, Russia and others race to develop even more advanced weapons. In one U.S. program announced in August, known as the Replicator initiative, the Pentagon said it planned to mass-produce thousands of autonomous drones.\n\n\"The geopolitics makes it impossible,\" said Alexander Kmentt, Austria's top negotiator on autonomous weapons at the U.N. \"These weapons will be used, and they'll be used in the military arsenal of pretty much everybody.\"\n\nNobody expects countries to accept an outright ban of such weapons, he said, \"but they should be regulated in a way that we don't end up with an absolutely nightmare scenario.\"\n\nGroups including the International Committee of the Red Cross have pushed for legally binding rules that prohibit certain types of autonomous weapons, restrict the use of others and require a level of human control over decisions to use force.\n\nFor many in Ukraine, the debate is academic. They are outgunned and outmanned.\n\n\"We need to win first,\" said Fedorov, the minister of digital transformation. \"To do that, we will do everything we can to introduce automation to its maximum to save the lives of our soldiers.\"\n\nWritten by: Paul Mozur and Adam Satariano",

Since October 2023, Qatar's continuous efforts in bringing the sides to the conflict together for talks and bridging gaps between the two parties cannot be understated, he added.\n\nThe ambassador also expressed his gratitude for Qatar's noble humanitarian efforts by stating, \"I cannot but mention that, thanks to our Qatari friends good offices, a number of Russian families separated by the conflict in Ukraine have been reunited, and were graciously hosted in Doha in April to partake in a programme of rehabilitation.\"\n\nMediation requires great patience and tactfulness to be successful. It is not for everyone, but Qatar has proved its capabilities in this regard. Thanks to its proactive foreign policy, it has soared very high both regionally and internationally, he highlighted.\n\n\"The Qatari leadership has set an ambitious goal for Qatar to become an indispensable, 'one-of-a-kind' mediator with a worldwide portfolio. I wholeheartedly believe that Qatar's capability and dedication match the ambitiousness of this noble goal,\" he said.\n\nChinese ambassador to Qatar Cao Xiaolin emphasised his country's great interest in developing relations with Qatar and its readiness to co-operate with the country in enhancing the role of the SCO, after officially becoming a dialogue partner of the SCO in 2022. This comes as China prepares to assume the rotating presidency of the SCO following the SCO Summit in Kazakhstan.\n\n\"Qatar holds significant influence in the Arab world and is an important member of numerous international organisations, actively contributing to regional stability and friendly cooperation among nations. In September 2022, Qatar officially became a Dialogue Partner of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), which is warmly welcomed by China,\" the ambassador said in an interview, adding that Qatar has actively engaged in SCO-related activities.\n\nChina looks forward to working with Qatar to enhance its role in the SCO based on mutual trust, mutual benefit, respect for diverse civilizations, pursuit of common development, and strive for international and regional peace and development, he added.\n\nIn regard to China's view of Qatar's success in mediating conflicts in numerous regions worldwide, \" Over the past three decades, Qatar has successfully mediated dozens of conflicts in the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and Europe, contributing to the de-escalation of tensions, effective settlement of conflicts, and facilitating family reunions for displaced individuals. These efforts have received high praises from the international community, and mediation diplomacy has become a shining hallmark of Qatar on the global stage,\" he said.\n\nDespite the ongoing war in Gaza, Qatar's relentless efforts to promote ceasefire agreements have been highly commended by the international community, the ambassador highlighted.\n\nIndian ambassador to Qatar Vipul highlighted Qatar's accession to the SCO, pointing out that hopes are rising that Qatar will contribute effectively to promoting the organisation's goals.\n\nSpeaking to Qatar News Agency (QNA), the ambassador said: \"India held the presidency of SCO for the first time last year and promoted the theme of SCO-SECURE which stands for Security, Economic development, Connectivity, Unity, Respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity and Environmental protection. We hope to continue our work on all these themes in SCO, including with Qatar.\"\n\n\"We believe that dialogue and diplomacy are the best way of enhancing international peace and security. Qatar's active regional and international diplomacy is well acknowledged across the world. We have always appreciated the deep insights shared by Qatar on the regional situation,\" he added.\n\nAmbassador of the Kyrgyz Republic Marat Nuraliev confirmed that Qatar has proven itself as a very honest mediator who seeks to resolve conflicts in the world fairly, which has led to strengthening its position in the region and the whole world.\n\nIn remarks to QNA, he said that Qatar's accession to the SCO allows it to participate in relevant events within the organization at the invitation of member states.\n\nHe added that within the framework of the organization, mutual trust, friendship, and cooperation can be strengthened with member states, as well as dialogue partner countries, including Qatar, to maintain and enhance peace, security, and stability in the region.\n\nTajik ambassador Nurmurod Mahmadali emphasised that Tajikistan is keen on supporting Qatar's initiatives within the framework of the SCO, noting the steadfast development in the bilateral relations across various fields supported by the leadership of the two friendly countries.\n\nIn his remarks to QNA, the ambassador said that Qatar has become an active member within the SCO, as Tajikistan has supported its accession process from the beginning. He added that Tajikistan is counting on Qatar to work with the member states of the organisation to carry out joint activities of a political, economic, and humanitarian nature.\n\nUzbekistan's ambassador Ashraf Khodjaev said that Qatar's accession to the SCO as a dialogue partner came as a result of its robust economy and visionary investment strategy which prioritises innovation and sustainability in sectors like renewable energy, infrastructure and digital technology.\n\nIn a statement to QNA, the ambassador said that the country fully supports Qatar's accession to the SCO, stressing that Qatar's open and balanced foreign policy promotes peace and stability globally, avoiding international or regional conflicts and disputes with neighbors.\n\nKhodjaev noted that Qatar shares the SCO's core principles of non-alignment, openness, equality and counter-based decision-making, adding that the country's involvement will help achieve the SCO's goals.\n\nHe said that Qatar, under the wise and visionary leadership of His Highness the Amir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani has established itself as a key player regionally and internationally, particularly through its successful mediations in global disputes. He pointed out that Qatar's diplomatic approach and strategic initiatives have earned a strong reputation for promoting peace and stability in conflict-ridden areas.",

        "title": "European Commission Competition Report Spotlights Potential Areas of Focus for Next Commissioner",
        "body": "Last week, the European Commission (EC) Directorate-General for Competition published a staff report on 'Protecting competition in a changing world: Evidence on the evolution of competition in the EU during the past 25 years'. We have read the report and believe that one can distill from it several principles that may guide competition policy in the next Commission:\n\nThe report appears to be the latest salvo in DG Competition's attempts to stave off dilution of its competition powers. The last significant part of this effort was passage of the Foreign Subsidies Regulation, which was borne in part out of a desire to avoid polluting competition policy with the political fallout which accompanied the Commission's block of the Alstom-Siemens merger (which was characterized as a merger of French and German \"champions\" to meet competition alleged to arise from government-subsidized Chinese manufacturers).\n\nThe report signals that the Commission's focus will be on the protection of competition and innovation competition (i.e., dynamic competition), particularly in sectors with existing high levels of concentration and clear signs of market power.\n\nThe report's conclusions in relation to lower income households and consumer-facing sectors suggest that these will be critical areas of focus for antitrust and merger enforcement going forward, with a potential goal of increasing the purchasing power of consumers to both reverse trends at the macro-economic level and improve competition. We expect that the EC may focus on these sectors in its enforcement strategy to send a message to other market participants.\n\nSpecifically for private equity deals, the report asserts that common ownership has been a structural driver for purported negative changes to competition, indicating a belief that common ownership (even at small minority levels) can influence competitive dynamics.\n\nWe do not expect any major changes in substance to the EC's approach in merger review. For antitrust enforcement, however, the report suggests a willingness to consider novel theories of harm whilst being open to discussion on effective remedies to protect innovation competition.\n\nBackground and summary of report\n\nThe Commission's report assesses the conditions of competition in the EU over the last 25 years and the main drivers of change, presenting new findings based on extensive economic research on the impacts on overall economic growth. The Commission draws on contributions from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a consortium of researchers led by economics consultancy Lear, and by the Chief Economist's team within DG Competition itself. It provides an update on the current factors affecting competition in the EU, the key drivers for this, and the impact of competition on economic outcomes.\n\nThe report, which was presented and discussed at a conference hosted by the EC on 27 June 2024, comes at a crucial political juncture for Europe. In particular, current European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will soon need confirmation from the European Parliament to renew her mandate. The vote is likely to be close. In exchange for supporting President von der Leyen, certain members of the European Parliament will likely seek concessions and there likely will be calls for a more interventionist industrial policy and more 'benign' enforcement of competition policy. These calls will likely be echoed in a report on European competitiveness expected to be issued by Mario Draghi (the former Italian Prime Minister and European Central Bank President) at the end of July. All of this will inform the selection of the next Competition Commissioner, the hearings in European Parliament of Commissioner-designates, and the EC's key policy priorities for the next five years. Indeed, there has already been mounting pressure to relax competition law enforcement in the next commissioner's mandate -- notably in the area of mergers, but also in relation to state aid. The report, however, may be one means by which current Commissioner Margrethe Vestager will try to resist this pressure.\n\nKey findings of the report\n\nOverall, the report finds weaker intensity of competition in the EU than in the past, with more pronounced market power and profit for firms at the top. However, the Commission caveats this with the finding that such weakened competition is still less pronounced than in other economies such as the United States.\n\nChanges to competitive intensity have been driven by both structural and institutional changes to how firms create value and compete in today's economy. The EC addresses how technological innovation, digitisation of business, public policies, and transformation in global supply chains (exemplified by China's re-integration into global trade) have changed the dynamics of trade and competition.\n\nThe second part of the report confirms and supplements prior findings that competition can have effects on prices and purchasing power of consumers, competitiveness of EU firms and overall economic growth. This is correlated to productivity, the most important factor for overall competitiveness and economic growth, with the research estimating that increased markups over the last 25 years might have reduced EU GDP by five to seven percent.\n\nThese key findings are discussed in more depth below.\n\nEvolution of competition\n\nThe report asserts that on average and in a wide range of sectors in the last 25 years:\n\nDrivers of evolution of indicators of competition\n\nAs changes to competition have been across many sectors of the economy, the EC suggests that the changes have occurred due to both structural and institutional drivers.\n\nStructural drivers. Structural drivers include rising investments in proprietary IT solutions and data, other intangible investments, globalisation, and changes to business conduct (i.e., M&A, oligopolistic pricing and behaviour, exclusionary strategies and common ownership by shareholders). In particular, the EC observes a link between access to intangible assets such as software and indicators of weakened competition.\n\n'Winner takes most' dynamics mean that large first-mover firms have been able to reap most of the benefits. The EC considers that this winner-takes-most framework initially enhances productivity growth. However in a second stage, it inhibits the process. That is, trends show that once a firm has established dominance through initial structural efficiencies, it then becomes easier to engage in exclusionary conduct, leading to high barriers for new entrants. During the EC's conference on the study on 27 June, Professor Nancy Rose at MIT Economics described this two-phase exclusionary behaviour as 'getting to the top and then pulling up the ladder behind you'.\n\nWhilst the rise in M&A and potential underenforcement are flagged by the EC, it doesn't attribute these to reduced competition.\n\nInstitutional drivers. Institutionally, the report observes regulatory barriers to entry and expansion contributing to these 'winner takes most' dynamics. In this respect, more vigorous competition enforcement in the EU as an institutional driver is attributed to less adverse effects than in the United States.\n\nRecent shocks to the EU economy are mentioned in the report, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia-Ukraine war, and rising inflation in the context of whether the EU competitive process is resilient and flexible enough to adapt to similar shocks in the future. However, no concrete conclusions are made.\n\nSpecific sectors of focus\n\nAcross 127 sectors, the report presents a scorecard of competition levels according to each sector's performance against the indicators of competition identified (i.e., concentration, mark-ups, profits, and measures of business dynamism). Having ranked each sector's degree of competition (according to the indicators), the report concludes that regulatory intervention has been most frequent in sectors with high competition risks based on the sectoral scorecard. Highest ranking on the scorecard include gas, telecoms, pharmaceuticals, rail transport, beverages, cement, and aerospace.\n\nAccording to the report, technological change and globalisation have had benign competitive effects on unconcentrated sectors or sectors where technological and business process innovations improve competition (for example, retail, car manufacturing and the manufacturing of semiconductors). At the other end of the spectrum, technological change and globalisation have, according to the report, led to a widening of the gap between leading firms and followers. Limited churn/dynamism at the top have been more detrimental to consumers in sectors such as consumer goods for household and personal care products, breakfast cereals, carbonated soft drinks, tobacco or beer, or in business-to-business sectors such as aircraft manufacturing, cement, and pesticides and seeds, according to the report. The report posits that sectors such as software and pharmaceuticals exhibit both benign and adverse consequences of such structural drivers, with technical progress simultaneously benefiting consumers but increasing barriers to entry.\n\nSeveral sector-based nuances bear mention:\n\nWhilst the EC has observed variances by sector, it has taken the view that intensity of competition in the EU is now weaker overall.\n\nImpacts on macro-economic trends\n\nThe Commission also considers effects on worrying macro-economic trends such as reductions in productivity growth, wage inequality, lower investments, and overall lower economic growth.\n\nMore effective competition resulting in lower markups, could have macroeconomic benefits in the reduction in price levels, increased household consumption and private investment, a strengthening of productivity and overall economic growth, according to the report.\n\nThe report estimates the weakening of competition since 2000 may have led to a five to seven percent drop in GDP, a four to five percent increase in prices and a one to three percent drop in productivity, with a potential worsened outcome by 25 percent were it not for EC interventions in the last 10 years. The report also estimates that implementing measures to limit market power of dominant firms may increase GDP by two to four percent.\n\nWhy competition matters for economic outcomes\n\nThe report posits links among competition, the competitiveness of companies and macro-economic trends, such that weakened competition harms productivity and long-term economic outcomes. The report also states that firms experiencing strong competition at a domestic level perform better globally, based on studies of successful export sectors. That is, domestic competition incentivises improvements to product quality, efficiency, and innovation.\n\nKey observations of the report's authors\n\nWe note the following key conclusions and messages in the Commission's report:\n\nSimilar findings, particularly in relation to increased concentration and its links to mark ups and profits, have been made in the United States, both by the Council of Economic Advisors in 2016 in their report 'Benefits of competition and indicators of market power' and the Chairperson of the Federal Trade Commission in 2018 in its contribution to the Quarterly Journal of Economics 'The rise of market power and the macroeconomic implications'. The 2016 report has since been cited by the Federal Trade Commission and the White House, including in the release of more stringent merger guidelines in July 2023.\n\nThe Competition and Markets Authority in the UK drew similar conclusions in its 2022 'state of UK competition' report, finding that the largest and most profitable firms are able to sustain their market position for longer than prior to the global financial crisis. This report notably conducted a more detailed analysis into common ownership and its effect on market concentration, and is similarly focused on end-consumer outcomes.",

He'd have a deal between the two warring nations wrapped up in a day, he said.\n\nTrump has also claimed that the billions of dollars in aid going to Ukraine was doing little good, adding that Kyiv is \"not winning the war.\"\n\nZelensky took umbrage with Trump's comments that Kyiv is losing, rejecting the term \"deadlock\" that Trump used to describe the conflict.\n\n\"It's not a deadlock, it's a problematic situation,\" Zelensky said. \"A deadlock means there's no way out.

The letter argues that Ukrainian NATO membership \"would reduce the security of the United States and NATO Allies, at considerable risk to all.\" The letter also calls into doubt whether Ukrainian NATO membership would deter a future conflict.\n\nThe letter argues that NATO expansion and the desire of many to incorporate Ukraine into NATO were the primary motivations for Russia's invasion. The letter claims that the sooner Ukrainian NATO membership is taken off the table, the sooner peace can be established.\n\nThe letter deprecates emotive arguments for Ukrainian NATO membership: \"The purpose of NATO is not to signal esteem for other countries; it is to defend NATO territory and strengthen the security of NATO members.\"\n\nThe letter included signatories from across the political spectrum, including the former Senator Jim Webb (D-VA), the international relations theorist John Measheimer, the foreign affairs expert John C. Hulsman, and William Ruger, president of the American Institute for Economic Research. Sumantra Maitra, a senior editor at The American Conservative, was also a signatory.",

We will not allow this,\" Scholz said.\n\nLast month, the Russian president named several conditions before peace talks with Ukraine could begin. Moscow would order a ceasefire the moment Kiev withdraws troops from the territory of all four regions that voted to join Russia and officially announces it no longer wishes to join NATO, he said.\n\nThe lifting of all Western sanctions and the \"demilitarization and denazification\" of the Ukrainian government would also have to happen before a peace could be concluded.\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban had proposed a \"quick ceasefire\" to Vladimir Zelensky on his visit to Kiev earlier this week, but said the Ukrainian leader \"didn't like it very much.\"\n\nScholz was also asked to guarantee that Germany would not become a party to the war. Berlin has been the biggest EU donor to the Ukrainian cause, while insisting that this did not make Germany a participant in the hostilities.\n\n\"Yes, I give this guarantee,\" Scholz said. \"As chancellor, I stand by that.\"\n\nGermany's ruling 'traffic light' coalition has been rattled by a poor showing in last month's European Parliament election, leading to speculation that Scholz might have to resign in the near future. The chancellor admitted that \"many people do not agree with the support for Ukraine and the sanctions against Russia,\" but refused to change his policy.",

        "body": "PETALING JAYA: Crude palm oil (CPO) is expected to regain its pricing competitiveness in the second half of 2024 (2H24) given tighter supplies and gradual return in demand resulting in higher prices.\n\nThis would be supported by lower production due to unfavourable weather conditions in 2H23 and 1Q24, along with recovering demand, as palm oil inventories in major importing countries like India and China had been trending downwards.\n\nUOB Kay Hian (UOBKH) Research, in its 2H24 outlook report, said it has maintained the CPO price forecast for 2024 at RM4,200 per tonne.\n\nYear-to-date, the CPO price averaging at RM4,029 per tonne is still within expectation, it added.\n\nAdditionally, short-term weather disruptions are affecting other crops, leading to lower production and shipment delays due to Red Sea tensions.\n\n\"This may continue to support CPO prices at the current level, trading in the range of RM3,800 to RM4,500 per tonne,\" added UOBKH Research.\n\nOther events to watch out for include the swing from El Nino to La Nina weather in the same year as well as record soybean harvests year after year.\n\nAlso, the macroeconomic uncertainties continue to persist, including the pace of China's economic recovery, potential slowdown in the United States, escalating tensions in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the impact on freight rates.\n\nMeanwhile, based on planters' latest 1Q24 earnings announcements, most of them reported a weaker quarter-on-quarter earnings growth mainly due to lower CPO production and sales volume, despite an improvement in CPO average selling prices (ASP).\n\nUOBKH Research noted operating margin improved significantly from 13.8% in December 23 to 17.2% in 1Q24, thanks to lower production costs and stable CPO ASP.\n\n\"We expect sector earnings growth to remain robust at 49% y-o-y in 2024.\n\n\"This projection is underpinned by the expected expansion of margins, driven by reduced production costs (especially fertiliser prices), yield recovery and our internal forecast of a higher CPO price of RM4,200 per tonne for 2024,\" it added.\n\nOn top of that, UOBKH Research has also observed higher pricing for byproducts such as palm kernel oil and palm stearin, which have improved by 23.5% and 9.4% year-to-date, respectively.\n\nIn the past two years, many plantation players have become net cash companies due to strong cash flow from high CPO prices and low capital expenditure, the brokerage firm pointed out.\n\n\"This financial strength has allowed them to raise dividend yields through higher payout ratios.\n\n\"Given their strong cash positions, plantation companies are expected to continue offering relatively high dividend yields, reflecting their financial stability and commitment to shareholder returns,\"the research house noted.\n\nUOBKH Research also said plantation companies have been providing strong dividend yields of 5% to 10% in recent years, supported by strong cash flows resulting from higher CPO prices.\n\nHence, the brokerage firm has maintained an overweight on the sector as \"we foresee the elevated CPO prices continuing to support earnings and good dividend payout.\"\n\nWhile the steady earnings growth may not be as attractive relative to the thematic theme now, UOBKH Research noted this sector could be a good investment for investors looking for steady capital appreciation as CPO prices may be supported by limited production growth going forward and good dividend yield.\n\nIts top picks within the sector are IOI Corp Bhd with a target price (TP) of RM4.80 and Hap Seng Plantations Holdings Bhd (TP: RM2.25).\n\nHap Seng Plantations will benefit the most as the group only sells in the spot market and enjoys better CPO ASP, accordijng to the research house.\n\nAs one of the most cost-efficient plantation companies, Hap Seng Plantation's earnings before income tax margin was 31% in 1Q24, compared with the peer average of 17%.\n\nIOI Corp, meanwhile, has the highest exposure to Malaysia, as well as higher refining margins compared with other big-cap plantation companies.\n\n\"Its valuation is also cheaper at about 15 times compared with other big-cap plantation players which are trading at 20 times to 25 times,\" UOBKH Research added.",

The occupiers struck the village of Ruska Lozova in the Kharkiv region with guided aerial bombs: two civilians were injured, one of them in serious condition.\n\nIn Poltava region, one person was killed in a Russian strike.\n\nNear Toretsk, the occupiers attacked an evacuation vehicle: two paramedics were injured.\n\nCiting two national security experts associated with US presidential candidate Donald Trump's entourage, Politico writes that the politician is considering talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin on \"NATO non-expansion\" and how much of the seized territory of Ukraine the Kremlin can keep.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that if Trump has a plan to end the Russian-Ukrainian war, he should share it. However, he warned that any proposal should not violate Ukraine's sovereignty.\n\nThe head of the Presidential Office, Andriy Yermak, also emphasized that Ukraine is not ready to give up its territories, but is ready to listen to advice on establishing a \"just peace\".\n\nOn the night of July 1, officers of the Defence Intelligence of Ukraine and the Foreign Intelligence Service attacked the Oskol Ugarov Electrometallurgical Plant in the Belgorod region. This is the only full-cycle metallurgical enterprise in Russia.\n\nAfter the attack, all electric arc furnaces at the plant stopped, as the metal froze.\n\nNATO members have agreed on annual funding of 40 billion euros for Ukraine, Reuters reports, citing an unnamed European diplomat.\n\nNATO leaders are expected to sign the pledge at a summit in Washington on July 9-11.\n\nUkraine has received a $2.2 billion tranche from the International Monetary Fund. The transferred amount should help the Ukrainian government finance critical budget expenditures, social benefits, and salaries for doctors and teachers.\n\nIn a veterinary clinic, a man cursed at doctor Oleksii Prytula, a veteran of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, when he apparently saw that he was wearing prostheses. The visitor wanted the vet to come to his dog.\n\nLater, a video of the man apologizing appeared online. He says he did not see that the vet was wearing prostheses. The doctor said he did not accept the apology.\n\nOn July 3, the Kyiv Court of Appeal left MP Mykola Tyshchenko under house arrest. The politician tried to appeal against the preventive measure imposed on him on June 25 after a conflict with a former military officer in Dnipro.\n\nThe lawyers said that there were not enough MPs in the parliament, to which the judge replied: \"There are also not enough judges, but we are working somehow.\"\n\nBloomberg, citing European officials, writes that Chinese and Russian companies are developing a drone analogous to Iran's Shahed attack drone. This indicates that Beijing is preparing to transfer lethal weapons to Moscow, as Western officials have previously warned, the journalists say.",

        "title": "Israel's war with Iran on seven fronts",
        "body": "Senior Writer, Foreign Policy & Deputy Editor, National Security and Foreign Policy\n\nWith Israel still engulfed in war in the Gaza Strip and openly considering a new offensive in southern Lebanon, concerns are mounting across the region over the prospect of an even larger conflict erupting that could see at least seven major fronts of fighting.\n\nAlready, Israel has faced strikes from multiple theaters since the Palestinian Hamas movement conducted an unprecedented surprise attack last October. Last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke of his nation being engaged in a \"seven-front war\" with Iran, saying it supports an informal coalition of regionwide factions known as the \"Axis of Resistance.\"\n\nThe following day, the Iranian Mission to the United Nations shared with Newsweek and published to X, formerly Twitter, a stark warning against any Israeli \"full-scale military aggression\" in Lebanon, home to the powerful Hezbollah movement that has been engaged with Israel in tit-for-tat cross-border attacks.\n\nSuch a move, the Iranian Mission warned, would lead to an \"obliterating war\" and, potentially, \"the involvement of all Resistance Fronts.\"\n\nIn response, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told Newsweek that \"the IDF is prepared for a variety of security scenarios in all areas, and will continue to protect the State of Israel from the various threats.\"\n\nNow, with threats only escalating and no imminent signs of ceasefire in Gaza or the Israel-Lebanon border, Newsweek has outlined the seven fronts in which Israel has already faced strikes and where further escalations could manifest in the event of a larger-scale conflict breaking out.\n\nThe Gaza Strip\n\nIsrael and Hamas have engaged in several conflicts and flare-ups since the Islamist Palestinian group took control of Gaza in 2007, two years after the IDF disengaged from a territory they occupied for decades and just one year after Hamas emerged victorious in Palestinian elections, sparking a violent rift with the traditionally dominant left-wing Fatah party. The deadly October 7, 2023, attack led by Hamas and the ensuing IDF offensive, however, has sparked the longest and deadliest war to date in the densely populated coastal territory.\n\nWhile Israeli officials have claimed major gains in the conflict, they have also acknowledged that achieving their stated goals of defeating Hamas as a functioning military and political entity, ensuring Gaza could not present a threat in the future and returning hostages still held in enemy territory could still take months. Hamas, meanwhile, has managed to continue to conduct near-daily operations, often in partnership with a diverse range of smaller factions.\n\nThe West Bank\n\nWhile the Fatah-led Palestinian National Authority (PA) retains nominal control over parts of the West Bank, President Mahmoud Abbas faces a major legitimacy crisis over popular resentment toward a lack of elections, accusations of corruption and growing Israeli military and settler activity that have eroded the PA's governing functions. The IDF has regularly conducted raids against suspected militia strongholds such as the Jenin refugee camp, while Hamas and other factions, including independent groups, have expanded their influence across the West Bank, including the disputed holy city of Jerusalem.\n\nWhile weapons smuggling into Gaza has long been an area of concern for Israel, the current war has drawn attention to the vast number of arms spread throughout the West Bank. Israel already exerts effective control over much of the territory, but a concerted offensive by groups here could further divert Israeli security resources otherwise needed to respond to other fronts.\n\nLebanon\n\nIsrael has already begun to double down on resources allocated to the northern front as a result of intensifying clashes with Hezbollah, which recently told Newsweek it was \"ready for anything.\" Israel has invaded Lebanon three times in the past and fought two major wars involving Hezbollah, but observers have warned that a new all-out conflict could be the most devastating yet for both sides.\n\nIsraeli officials have told Newsweek they estimate that Hezbollah has accumulated an arsenal of around 200,000 rockets, as well as mortars, drones, surface-to-air missiles, anti-tank missiles, precision-guided munitions, among other armaments. Widely considered to be larger and far more powerful than Hamas, a battle with Hezbollah could see major Israeli cities such as Tel Aviv and Haifa targeted with barrages of weaponry in a bid to overwhelm Israeli defense systems, such as the Iron Dome, in addition to Israeli troops facing constant fire on both sides of the border.\n\nSyria\n\nIsrael also shares a northern de facto border with Syria in the Golan Heights, much of which has been occupied and annexed by Israel without international recognition. Iran has expanded its influence across Syria since sending advisers and backing Hezbollah and a number of other militias in support of President Bashar al-Assad who has been embroiled in civil war against various rebel and jihadi groups since 2011, throughout which the IDF has conducted hundreds of airstrikes against suspected Iran-linked targets.\n\nSince the outbreak of the war in Gaza, Israeli officials have told Newsweek that a powerful coalition of such groups with close ties to Iran and Hezbollah known as the \"Imam Hossein Division\" have operated in both Syria and neighboring Lebanon. Launches against Israel have occurred occasionally, but an IDF airstrike that killed Iranian military officials at Tehran's consular building in Damascus sparked the first-ever direct exchange of attacks between Iran and Israel, exacerbating worries that the ongoing crisis in the Middle East could lead to an all-out battle between the two longtime rivals.\n\nIraq\n\nA number of the militias active in Syria hail from Iraq, which has emerged as a particularly active front since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war. While not directly bordering Israel, Iraq has been the source of frequent drone and missile attacks claimed by a coalition of factions known as the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, which includes prominent groups such as the Nujaba Movement, Kataib Hezbollah, Ashab al-Kahf and others.\n\nUntil February, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq also claimed frequent attacks on U.S. troops in Iraq and neighboring Syria, but the deaths of three U.S. soldiers at the Jordan-Syria border saw a comprehensive set of U.S. strikes against militia positions in Iraq and Syria and a pause to the campaign. These groups have warned, however, that their halt was tied to promises of a U.S. withdrawal from Iraq, something the Pentagon has signaled no plans to carry out, and Iraqi militia leaders have repeatedly threatened to not only resume but expand their campaign against U.S. forces as strikes against Israel continue.\n\nYemen\n\nLocated even further away from Israel, Yemen's Ansar Allah, or Houthi movement, has established itself as one of the most disruptive \"Axis of Resistance\" factions of the ongoing war. The group, which has held the capital Sanaa since 2015 in defiance of a Saudi-led coalition supporting the country's internationally recognized government, has launched missiles and drones against Israel, sometimes in joint operations with the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, as well as against commercial vessels across the region accused of violating the militia-imposed blockade of trade with Israel.\n\nAnsar Allah has also faced repeated strikes from the U.S. and the United Kingdom as a result of its maritime offensive. But the group has sought to fortify its military infrastructure with a system of underground complexes and has vowed to enter into direct war with both Israel and the U.S. if necessary.\n\nIran\n\nLike the U.S., Iran has repeatedly stated that it did not seek a regional war, and Iranian officials have told Newsweek that, even in the event of an Israeli war in Lebanon, they believed Hezbollah had sufficient strength to defeat their mutual foe. But the Islamic Republic's language has notably sharpened in recent months as the prospect of an Israel-Hezbollah war increasingly came into focus and Iranian officials have readily advertised their direct support for \"Axis of Resistance\" factions.\n\nIran possesses the largest and most advanced missile arsenal in the Middle East, only a fraction of which was put on display during the April barrage against Israel. While Israel has long displayed the ability to strike the Islamic Republic from within, an open war could test Israel, nearby Arab states and the U.S. like never before.\n\nOther Potential Fronts\n\nThe \"Axis of Resistance\" touts largely Shiite Muslim fighters from across the Middle East and beyond, to include units made up of primarily Afghan and Pakistani fighters. Both Taliban-led Afghanistan and neighboring Pakistan have issued warnings against Israel over its offensive in Gaza but neither nation has displayed any willingness to get directly involved in the conflict and both governments also have their own complex histories with Iran and its allies.\n\nStill, the Iran-aligned coalition has sought to further broaden its horizons to include contingents from other countries such as Jordan and Bahrain, both close U.S. partners that have sought to crackdown on domestic activity suspected to have ties to Iran. Azerbaijan, a close Israeli partner that also borders Iran, has also contended with pro-Iran elements at home.\n\nAlso complicating the regional landscape has been a growing partnership between Iran and Russia, which has utilized Iranian drones in its ongoing war in Ukraine. Russia has traditionally sought to balance its relationships with Iran and Israel but has emerged as an increasingly vocal critic of Israel's campaign in Gaza and its airstrikes in Syria, where Moscow maintains troops and air defense systems.",

        "title": "Georgia's double game: European integration and Chinese investments",
        "body": "Over the past year, Georgia has achieved candidate status for EU membership and signed a strategic partnership agreement with China. Experts fear that these two paths are incompatible.\n\nGeorgia-China relations\n\nGeorgia has decided to grant the Chinese consortium [CCCC] the right to construct the deep-water port of Anaklia on the Black Sea, a port of strategic importance to Georgia. Only this consortium participated in the government-announced tender.\n\n\"Currently, legal and commercial assessments are underway for the proposal submitted by the bidder, after which the winner will be announced,\" a representative from the Ministry of Economy told JAMnews.\n\nThe China-Singapore Holding Company [CCCC] has been sanctioned by the US due to questionable activities related to its operations in the South China Sea. Additionally, the company is on the blacklist of the World Bank, Asian, and African Development Banks for engaging in corrupt practices. While the Georgian government sees the deal with this company as an \"economic relief\" for the country, Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili described this choice as a \"stab\" to American and European partners.\n\nShortly before the deal with the Chinese, the Georgian Parliament passed a controversial \"foreign agents\" law, seen by strategic partners as a shift in the country's geopolitical course. Some experts suggest a linkage between handing over a key infrastructure asset to China and effectively abandoning the European integration process.\n\nRelations between Georgia and China have intensified, especially since Georgia obtained candidate status for EU membership. Following the signing of a strategic partnership document, China introduced visa-free travel for Georgian citizens, and Georgian prime minister Irakli Kobakhidze highlighted a multifaceted deepening of relations between the two countries, with pro-Chinese messages increasing on government channels.\n\nMoreover, Georgia received candidate status conditional on meeting 9 recommendations, including a new one to align its overall foreign and security policy with that of the European Union.\n\nExperts speculate that this recommendation was added precisely due to the intensification of Georgian-Chinese relations, as the EU views China as a threat and has \"doubts about Georgia's sincerity in Euro-integration.\"\n\nGeorgia-China relations\n\nIvane Chkhikvadze, a researcher at the Open Society Georgia Foundation, believes that the rapid rapprochement between China and Georgia is incompatible with European integration, and Georgia will have to choose between these two integration processes.\n\nAccording to Chkhikvadze, the above-mentioned EU recommendation is due to two reasons:\n\n\"First of all, it's the strategic cooperation agreement signed by Georgia with China, which, according to the EU's security concept, poses a threat to European integration. The second reason is that Georgia has resumed air traffic with Russia. These two factors have raised serious questions within the EU about how sincerely Georgia is interested in European integration.\"\n\nChkhikvadze believes that by implementing large infrastructure projects (in Greece, Albania, and now in Georgia), China is trying to create a unified belt that will somewhat compete with the European Union. The Georgian government, on the other hand, thinks that transferring key infrastructure projects to China will help Georgia fulfill its historical transit function and bring it even closer to the EU.\n\nBut, according to Chkhikvadze, when it comes to European integration, \"the main thing is to fulfill the 9 recommendations, and there is no need to look for other formats beyond this, no need to reinvent the wheel.\"\n\nAnother problematic aspect is China's lack of a clear position on the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\n\"This war has left no more gray areas in international relations. It's impossible for a country to remain neutral; it needs to either be against the aggression or side with Russia,\" says Ivane Chkhikvadze.\n\nHe believes that the Georgian government will not be able to maintain the fragile balance between European integration and rapprochement with China:\n\n\"Armenia is a good example of how balancing policies don't work. It tried to stay in Russia's orbit in terms of security while signing a partnership agreement with the European Union, and we all saw the result.\"\n\nExperts estimate that China's economic power has become its political tool. Rapid economic growth has made the country a major player in international trade and investment. Currently, China's economy is the second largest in the world (GDP $14 trillion), and the country is the largest global exporter of goods. Thanks to investments in infrastructure projects and strategic sectors, China's geopolitical influence is also growing.\n\n\"In general, Chinese policy is not rigid or aggressive, like Russia's, for example. On the contrary, it is quiet and covert,\" says sinologist Teona Gelashvili.\n\nTeona studied Chinese language and literature at Tbilisi State University, won a Chinese government scholarship, and went to China on a special study program. After completing the program, she decided to continue her studies at the Beijing International University in the Faculty of Sinology.\n\n\"These were international relations from an Asian perspective. Both Chinese and European professors taught. There I understood the peculiarities of how the Chinese view their country and the world from a political perspective.\"\n\nTeona believes that establishing strategic relations with China requires a detailed understanding of the country's politics and culture. Her interactions with Chinese people and companies convinced her of the importance of maintaining a principled position. According to Teona, it is very important what position the Georgian government takes now:\n\n\"It's important to understand that if one country is interested in another and invests a lot of resources, it wants to gain political influence over it.\n\nYou always need to be principled. If you show weakness, it will be exploited and used against you. It's necessary to have firm positions.\"\n\nGeorgia-China relations\n\nInternational relations expert Tornike Sharashenidze sees no risks at this stage in the intensification of economic relations between Georgia and China:\n\n\"Georgia is a poor country and it needs Chinese investments. If someone thinks we shouldn't have economic interests, that's just foolishness. Every country tries to have allies and partners everywhere. The more allies you have, the better it is for you.\"\n\nSharashenidze believes that, unlike the European Union, Georgia cannot afford to forgo Chinese investments. He welcomes China's investments in the Anaklia port if the state retains a controlling stake:\n\n\"Every small country has to consider the international context. When the world was unipolar in the 1990s and 2000s and America was the strongest state, Georgia fully aligned with the US. Now, with China as the second strongest player, Georgia takes this reality into account at some level. Moreover, Russia cannot openly oppose China. We can view cooperation with China as a counterbalance to Russia's influence in the region.\"\n\nAccording to recent data, China is Georgia's fourth-largest trading partner. Over the last decade, trade turnover between the two countries has tripled. The main sectors of cooperation between Georgia and China are transportation, energy, and tourism.\n\nSpecifically, the trade volume last year approached $2 billion, a significant increase compared to the $1.1 billion in 2019. In the first quarter of 2023, Georgia received almost $20 million in Chinese investments.\n\nGeorgia became the first country in the region to sign a free trade agreement with China.\n\nGeorgia established a visa-free regime for Chinese citizens in September 2023. On February 26, 2024, it was announced that the People's Republic of China would lift the visa regime for Georgian citizens. The visa-free regime took effect on April 10.\n\nThe agreement signed between the countries includes political, economic, international, and intercultural dimensions. Both sides agree that, alongside the intensification of trade, deepening bilateral relations is a priority in foreign relations. They announced the enhancement of political consultations between legislative and executive bodies and political parties. Georgia welcomes China's \"Belt and Road\" initiative, as well as initiatives for global development, civilization, and security, and is convinced that \"China offers humanity a new path and choice for achieving modernization.\"\n\nHowever, according to Georgia's foreign minister, \"the strategic partnership with China does not imply a change in the country's foreign policy course.\"",

        "summary": "Over the past year, Georgia has pursued both European integration and Chinese investments, raising concerns about the compatibility of these paths. Georgia granted the Chinese consortium CCCC the right to construct the strategic Anaklia deep-water port on the Black Sea, despite CCCC being sanctioned by the US and blacklisted by several international banks for corrupt practices. Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili criticized this move as a betrayal to Western allies.\n\nThe Georgian Parliament also passed a controversial \"foreign agents\" law, seen as a shift away from European integration. Experts suggest that Georgia's deepening ties with China, including a strategic partnership agreement and visa-free travel, conflict with its EU candidate status, which requires alignment with EU foreign and security policies.\n\nResearcher Ivane Chkhikvadze argues that Georgia must choose between European integration and closer ties with China, noting that the EU added a recommendation for Georgia to align its policies with the EU due to concerns over its relations with China and resumed air traffic with Russia. Chkhikvadze warns that balancing these relationships is unsustainable, citing Armenia's failed attempt to balance ties with Russia and the EU.\n\nChina's growing economic influence, through investments in infrastructure and strategic sectors, is seen as a political tool. Sinologist Teona Gelashvili emphasizes the need for Georgia to maintain a principled stance in its dealings with China to avoid exploitation.\n\nInternational relations expert Tornike Sharashenidze sees no immediate risks in Georgia's economic relations with China, arguing that the country needs Chinese investments and can use them to counterbalance Russian influence. China is Georgia's fourth-largest trading partner, with significant growth in trade and investments over the past decade. The two countries have signed a free trade agreement and established a visa-free regime, with plans to enhance political and economic cooperation.\n\nDespite these developments, Georgia's foreign minister insists that the strategic partnership with China does not signal a shift in the country's foreign policy."

        "title": "Starmer, Sunak make final UK election push",
        "body": "In a final push before Election Day, Labour chief Keir Starmer and Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak spent Wednesday issuing dire economic warnings about their opponent's potential victory, as they concluded their national campaign efforts.\n\nAccording to opinion polls, Starmer's Labour Party is poised for a landslide victory in the election on Thursday, potentially ending the Conservative government's 14-year reign and ushering the center-left leader into the prime minister's office at 10 Downing Street.\n\nLabour strategists, concerned about potential voter complacency or protest votes, issued a final appeal as polling stations prepared to open. In a statement, the party's campaign coordinator Pat McFadden sought to remind the electorate of recent economic turmoil.\n\n\"Don't forget the economic chaos for which the British people are still paying the price,\" he said.\n\n\"If you vote Conservative, nothing will change. If you don't vote at all or vote for another party, you run the risk of waking up on Friday to Rishi Sunak walking through the door to No 10 once again.\"\n\nStarmer has centered his campaign on a singular promise of \"change\", resonating with a public frustrated by the UK's current state of affairs, Reuters reported. His message addresses concerns over struggling public services and falling living standards, which are attributed to a sluggish economy and political instability.\n\nDuring his 20-month tenure as prime minister, Sunak has sought to convince the electorate that he has steered the economy onto a path of recovery.\n\nHe argues that his leadership has effectively navigated the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effect of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, while also bringing stability after years of turbulence under previous Conservative administrations.\n\nSunak claims that implementing Starmer's proposed reforms would necessitate tax increases.\n\nSpecter of tax hikes\n\nUnable to reduce Labour's substantial lead of approximately 20 points in opinion polls, the Conservatives have shifted their strategy from pursuing outright victory to damage control, aiming to reduce the margin of their potential loss.\n\nIn the closing stages of their campaign, the Conservatives have cautioned that a decisive Labour victory would embolden Starmer to implement tax hikes beyond those already disclosed.\n\n\"The larger the scale of the supermajority, the easier it will be to ram through extreme policies -- and the more tax rises will be inflicted on the British people,\"\n\nthe Conservatives said in a statement.\n\nOn Tuesday, former prime minister Boris Johnson made a surprise appearance at a rally event to bolster support for the Conservative Party and Sunak.\n\nJohnson argued that voting for Labour or backing right-wing party Reform on Thursday would \"achieve nothing but usher in the most left-wing government since (World War II)\".\n\nSky News reported an average of all polls completed in the week up to Tuesday puts Labour on 40 percent, ahead of the Conservatives' 21 percent, followed by Reform on 16 percent, the Liberal Democrats on 11 percent and the Greens on 6 percent.\n\nWriting in the Daily Telegraph newspaper on Wednesday, former home secretary Suella Braverman said victory should no longer be the ambition for the Conservatives.\n\nBraverman told Conservative supporters to prepare for losing the election.\n\n\"Thursday's vote is now all about forming a strong enough opposition. One needs to read the writing on the wall: it's over, and we need to prepare for the reality and frustration of opposition,\" she said.\n\nSpeaking to Times Radio, Cabinet minister Mel Stride said, \"Unless it's an extraordinary upset, which is highly unlikely, you're going to get a Labour government, you're going to get the change.\"",

I am grateful for his frank dialogue and his answers,\" Orban said.\n\nZelensky told reporters his priority was to see \"Europe's support for Ukraine maintained at sufficient level\" and that it was \"important for cooperation between all the neighbors in Europe to become more meaningful and mutually beneficial\".\n\nHe later wrote on X that Orban's visit was a \"clear signal to all of us of the importance of unity in Europe and taking collective steps\" and added that he and Orban had \"discussed the path to a just, lasting, and fair peace\".\n\nHowever, a government spokesperson of Ukraine later said the nation does not favor a cease-fire but would prefer to find a lasting peace through an international peace summit.\n\nIn his role as president of the European Council, Orban will have a lot of influence in the coming months. In the past, he has sometimes been out of step with other national leaders in the 27-nation bloc, especially around the issue of Ukraine, and he previously slowed the progress of a 50-billion-euro ($54-billion) EU aid package for Kyiv.\n\nDuring their meeting, Orban and Zelensky also discussed ways the nations could work together in the infrastructure and energy sectors, cross-border collaboration, and bilateral trade.\n\nThe BBC said they also spoke about Ukraine's large population of ethnic Hungarians.\n\nOrban, who was making his first visit to Ukraine for 12 years, also said the nations may sign a bilateral agreement to regulate ties.\n\n\"We would like to make the relationship between the two countries better,\" Orban said. \"We would like to make a broad bilateral agreement with Ukraine, similar to the ones we already made with our neighbors. We would be happy to take part in the modernization of Ukraine's economy, we would like an ordered framework for this.\"",

The news agency's account did not explain why the Kremlin was opposed to Erdogan's participation.\n\nThe Turkish presidency said the two leaders also discussed the war in Gaza and ways to end the conflict in Syria.\n\nTurkey is a member of NATO, the U.S.-led Western military alliance.\n\nUnlike other NATO leaders, who have imposed sanctions on Putin's government, Erdogan has tried to maintain good relations with both Russia and Ukraine throughout the conflict.\n\nTurkey played a key role in putting in place a deal to ensure grain could be shipped safely from Ukraine's Black Sea ports. The accord remained in effect for a year.\n\n(Reporting by Tuvan Gumrukcu and Huseyin Hayatsever; Editing by Peter Graff, Ron Popeski and Trevor Hunnicutt)",

        "title": "The idiot's guide to confiscating Russian assets",
        "body": "Know what moves the world. Stay informed with Kompreno. Get quality journalism from across Europe.\n\nRussia continues to destroy Ukraine, and the West and Ukraine are footing the bill. Meanwhile, the G7 countries have frozen $300 billion of Russian assets in their banks but cannot make the jump to seize them to help Ukraine's fight.\n\nWhy the holdup? Euromaidan Press explains in collaboration with the International Center for Ukrainian Victory.\n\nNot fully. First, we cannot fully calculate the extent of damage; second, human lives are priceless. After Ukraine's victory, much will remain to be done to bring Russia to justice. But right now, the G7 have frozen Russian assets in their countries, which can be fully used. However, even now, they are already less than the damages suffered by Ukraine, and the size of the damages is still growing.\n\nThe biggest slice of the pie is Russian state assets (reserves of the Russian Central Bank, Russia's central financial institution) - $300 billion. They've been frozen in banking institutions across the G7 countries.\n\nSo why are these assets parked there in the first place?\n\nWell, at the time of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia kept some assets in money and securities abroad in reliable banks, scooping up foreign currency.\n\nWe know for a fact that the lion's share of these assets, €192 billion to be precise, is held in Euroclear, a financial institution headquartered in Brussels that specializes in the safekeeping and settlement of securities.\n\nAs for the rest of the assets, their exact size and location are a bit of a mystery since that information is classified, but it's a safe bet that a hefty chunk is in the USA.\n\nThere are also Russian private assets floating around abroad, like yachts and businesses belonging to Russian oligarchs and propagandists.\n\nBut the total value of these is way smaller than the $300 billion in state assets, and confiscating them is a whole other can of worms. Each country has to make its own call on the matter, and then there's a court procedure to go through for each individual case, which is going to take a while.\n\nIt is also very difficult because the human rights of Russians owning them should be complied with, and the highest legal standards should be applied. That's why the spotlight is on the state assets, given Ukraine's urgent military and reconstruction needs. Confiscating these will be a quicker process.\n\nThis step falls under the category of countermeasures against an aggressor state that has launched an aggressive war and is violating international law left and right. Western countries have already frozen these funds based on this logic, but they haven't quite mustered up the resolve to fully confiscate them and hand them over to Ukraine.\n\nThere have been plenty of times throughout history when states have frozen the assets of other countries as a response to aggression:\n\nBut actually confiscating those assets and transferring them to the victim country? That's a lot rarer.\n\nHistorically, this has always been part of a post-war settlement, like the Treaty of Versailles after World War I or Germany's and Japan's World War II reparations. Directly confiscating frozen assets and handing them over to the victim country while the conflict is still ongoing? That's uncharted territory.\n\nIf the proposed use of frozen Russian assets for Ukraine's reconstruction actually happens, it would be a pretty big deal in this regard, but there are solid grounds for it.\n\nRussia stands accused of committing genocide in Ukraine and has caused mind-boggling damage to its infrastructure.\n\nThe reconstruction bill already stands at a whopping $486 billion, according to the World Bank. The damage to Ukraine's power grid is especially severe, with Russian strikes destroying 70% of its generating capacity.\n\nUkraine does not insist that this money is simply given to Ukraine; rather, the plan is to make the funds work for Ukraine's defense, which is the top priority. There are a few ways this could play out:\n\nUkraine is pushing for the ability to buy domestically-produced weapons with these funds, which are less expensive than western-made ones. They're also beefing up their capacity to handle the funds by ramping up anti-corruption measures.\n\nBeyond defense, the Russian funds are likely to be used for reconstruction and compensation for victims, although the exact breakdown isn't clear yet.\n\nOne big step forward to the confiscation of these funds was the US passing the REPO (Russian Elites, Proxies, and Oligarchs) Act on 23 April 2024.\n\nWhile successfully implementing it depends on further actions and certifications, the REPO Act lays out a legal mechanism for asset confiscation, gives the President the power to start the confiscation process, and allows for coordination with G7 countries, the EU, and other partners. It could potentially give Ukraine access to an estimated $5-8 billion in Russian sovereign assets located in the US.\n\nHowever, the G7 did not follow the US's lead.\n\nInstead, on 3 May 2024, the Financial Times reported that the G7 was no longer considering a full confiscation of frozen Russian assets, with an official saying that these assets could be used as leverage in potential peace negotiations with Russia.\n\nThis stance fails to recognize Russia's true objectives and the pointlessness of using these assets as a bargaining chip, given Russia's continued escalation of aggression and substantial revenues from fossil fuel exports.\n\nSeveral initial steps have been taken to ensure that Russia's frozen funds are already benefiting Ukraine:\n\nThis loan would allow Ukraine to survive. However, it would not ensure that Russia is punished for its crimes against mankind, ensure Ukraine's victory, or compensate Ukraine for the massive damages Russia caused.\n\nWhile Ukraine is set to receive portions of the frozen Russian assets, the entire $300 billion would be a game-changer. To put this sum into perspective:\n\nThis funding would allow the West to shift from \"drip-feeding\" weapons to a more impactful \"shock and awe\" support strategy. It would ensure a stable supply of ammunition and weapons, addressing the kind of shortages that led to Russian gains in spring 2024 when US aid was delayed.\n\nEconomist Timothy Ash argues that for Ukraine to pose a serious challenge to Russia, Western aid needs to increase from $100 billion to $150 billion annually. He suggests that using the confiscated assets is:\n\nIn essence, this massive injection of funds could provide Ukraine with critical resources while easing the financial burden on Western taxpayers.\n\nWhat could Ukraine do with $300 billion in Russian assets?\n\nTo put this sum into perspective, let's look at the numbers:\n\nInterestingly, with these resources, Ukraine has managed to destroy Russian equipment worth an estimated $98.7 billion - nearly double the value of their own arsenal (check out how we made these estimates here).\n\nIf Ukraine were to receive the full $300 billion, it could potentially increase its military capacity by almost six times. Of course, this is a simplification, as factors like equipment availability also play a role.\n\nSo, what could Ukraine actually buy with this money? According to defense expert Ivan Kyrychevskyi, here's a potential shopping list:\n\nKyrychevskyi estimates this funding could provide Ukraine with a 5-year security cushion. However, he cautions that even with money available, acquiring weapons isn't always straightforward due to availability issues and rising prices.\n\nRussia has already been forcing sales of Western assets at knock-off prices, as well as imposing punitive taxes on Western enterprises for a while now, way before any talk of confiscating Russian assets started:\n\nReports show that Russia had also basically stolen assets from a bunch of other Western companies by handing them over to state-owned enterprises or Putin's buddies' businesses for super cheap:\n\nRussia did all this in violation of international investment law, so Western companies have every right to hit back. Plus, the longer Western companies stay in Russia, the more likely it is that their assets will get snatched up or sold for peanuts.\n\nSo playing nice with Russia on this issue probably won't do much to protect Western investments anyway.\n\nRussia will definitely try to challenge the confiscation of its assets in court, because it can. It will likely file lawsuits in various courts like the EU Court of Justice, the European Court of Human Rights, the International Court of Justice, and international investment arbitration tribunals.\n\nBut here's the thing - Russia's chances of actually winning these cases are really low.\n\nAt the end of the day, if asset confiscation measures are well-designed and clearly based on Russia's well-documented violations of fundamental international laws and norms, they will have a strong legal foundation to withstand Russia's legal challenges. Careful legal framing can make the measures even more bulletproof.\n\nSo while Russia will certainly use whatever legal options it has to fight back, its own blatant disregard for international law leaves it without a strong legal case.\n\nThe only courts where Russia is likely to win are Russian ones, and then the decision will apply to the territory of Russia. So, theoretically, Western companies that are still doing business in Russia can be affected, but as we've already seen, Putin's regime can confiscate their assets without any legal pretexts anyway, so it would be wiser for them to simply get out of Russia.\n\nSome worry that confiscating Russian assets might hurt the EU's economy. They think the euro could lose value if people start pulling their money out of banks.\n\nThere's a fear that other countries might get spooked, thinking their money isn't safe in EU banks anymore. This could cause financial trouble in the Eurozone. Big players like China, Saudi Arabia, and Indonesia have been lobbying against asset confiscation, worried about what it might mean for their own money.\n\nBut these fears might be blown out of proportion.\n\nHere's the thing: Russian assets are only on the chopping block because Russia invaded Ukraine. If you're not planning to invade anyone, you've got nothing to worry about. And if you are, perhaps you'll get second thoughts. Two birds with one stone.\n\nSome are particularly worried about China pulling its investments from Euroclear. But so far, China hasn't made any threats or official statements about doing this. And they haven't done anything like this in the past either.\n\nEconomist Timothy Ash points out that when the West froze Russian money two years ago, emerging economies did not react in any way.\n\nHe also says that even if countries like Saudi Arabia and China wanted to move their money elsewhere, there's really nowhere else to go. Western banks are still the safest and most reliable places to keep large amounts of money. The euro is still a superstar currency, used in countries with detailed banking laws and high standards to protect people's money.\n\nAsh adds that if a country did try to move its money, it would probably end up hurting itself more than anyone else. They could face sanctions from Western countries, see less economic growth, have less trade and investment, and even see oil and commodity prices drop. Countries like Saudi Arabia and China care a lot about keeping their economies stable, so they're unlikely to risk all that just to back up Russia.\n\nSo, while some people are worried, it's pretty unlikely that taking Russian assets would cause other countries to pull their money out of Western banks en masse. The potential downsides for countries trying to move their money, plus the lack of good alternatives to Western banks, make this scenario highly improbable.\n\nAt its core, the issue of confiscation comes down to political will.\n\nDespite the various reasons that are raised in discussions about confiscating Russian assets, the true answer is that Western countries still aren't fully convinced of Ukraine's eventual victory. As a result, they lack a clear strategy for ensuring Ukraine's success and Russia's defeat.\n\nThey want to maintain a window for future negotiations with Russia. They fear that asset confiscation will be perceived as a serious escalation and are reluctant to demonstrate strength. They are concerned about jeopardizing future business opportunities, hoping that the familiar world in which Russia was a business partner will eventually return.\n\nThe US Congress passing the REPO Act shows that asset confiscation is legally doable and can happen if the political will is there.\n\nDespite this big step forward, the G7 countries still haven't gathered the courage to do the same.\n\nRecent reports suggest that the G7 is backing off from fully confiscating frozen Russian assets, with some officials hinting that these assets could be used as a bargaining chip in potential peace talks with Russia. This attitude doesn't recognize the true nature of Russian aggression and the Kremlin's ultimate goal of replacing the rules-based order with a \"might makes right\" approach.\n\nUltimately, the West's hesitation to confiscate Russian assets comes from not being fully convinced that Ukraine will win in the end and not having a clear plan for making sure Ukraine succeeds and Russia loses.\n\nSome Western countries are still hoping to keep the door open for future negotiations with Russia, worried that taking their assets will be seen as a major escalation. They're also worried about losing out on future business opportunities, holding onto the hope that the familiar world where Russia was a business buddy will eventually come back.\n\nBut Russia's actions over the past two years have made it clear that it has no plans to return to the rules-based international order.\n\nIt's time for bold moves, and the G7 needs to find the courage to follow the US's lead in confiscating Russian assets. By doing this, they can show they're committed to Ukraine's victory, hold Russia accountable for its crimes, and make it crystal clear that aggression won't be tolerated in the 21st century.\n\nEverybody's support matters, and you can help! Raise your voice and tell your politicians, and especially G7 leaders, that the confiscation of Russian assets is a step towards justice, because Russia must pay for the crimes it has done. You could publish appeals to G7 leaders, tagging them, in social media requesting the confiscation of the funds. You could also contact your local politicians and ask them to ask the G7 leaders to give a green light to the confiscation of the funds.",

Thank you American taxpayers,\" read sticker text on a photo of an invoice shared in a July 1 Instagram post.\n\nThe invoice shown in the Instagram post is to \"Mrs. Olena Zelenska\" for a preorder of a Bugatti Tourbillon with a total price of nearly $4.5 million.\n\nThe Tourbillon is a new car by the luxury automaker that will cost more than $4 million and won't be delivered to customers until 2026.

This time, she said, Bugatti is making \"an exception because it is a false report.\"\n\nBugatti Paris, the official Bugatti partner in France, said in a statement posted July 1 on Instagram that the invoice was bogus and contained multiple errors, including the car's price, according to Meta's translation of the post.\n\nThe statement was from the Car Lovers Group, which owns Autofficina Parigi, the company that operates the Bugatti Paris dealership. The Car Lovers Group issued the same statement in a press release posted July 1 on its website. It said the company has filed a criminal complaint.\n\nThe statement referred to a video from a supposed Bugatti employee that was included in the Verite Cachee article and also shared separately in other social media posts.

The Center for Countering Disinformation also suggested it was generated with artificial intelligence.\n\nThe Verite Cachee website was created June 22 and many of the site's headlines are incomplete, with words such as \"Here is a short title for the article,\" according to a Google translation.\n\nOne article on the website about the Russia-Ukraine war appears to leave instructions on how to write the article with a pro-Russian slant.\n\n\"Here are some things to keep in mind for context. Republicans, Trump, DeSantis, and Russia are good, while Democrats, Biden, the war in Ukraine, big business, and pharma are bad. Feel free to add additional information on the topic as needed,\" the article's first paragraph said.\n\nThe Center for Countering Disinformation said \"Russian propagandists launched this fake before the NATO summit in order to discredit Ukraine's top leadership in the international arena.\" The NATO summit begins July 9 in Washington, D.C.\n\nAn Olena Zelenska Foundation spokesperson referred us to the X thread posted by the Center for Countering Disinformation.\n\nThe claim that Ukraine's first lady bought a $4 million sports car while visiting Paris with her husband is False.",

But a problem can be solved if one has the will and has the tools. We do have the will, and the tools - they haven't arrived yet.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian president also praised the $61 billion assistance package passed by Congress earlier this year -- but said it was taking too long to get the equipment to the front, the outlet said.\n\n\"This is the biggest tragedy of this war, that between the decision and real fact, we have a real long, long, long wait,\" Zelenskiy said.\n\nYesterday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the Pentagon will send Ukraine a military aid package worth $2.3 billion that will include \"more air defense interceptors, anti-tank weapons and other critical munitions from US inventories,\" Austin said.\n\nSome of that money will also pay for additional Patriot surface-to-air missile systems and National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems that are critical to defending Ukraine's airspace from Russian attacks, he said.\n\nThe Ukrainian president also rejected overtures from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who urged him to consider a cease-fire.\n\n\"Nobody has an answer,\" Zelenskiy said, adding that those saying he should accept an armistice haven't said how it would work.",

We will not allow this,\" Scholz said.\n\nLast month, the Russian president named several conditions before peace talks with Ukraine could begin. Moscow would order a ceasefire the moment Kiev withdraws troops from the territory of all four regions that voted to join Russia and officially announces it no longer wishes to join NATO, he said.\n\nScholz was also asked to guarantee that Germany would not become a party to the war. Berlin has been the biggest EU donor to the Ukrainian cause, while insisting that this did not make Germany a participant in the hostilities.\n\n\"Yes, I give this guarantee,\" Scholz said. \"As chancellor, I stand by that.\"\n\nGermany's ruling 'traffic light' coalition has been rattled by a poor showing in last month's European Parliament election, leading to speculation that Scholz might have to resign in the near future.

        "title": "Xi Jinping-Putin-led club adds ally to confront US - ExBulletin",
        "body": "A club of Eurasian countries led by China and Russia to advance their leaders' vision of an alternative world order is set to expand again this week -- this time by adding a staunch Russian ally that has openly supported Moscow's war in Ukraine.\n\nBelarus' expected admission to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) at its annual leaders' summit in Astana, Kazakhstan, is a new attempt by Beijing and Moscow to transform the group from a regional security bloc into a geopolitical counterweight to Western institutions led by the United States and its allies.\n\nBelarus, which helped Russia launch its invasion of Ukraine in 2022, will become the latest authoritarian state to join the club, after Iran became a full member last year.\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in Astana for the summit that began on Wednesday (3), their second meeting this year. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, leader of the world's largest democracy, did not attend the event, underscoring unease among some members about the direction the SCO is taking.\n\nFounded in 2001 by China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to combat terrorism and promote border security, the SCO has grown in recent years in line with Beijing and Moscow's shared ambition to counter what they see as US hegemony and reshape the international system in its favor.\n\nIn 2017, the bloc underwent its first expansion to welcome India and Pakistan. With the addition of Belarus, it will have 10 members, representing more than 40% of the world's population and about a quarter of the global economy. The organization also has two observer states, Afghanistan and Mongolia, and more than a dozen dialogue partners ranging from Myanmar to Turkey and Arab states.\n\nThe SCO's expansion comes after another bloc led by China and Russia, the BRICS group of major emerging economies, more than doubled its membership and significantly expanded its global reach last year.\n\nAs the SCO has gained international visibility and economic clout, it has also expanded its geopolitical ambitions.\n\nThe expected admission of Belarus, a country bordering the European Union, highlights how the SCO's mission has changed in recent years, said Eva Seiwert, a China foreign policy expert at the Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS) in Berlin.\n\nUnlike Iran, Belarus' entry does not really result in much economic or security cooperation. That is why I argue that this is another geopolitical move.\n\nWith Russia deeply embroiled in the third year of its grueling war with Ukraine, the SCO has become a crucial diplomatic channel for Putin, as well as a platform to show that he is not isolated on the international stage.\n\nAs relations between China and the United States have collapsed, Beijing is now less concerned about the SCO being labeled an anti-Western organization -- a perception that has only deepened after Iran's admission, Seiwert said.\n\nThey want the SCO to be seen as a large bloc that can no longer be ignored, she said. With all these countries together, both China and Russia (who want to show it) have many supporters for their worldview.\n\nAnd in this common worldview, there is no place for the United States in Eurasia. At a meeting with senior Foreign Ministry officials last month, Putin outlined a future vision of a new system of bilateral and multilateral collective security guarantees in Eurasia, with the help of existing organizations like the SCO, and a long-term goal of gradually eliminating the military presence of external powers in the Eurasian region.\n\nDuring my recent visit to China, President Xi Jinping and I discussed this issue. It was noted that the Russian proposal is not contradictory, but rather comprehensive and is in line with the basic principles of China's global security initiative, Putin said, visiting Beijing in May.\n\nThis grand vision of an alternative future will be the main message to China and Russia at this SCO summit, said Bates Gill, a senior fellow at the National Bureau of Asian Research.\n\nBut Belarus' membership also creates big question marks that will weigh on the organization, Gill said.\n\nThis creates all sorts of problems and new questions about the reputation, legitimacy and mandate of the organization, given the nature of the Belarusian regime and its blatant support for Russia's violation of international law and invasion of Ukraine, he said.\n\nObviously, the SCO can tolerate authoritarian regimes, but for the organization's mandate, this further diversifies and dilutes its initial orientation, which was focused on Central Asia.\n\nThe bloc's expansion has not been without friction - notably the admission of bitter rivals India and Pakistan - while tensions between Beijing and New Delhi have also risen in recent years following deadly clashes on the disputed Himalayan border.\n\nThe group's increasingly anti-Western orientation following the admission of Iran and now Belarus has also fueled unease among members who want to maintain good relations with the West, including with former Soviet states in Central Asia.\n\nIn some ways, this puts the Central Asian states in a very uncomfortable position, Gill said. They are pursuing what they like to call multi-vector diplomacy. They don't want to commit to dealing with just one major power, like Russia or China.\n\nGill, who visited Central Asia in April and May, said there was ambivalence in regional capitals about the future of the SCO.\n\nIndia also seemed to be losing interest. Last year, the country hosted the summit virtually -- a low-key arrangement that allowed Modi to avoid the ethics of hosting Putin and Xi in New Delhi while seeking closer ties with the United States.\n\nThis year, newly sworn in for his third consecutive term, the Indian leader is absent from the Astana summit - despite reports in Russian state media that he will visit the Kremlin next week.\n\nThis tells us that the SCO is not the most effective channel to defend Indian interests in this part of the world, Gill said.\n\nEven China, the main force behind the SCO expansion, is seeking a more direct way to interact with Central Asia - without Russia's participation.\n\nLast year, five regional leaders were lavishly welcomed at the inaugural China-Central Asia summit in the Chinese city of Xi'an, the starting point of the ancient Silk Road trade route that linked imperial China with Western civilizations. recently. In March, a permanent secretariat for the China-Central Asia mechanism was established in the same city.\n\nAnd while China and Russia aspire to present the SCO as a counterweight to US-led institutions, it remains a much weaker and less cohesive bloc than NATO, the European Union or the Group of Seven.\n\nGiven the increased membership with India, Pakistan, Iran and Belarus, the organization will look even less like a common alliance or committed group, and more like a strategic vision-type organization...representing a Eurasian identity, Gill said.\n\nAfter the Astana summit, China is expected to take over the rotating chairmanship of the SCO for one year. Seiwert, the MERICS expert, said Beijing would try to find common ground among member states.\n\nFor China, it is important that the SCO does not fail, that it is seen as a success. I think they are also aware of all the difficulties associated with all these different expansions, she said.\n\nIf it continues to grow - if Russia and China continue to strive to expand - then I think its regional relevance will actually diminish.",

        "summary": "The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), a Eurasian bloc led by China and Russia, is set to admit Belarus, a staunch Russian ally, at its annual summit in Astana, Kazakhstan. This move aims to transform the SCO from a regional security group into a geopolitical counterweight to Western institutions led by the US. Belarus, which supported Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, joins the SCO following Iran's admission last year. The summit, attended by Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin, but not Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, underscores the bloc's growing anti-Western orientation. Founded in 2001, the SCO now includes 10 members, representing over 40% of the global population and about a quarter of the world economy. The expansion raises questions about the organization's legitimacy and mandate, especially given Belarus' controversial support for Russia. The SCO's increasing geopolitical ambitions and anti-Western stance create tensions among members, particularly Central Asian states and India, who seek balanced relations with the West. Despite these challenges, China, set to chair the SCO next year, aims to maintain the bloc's cohesion and success."

        "body": "The U.S. Department of the Treasury recently proposed new rules that seek to strengthen regulations against money laundering and terror financing and to ensure such security programs are effective in the current scenario.\n\nThe proposed rule targets anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) programs implemented at financial institutions like banks. It requires entities to adopt more stringent policies to counter such activities.\n\n\"The proposed rule is a critical part of our efforts to ensure that the AML/CFT regime is working to protect our financial system from longstanding threats like corruption, fraud, and international terrorism, as well as rapidly evolving and acute threats, such as domestic terrorism, and ransomware and other cybercrime,\" said Andrea Gacki, director of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) in a June 28 press release.\n\nThe new rules mandate institutions to amend their existing programs and explicitly require the establishment of effective anti-money laundering programs with certain minimum requirements including a mandatory risk assessment process.\n\nFinCEN further requires financial firms to work with and incorporate \"government-wide AML/CFT priorities,\" and promote clarity and consistency with new changes regarding laundering and terrorist financing activities.\n\nThe rule requires that AML/CFT programs have a designated individual or group of individuals tasked with coordinating and monitoring everyday compliance with related activities.\n\nInstitutions are required to have their anti-money laundering programs independently audited, in large part to assess whether these programs are adequate to combat illicit activities.\n\nThe report identified five key contributors to money laundering risks in the United States: misuse of legal entities; lack of AML/CFT coverage in sectors like investment advisory; the lack of transparency in real estate transactions; compliance and supervision weaknesses at regulated financial institutions; and merchants and professionals misusing their positions.\n\nThe Treasury Department found that the United States continued to face a \"wide range of terrorist financing threats.\" In addition to the terrorist organization Hamas exploiting the international financial system, the report also detailed violent extremist movements within America.\n\n\"Whether it's terrorism, drug trafficking, Russian aggression, or corruption, illicit finance is the common thread across our nation's biggest national security threats,\" said Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian E. Nelson.\n\n\"Treasury, through our National Risk Assessments, is at the cutting edge of analyzing the global risk environment to protect the U.S. and international financial systems from abuse by illicit actors.\"\n\nThe Treasury has recently taken several actions to crack down on money laundering operations that threaten the country.\n\nOn July 1, the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned money launderers based in Mexico and China who were linked to the Sinaloa Cartel, a major drug syndicate. The actions were taken as part of an effort to disrupt the inflow of narcotics into the United States.\n\nLast month, the OFAC sanctioned almost 50 individuals and entities that were part of a vast \"shadow banking\" network used by Iranian entities to gain illicit access to the global financial system.\n\nThe network was used, for example, by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL) to process billions of dollars in funds from 2020.\n\nSubsidiaries of MODAFL are known to manufacture ballistic missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles that are not only used by the Iranian military but also exported to terrorist groups like the Houthis based in Yemen.",

        "title": "Blinken attempts to bully China for its relations with Russia - BLiTZ",
        "body": "In a move likely to stoke geopolitical tensions, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken recently turned his attention to China, asserting that its support for Russia is exacerbating the most significant security threat in Europe since the Cold War. These comments come just a week before the NATO Summit in Washington, DC, and have been interpreted by experts as a strategic attempt to align European allies with Washington's geopolitical agenda, while simultaneously creating divisions and inciting chaos, potentially sparking \"another Ukraine crisis\" in Asia.\n\nBlinken's remarks, delivered at the Brookings Institution-a prominent Washington-based think tank-have added fuel to an already volatile international landscape. Blinken claimed that China's actions were contributing to Europe's greatest security threat and stressed that this sentiment is echoed by China's neighbors in Asia. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg echoed Blinken's rhetoric, accusing China of aiding Russia in inciting the largest military conflict in Europe since World War II by providing advanced technology for missile and drone production.\n\nChina was quick to rebuff these allegations. Mao Ning, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, responded to Blinken's comments at a press briefing, condemning the US for its attempts to provoke conflict. Mao questioned the values purportedly upheld by NATO, suggesting that if they involve creating conflicts and escalating tensions, China cannot endorse them. She argued that NATO has consistently interfered in China's domestic affairs, misrepresented its policies, and posed significant threats to China's interests and security.\n\nRegarding the Ukraine crisis, Mao reiterated China's commitment to promoting peaceful dialogue and finding a political solution. She urged NATO to reflect on its role in the crisis and focus on its contributions to peace in Europe and globally, rather than deflecting blame onto others.\n\nBlinken's statements are seen by many as a calculated move to drive a wedge between China and Europe, as well as between Russia and Europe. Li Haidong, a professor at China Foreign Affairs University, suggested that Blinken's rhetoric is designed to maintain US dominance and keep Europe in a subordinate position. By inciting division, the US aims to prompt its European allies to increase their investments in resources and capabilities directed toward engaging in a geopolitical competition with China. This strategy could potentially lead to the creation of a \"mini-NATO\" in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nMoreover, experts believe that the US is attempting to hinder China's development by complicating its internal and external environment, thereby ensuring America's continued global supremacy. This approach, however, is criticized as shortsighted and ultimately detrimental to US interests.\n\nThe rise of right-wing political forces in Europe adds another layer of complexity to this situation. Blinken's attempt to rally European allies against China might not be as effective as anticipated. There is a possibility of strong backlash and controversy, as European nations might resist being drawn into another geopolitical conflict orchestrated by Washington.\n\nBlinken emphasized the relevance of Asian challenges to European partners, citing a joint statement by NATO and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. The statement, made in the wake of the Ukraine crisis, suggested that events in Europe could easily be replicated in Asia, highlighting the interconnectedness of global security threats.\n\nWashington's approach, as noted by experts, seems to aim at inciting another crisis in Asia similar to the Ukraine conflict. For the US, global peace and stability do not align with its hegemonic aspirations. Instead, a turbulent world serves to maintain American dominance. This strategy, however, is transparent to many Asian and European countries, which recognize the US's intentions to incite chaos to secure its global standing.\n\nLi Haidong pointed out the potential for significant backlash against Blinken's statements. With the growing influence of right-wing nationalists in Europe, there is a strong likelihood that these remarks will not be well-received, and could instead foster greater resistance to US policies.\n\nBlinken's recent accusations against China reflect a broader strategy by the US to consolidate its influence and maintain its hegemonic position. By attempting to draw European allies into its geopolitical schemes and incite divisions, Washington risks provoking further instability. The reaction from China, as well as the potential backlash from European nations, underscores the complexity and volatility of the current international landscape. As the NATO Summit approaches, the implications of these developments will undoubtedly be a focal point of discussion among global leaders.",

        "title": "Biden's struggle and Trump's return: Age, Politics, and global consequences - BLiTZ",
        "body": "Joe Biden, the current President of the United States, recently faced one of his most challenging moments on the political stage. In a debate against his formidable opponent, Donald Trump, Biden's age seemed to catch up with him in a way that was unmistakable to tens of millions of viewers. The spectacle of this showdown highlighted not only the intense scrutiny politicians endure but also the merciless nature of public opinion and media.\n\nBiden's struggle during the debate was a stark reminder of how age can betray even the most seasoned leaders at critical junctures. In this highly anticipated and widely watched event, Biden failed to perform convincingly both as an attacker and a defender. He appeared unable to maintain the composure and sharpness that are crucial in such high-stakes encounters. This public faltering transformed what might have been seen as a minor setback into a perceived catastrophe.\n\nThe modern political landscape is unforgiving, especially under the relentless spotlight of social media, where commentators and critics can be particularly harsh. The slightest sign of weakness is often amplified, with slanderous and wolfish attacks that can sway public opinion dramatically. This environment is particularly unforgiving for a president seeking re-election, as any perceived decline in capability can have dire consequences for their campaign.\n\nWithin the Democratic Party, there is growing concern about Biden's ability to lead the charge into the next election. Prominent voices, including The New York Times, have suggested that Biden should consider stepping aside. This sentiment has been echoed by various party members who fear that his continued presence might lead to an unavoidable defeat. However, replacing a sitting president in the middle of a campaign is not a simple task. It involves complex political maneuvers and would require Biden's own agreement to step down -- a challenging prospect for any politician.\n\nJill Biden, the president's wife, has been seen by some as a potential influencer who might persuade her husband to make this tough decision for the greater good of the party and the country. Similarly, former President Barack Obama is also expected to play a crucial role in guiding Biden through this difficult period.\n\nConvincing a lifelong politician to retire is no easy feat. The allure of power and the prestige of office are hard to relinquish, especially for someone who has spent decades in public service, culminating in the presidency. The psychological attachment to power is profound, making the prospect of stepping down akin to accepting defeat. This was exemplified in an anecdote where a wise politician, despite his advanced age, could not easily detach himself from the presidential palace-a symbol of his enduring connection to power.\n\nThe recent debate not only highlighted Biden's personal challenges but also underscored the broader issues facing America. In an era of rapid technological advancements and geopolitical shifts, the country appears to be struggling to put forth a younger, dynamic candidate for the highest office. This has led to deeper divisions within the nation and increased uncertainty on the global stage.\n\nThe potential re-election of Trump adds another layer of complexity to this scenario. Known for his unpredictable policies and unorthodox approach, Trump represents a significant departure from traditional political norms. His return to the White House would likely exacerbate existing tensions both domestically and internationally. Allies and adversaries alike are wary of his volatile leadership style, which contrasts sharply with Biden's institutional approach.\n\nThe stakes in the upcoming election are incredibly high, not just for the United States but for the world at large. Trump's potential victory raises questions about America's role in global affairs, particularly concerning relations with Russia and China. Trump's perceived lack of seriousness about the \"Russian threat\" and his focus on China as the primary adversary suggest a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy priorities.\n\nIn Europe, there is widespread concern about the implications of a Trump presidency. Leaders worry that Trump's deal-making mentality might lead to compromises that could undermine European security, particularly in the face of Russian aggression. The fear of a repeat of the appeasement policies of the past looms large, with many drawing parallels to the pre-World War II era.\n\nIn the Middle East, the situation remains volatile with ongoing conflicts in Gaza and the potential for a wider war involving Lebanon. The prospect of a Trump-led administration complicates efforts to achieve a lasting peace, particularly given his controversial decision to assassinate Iranian General Qassem Soleimani. Negotiating with Iran under a Trump presidency would likely be fraught with difficulties, casting a shadow over any potential nuclear agreement.\n\nAs the 2024 election approaches, the political landscape is fraught with uncertainty. Biden's apparent vulnerability and the prospect of Trump's return to power have created a highly charged atmosphere. The decisions made in the coming months will not only shape the future of American politics but also have far-reaching implications for global stability and security.\n\nIn this high-stakes environment, the American electorate faces a crucial choice. Will they opt for continuity with Biden, despite the challenges of his age and performance, or will they take a gamble on Trump, with all the unpredictability that entails? The outcome of this decision will reverberate far beyond the borders of the United States, influencing the course of international relations for years to come.",

        "summary": "The article discusses the recent political challenges faced by U.S. President Joe Biden, particularly during a debate with former President Donald Trump. Biden's performance, hindered by his age, raised concerns about his ability to lead, especially as he seeks re-election. The debate highlighted the harsh scrutiny politicians face, amplified by social media. Within the Democratic Party, there is growing unease about Biden's viability as a candidate, with some suggesting he step aside, a complex and difficult decision. Key figures like Jill Biden and Barack Obama may influence this decision.\n\nThe article also explores the broader implications of the upcoming 2024 election. Trump's potential return to the presidency introduces significant uncertainty, given his unpredictable policies and departure from traditional norms. This has global ramifications, particularly concerning U.S. relations with Russia, China, and European allies, as well as ongoing conflicts in the Middle East. The election's outcome will significantly impact both American politics and international stability, presenting the electorate with a critical choice between continuity with Biden or the unpredictability of Trump."

        "body": "KUALA LUMPUR: CIMB Group Holdings Bhd will no longer provide new dedicated financing for upstream oil fields starting from Jan 1, 2025.\n\nThis is a part of the bank's 2030 decarbonisation targets that was unveiled in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.\n\nThe group stated this policy applied to upstream oil fields approved for development after Dec 31, 2021. To assist its oil and gas (O&G) clients in their decarbonisation efforts, CIMB will also be reducing the Financed Emissions Lending Intensity of its O&G portfolio by 16% by 2030.\n\nCIMB is the first local bank to complete its 2030 decarbonisation target setting for high-emitting sectors. This is part of its broader 2050 net-zero commitments that include thermal coal mining, cement, palm oil and power.\n\nAnother sector was real estate, where the group has announced its target to reduce the operational emissions intensity of its commercial real estate portfolio by 34% by 2030.\n\nAddressing concerns on whether this means the bank will drastically shift away from certain clients, CIMB Malaysia and CIMB Bank chief executive officer Gurdip Singh Sidhu said it will not be the case.\n\n\"We are taking a very consultative and collaborative approach. When we were coming up with these targets, for critical sectors like O&G and palm oil, we engaged with industry players, bodies and major clients to align our targets with their trajectories and plans.\n\n\"Moreover, for all sectors, with the exception of coal, our total outstanding financing with clients is expected to increase leading up to 2030.\n\n\"So, to say that we think by doing this (setting targets) it may negatively affect our business growth, that will certainly not be the case because we are projecting growth in all those sectors,\" he said during the CIMB Sustainability Roundtable 2024.\n\nCIMB has also updated its previously published white paper detailing its decarbonisation plans, delineating sector-specific pathways and immediate strategies for all six sectors, which collectively accounts for 60% of its financing portfolio emissions as of 2023.\n\nGurdip, who also oversees the overall group sustainability efforts in CIMB, said many corporations are already feeling the push towards greener operations due to mechanisms like the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).\n\n\"Many of our clients exporting to Europe will soon realise, if they haven't already, that their products could become marginally less competitive compared to those of producers in other countries with greener operations.\n\n\"This is because products exported from Malaysia may incur higher carbon taxes under the European Union's regulations,\" he said.\n\nNevertheless, Gurdip contends that to assume there would not be any challenges, both internally and externally, in the implementation of the targets would be overly optimistic.\n\n\"We do not foresee internal challenges, like our bankers choosing not to subscribe to this pathway and giving out loans to the coal sector, for example, to be an issue that will curtail us from achieving our targets. We believe we have put enough safeguards in our process,\" he said.\n\n\"The external dependencies and challenges are the ones that we are not in full control of.\n\n\"For instance, the trade off on the balance with a just transition like with the Russia-Ukraine war. The spike in energy prices that took place when the war started created trade-offs between prioritising net-zero goals and securing energy supplies, be it clean or not so clean,\" he said.\n\nEven so, Gurdip said the group remains confident in the momentum towards sustainability, looking at the pace of progress since the company started its sustainability journey in 2019.\n\n\"As we pursue our 2050 goals, we will encounter some speed bumps along the way. However, given that Malaysia is a very big trading country, where exports have a big part, so even if government policies do not move as quickly as what was originally planned, the push and pull factor as a result of things like the CBAM will be a catalyst,\" he said.\n\nIn addition to the 2030 climate targets, CIMB has increased its sustainable finance target to RM100bil by 2024, surpassing RM86.2bil as of December last year.\n\nGurdip said that for large corporations, CIMB has launched the sustainability linked loan facility which the group has committed RM3bil to.\n\n\"We have deployed a certain chunk of that. This is essentially setting targets for clients. It also acts as an incentive for them to achieve those targets, so that they can get rebates on the interest rates of their loan,\" he said.",

        "title": "Dark Star Announces Letter of Intent to Purchase Uranium Assets in the Central Mineral Belt of Newfoundland/Labrador",
        "body": "Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - July 3, 2024) - DARK STAR MINERALS INC. (CSE: BATT) (FSE: P0W) (the \"Company\" or \"Dark Star\") is pleased to announce that the Company has entered into a letter of intent (the \"LOI\") to acquire (the \"Acquisition\") all of the outstanding share capital of Ghost Lake Mining Corp (\"Ghost Lake\"). Ghost Lake holds an option to purchase a 100 % interest in the Ghost Lake mining claims (the \"Property\").\n\nMarc Branson, President, Chief Executive Officer and a director of Dark Star stated: \"We are very excited to expand our exploration prospects into Uranium. This purchase will give the Company the ability to be on the forefront of exploring for critical minerals and fulfilling our mission of creating Canada's energy independence through exploration\".\n\nAbout the Property and Central Mineral Belt\n\nLocated in the prolific Central Mineral Belt (CMB) of Labrador, the Ghost Lake Property consists of 28,575 Ha of contiguous claim blocks. The Property is bound on three sides (N, W, E) by [properties held by] Atha Energy Corp. (the \"Atha Properties\") and overlaps structural trends with known deposits such as Paladin Energy Ltd.'s Michelin Project, Labrador Uranium Inc.'s, and the Mustang Lake and Jacques Lake deposits. The CMB is a diverse geological environment and is host to widespread uranium mineralization. The neighboring Atha Properties host a number of uranium deposits, including the Anna Lake, Moran Lake, and Mustang deposits while Paladin Energy hosts the Michelin Uranium Project. Mineralization on the neighbouring properties is not indicative of potential mineralization on the Ghost Lake Property.\n\nTargets on the Ghost Lake Property focus on areas of Radiometric Uranium highs over 0.5km2 from regional airborne surveys. Primary targets include: Anomaly 24_1, an uranium radiometric anomaly in proximity to historic uranium lake sediment samples, and Anomaly 24_3 (~15km2), which is located along the western margin of Ghost Lake and covers historic \"Anomaly B\". The property wide northeast trending corridor is prospective for structurally related uranium mineralization. The corridor is defined by anomalous uranium lake sediment samples, along a north east trending fault that transects the peripheries of radiometric anomalies.\n\nThe claims overly the southern margin of the CMB, a northeast-trending, 260 x 75 km belt of Proterozoic volcanic and sedimentary rocks and associated granites. The south-western margin of the Project straddles the boundary between granitoid rocks of the Trans Labrador Batholith and the Proterozoic Bruce River Group while the northern edge of the Property overlies a 12km section Mesoarchean Makkovik granitoid gneiss.\n\nBayswater Uranium Corporation performed exploration in the northeast part of the current Ghost Lake Project area between 2006 and 2009. Exploration included an airborne radiometric surveys as well as a ground based radon gas sample grid, along with minimal traverses. Bayswater was successful in identifying distinct radiometric targets around Ghost Lake. Ghost Lake anomaly B occurs at the west end of the lake, within the claim boundaries and is characterized by a distribution of high radiometric values. Bayswater later completed a Radon Gas soil survey over Anomaly B. Survey results from anomaly B indicated several NE-SW anomalous trends of moderate to high radon flux (Third Year Assessment Report on the Labrador, Central Mineral Belt Project , 2009, Fraser, R.D., Thomas, A., Galbraith, C.).\n\nSantory Resources and Mega Uranium completed field work from 2005 - 2008 in the southwest part of the current Ghost Lake Project. The cumulation of their fieldwork including airborne, water, and lake sediment surveys as well as prospecting resulted in identification of a property wide northeast-southwest prospective corridor. The corridor host numerous anomalous uranium lake sediment samples, coinciding with a regional fault along the peripheries of radiometric anomalies (Third Year Assessment Report of Lake Sediment, Lake Water, Surface Water Geochemistry Sampling, and Prospecting on Licenses 10359M, 10779M, 013573, and 013730M Gravelly River Property, Mega Uranium LTD, March 2008,, Gilman, T.L.)\n\n.\n\nSummary of the Acquisition as set out by the LOI\n\nPursuant to the terms of the LOI, the Company and Ghost Lake will enter into a definitive agreement (the \"Agreement\") which will include consideration payable by the Company to Ghost Lake through the issuance of: (i) 10,000,000 common shares of Dark Star (the \"Consideration Shares\"); and (ii) 10,000,000 Dark Star warrants where each warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Dark Star common share, exercisable for a period of two years beginning on the date of the Acquisition, at an exercise price equal to the greater of: (a) $0.20 per share; and (b) the lowest price permitted under the policies of the Canadian Securities Exchange (the \"Warrants\").\n\nThe sole asset of Ghost Lake is an option agreement to acquire 100% of the Ghost Lake mining Claims from Cronin Exploration Inc. (\"Cronin\").

Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as: \"believes\", \"expects\", \"anticipates\", \"intends\", \"estimates\", \"plans\", \"may\", \"should\", \"would\", \"will\", \"potential\", \"scheduled\" or variations of such words and phrases and similar expressions, which, by their nature, refer to future events or results that may, could, would, might or will occur or be taken or achieved. All statements in this news release that are not purely historical are forward-looking statements and include statements regarding beliefs, plans, expectations and orientations regarding the future. Although the Company believes that such statements are reasonable and reflect expectations of future developments and other factors which management believes to be reasonable and relevant, the Company can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. In making the forward-looking statements in this news release, the Company has applied several material assumptions, including without limitation, that market fundamentals will support the viability of critical mineral resource exploration, the availability of the financing required for the Company to carry out its planned future activities, and the availability of and the ability to retain and attract qualified personnel. Other factors may also adversely affect the future results or performance of the Company, including general economic, market or business conditions, future prices of minerals, changes in the financial markets and in the demand for minerals, changes in laws, regulations and policies affecting the mineral exploration industry, as well as the risks and uncertainties which are more fully described in the Company's annual and quarterly management's discussion and analysis and in other filings made by the Company with Canadian securities regulatory authorities under the Company's SEDAR profile. Ongoing labour shortages, inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, the global financial climate and the conflict in Ukraine and surrounding regions are some additional factors that are affecting current economic conditions and increasing economic uncertainty, which may impact the Company's operating performance, financial position, and future prospects. Collectively, the potential impacts of this economic environment pose risks that are currently indescribable and immeasurable. No assurance can be given that any of the events anticipated by the forward-looking statements will occur or, if they do occur, what benefits the Company will obtain from them. Readers are cautioned that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and, accordingly, are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty of such statements. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update such forward‐looking information whether because of new information, future events or otherwise, except as expressly required by applicable law.\n\nNeither the CSE nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the CSE) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.",

        "body": "Marc Branson, President, Chief Executive Officer and a director of Dark Star stated: \"We are very excited to expand our exploration prospects into Uranium. This purchase will give the Company the ability to be on the forefront of exploring for critical minerals and fulfilling our mission of creating Canada's energy independence through exploration\".\n\nAbout the Property and Central Mineral Belt\n\nLocated in the prolific Central Mineral Belt (CMB) of Labrador, the Ghost Lake Property consists of 28,575 Ha of contiguous claim blocks. The Property is bound on three sides (N, W, E) by [properties held by] Atha Energy Corp. (the \"Atha Properties\") and overlaps structural trends with known deposits such as Paladin Energy Ltd.'s Michelin Project, Labrador Uranium Inc.'s, and the Mustang Lake and Jacques Lake deposits. The CMB is a diverse geological environment and is host to widespread uranium mineralization. The neighboring Atha Properties host a number of uranium deposits, including the Anna Lake, Moran Lake, and Mustang deposits while Paladin Energy hosts the Michelin Uranium Project. Mineralization on the neighbouring properties is not indicative of potential mineralization on the Ghost Lake Property.\n\nTargets on the Ghost Lake Property focus on areas of Radiometric Uranium highs over 0.5km from regional airborne surveys. Primary targets include: Anomaly 24_1, an uranium radiometric anomaly in proximity to historic uranium lake sediment samples, and Anomaly 24_3 (~15km), which is located along the western margin of Ghost Lake and covers historic \"Anomaly B\". The property wide northeast trending corridor is prospective for structurally related uranium mineralization. The corridor is defined by anomalous uranium lake sediment samples, along a north east trending fault that transects the peripheries of radiometric anomalies.\n\nThe claims overly the southern margin of the CMB, a northeast-trending, 260 x 75 km belt of Proterozoic volcanic and sedimentary rocks and associated granites. The south-western margin of the Project straddles the boundary between granitoid rocks of the Trans Labrador Batholith and the Proterozoic Bruce River Group while the northern edge of the Property overlies a 12km section Mesoarchean Makkovik granitoid gneiss.\n\nBayswater Uranium Corporation performed exploration in the northeast part of the current Ghost Lake Project area between 2006 and 2009. Exploration included an airborne radiometric surveys as well as a ground based radon gas sample grid, along with minimal traverses. Bayswater was successful in identifying distinct radiometric targets around Ghost Lake. Ghost Lake anomaly B occurs at the west end of the lake, within the claim boundaries and is characterized by a distribution of high radiometric values. Bayswater later completed a Radon Gas soil survey over Anomaly B. Survey results from anomaly B indicated several NE-SW anomalous trends of moderate to high radon flux (Third Year Assessment Report on the Labrador, Central Mineral Belt Project , 2009, Fraser, R.D., Thomas, A., Galbraith, C.).\n\nSantory Resources and Mega Uranium completed field work from 2005 - 2008 in the southwest part of the current Ghost Lake Project. The cumulation of their fieldwork including airborne, water, and lake sediment surveys as well as prospecting resulted in identification of a property wide northeast-southwest prospective corridor. The corridor host numerous anomalous uranium lake sediment samples, coinciding with a regional fault along the peripheries of radiometric anomalies (Third Year Assessment Report of Lake Sediment, Lake Water, Surface Water Geochemistry Sampling, and Prospecting on Licenses 10359M, 10779M, 013573, and 013730M Gravelly River Property, Mega Uranium LTD, March 2008,, Gilman, T.L.)\n\n.\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/9815/215359_68f9b49814486b99_002full.jpg\n\nSummary of the Acquisition as set out by the LOI\n\nPursuant to the terms of the LOI, the Company and Ghost Lake will enter into a definitive agreement (the \"Agreement\") which will include consideration payable by the Company to Ghost Lake through the issuance of: (i) 10,000,000 common shares of Dark Star (the \"Consideration Shares\"); and (ii) 10,000,000 Dark Star warrants where each warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Dark Star common share, exercisable for a period of two years beginning on the date of the Acquisition, at an exercise price equal to the greater of: (a) $0.20 per share; and (b) the lowest price permitted under the policies of the Canadian Securities Exchange (the \"Warrants\").\n\nThe sole asset of Ghost Lake is an option agreement to acquire 100% of the Ghost Lake mining Claims from Cronin Exploration Inc.

        "body": "Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - July 3, 2024) - DARK STAR MINERALS INC. (CSE: BATT) (FSE: P0W) (the \"Company\" or \"Dark Star\") is pleased to announce that the Company has entered into a letter of intent (the \"LOI\") to acquire (the \"Acquisition\") all of the outstanding share capital of Ghost Lake Mining Corp (\"Ghost Lake\"). Ghost Lake holds an option to purchase a 100 % interest in the Ghost Lake mining claims (the \"Property\").\n\nMarc Branson, President, Chief Executive Officer and a director of Dark Star stated: \"We are very excited to expand our exploration prospects into Uranium. This purchase will give the Company the ability to be on the forefront of exploring for critical minerals and fulfilling our mission of creating Canada's energy independence through exploration\".\n\nAbout the Property and Central Mineral Belt\n\nLocated in the prolific Central Mineral Belt (CMB) of Labrador, the Ghost Lake Property consists of 28,575 Ha of contiguous claim blocks. The Property is bound on three sides (N, W, E) by [properties held by] Atha Energy Corp. (the \"Atha Properties\") and overlaps structural trends with known deposits such as Paladin Energy Ltd.'s Michelin Project, Labrador Uranium Inc.'s, and the Mustang Lake and Jacques Lake deposits. The CMB is a diverse geological environment and is host to widespread uranium mineralization. The neighboring Atha Properties host a number of uranium deposits, including the Anna Lake, Moran Lake, and Mustang deposits while Paladin Energy hosts the Michelin Uranium Project. Mineralization on the neighbouring properties is not indicative of potential mineralization on the Ghost Lake Property.\n\nTargets on the Ghost Lake Property focus on areas of Radiometric Uranium highs over 0.5km2 from regional airborne surveys. Primary targets include: Anomaly 24_1, an uranium radiometric anomaly in proximity to historic uranium lake sediment samples, and Anomaly 24_3 (~15km2), which is located along the western margin of Ghost Lake and covers historic \"Anomaly B\". The property wide northeast trending corridor is prospective for structurally related uranium mineralization. The corridor is defined by anomalous uranium lake sediment samples, along a north east trending fault that transects the peripheries of radiometric anomalies.\n\nThe claims overly the southern margin of the CMB, a northeast-trending, 260 x 75 km belt of Proterozoic volcanic and sedimentary rocks and associated granites. The south-western margin of the Project straddles the boundary between granitoid rocks of the Trans Labrador Batholith and the Proterozoic Bruce River Group while the northern edge of the Property overlies a 12km section Mesoarchean Makkovik granitoid gneiss.\n\nBayswater Uranium Corporation performed exploration in the northeast part of the current Ghost Lake Project area between 2006 and 2009. Exploration included an airborne radiometric surveys as well as a ground based radon gas sample grid, along with minimal traverses. Bayswater was successful in identifying distinct radiometric targets around Ghost Lake. Ghost Lake anomaly B occurs at the west end of the lake, within the claim boundaries and is characterized by a distribution of high radiometric values. Bayswater later completed a Radon Gas soil survey over Anomaly B. Survey results from anomaly B indicated several NE-SW anomalous trends of moderate to high radon flux (Third Year Assessment Report on the Labrador, Central Mineral Belt Project , 2009, Fraser, R.D., Thomas, A., Galbraith, C.).\n\nSantory Resources and Mega Uranium completed field work from 2005 - 2008 in the southwest part of the current Ghost Lake Project. The cumulation of their fieldwork including airborne, water, and lake sediment surveys as well as prospecting resulted in identification of a property wide northeast-southwest prospective corridor. The corridor host numerous anomalous uranium lake sediment samples, coinciding with a regional fault along the peripheries of radiometric anomalies (Third Year Assessment Report of Lake Sediment, Lake Water, Surface Water Geochemistry Sampling, and Prospecting on Licenses 10359M, 10779M, 013573, and 013730M Gravelly River Property, Mega Uranium LTD, March 2008\" Gilman, T.L.)\n\n.\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/9815/215359_68f9b49814486b99_002full.jpg\n\nSummary of the Acquisition as set out by the LOI\n\nPursuant to the terms of the LOI, the Company and Ghost Lake will enter into a definitive agreement (the \"Agreement\") which will include consideration payable by the Company to Ghost Lake through the issuance of: (i) 10,000,000 common shares of Dark Star (the \"Consideration Shares\"); and (ii) 10,000,000 Dark Star warrants where each warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Dark Star common share, exercisable for a period of two years beginning on the date of the Acquisition, at an exercise price equal to the greater of: (a) $0.20 per share; and (b) the lowest price permitted under the policies of the Canadian Securities Exchange (the \"Warrants\").\n\nThe sole asset of Ghost Lake is an option agreement to acquire 100% of the Ghost Lake mining Claims from Cronin Exploration Inc. (\"Cronin\").

        "title": "Thank you, Elon Musk",
        "body": "Starlink provides reliable internet service to rural areas\n\nPresident Biden and his pals in the White House don't like Mr. Musk and avoid doing business with him, even when he offers the best solution to problems they say they want to solve.\n\nThat's a mistake.\n\nMr. Biden would say that his products aren't as good as he claims, but even the casual observer knows it's his politics. They used to like Mr. Musk, who said he voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and for Mr. Biden in 2020. In a series of interviews in the early days of the new administration, Mr. Musk said he liked the new president's agenda.\n\nStill, administration officials cut Mr. Musk from discussions promoting electric vehicles because his facilities weren't unionized. In touting electric vehicles, the president refused for months to refer in any way to Mr. Musk or his electric vehicle company, Tesla, and finally threw his support behind legislation that restricts government subsidies to EVs produced by unionized labor.\n\nThen Mr. Musk bought Twitter and released emails that revealed how the Democrats pressured social media companies to help them win the 2020 and 2022 elections. He also began criticizing Mr. Biden's economic plans and announced that he wouldn't vote for Mr. Biden in November. Since then, the White House has been doing all it can to avoid doing business with Mr. Musk despite contracts with his company SpaceX, which is vital to the space program and the communications infrastructure Ukraine relies on in its war with Russia.\n\nJust last week, another stark example of how this political animosity has hurt Americans and the Biden administration's ability to implement its own programs was revealed.\n\nIn 2021, Mr. Biden talked Congress into appropriating $42.5 billion to bring internet service to the underserved corners of rural America. Still, a recent government report reveals that not one more business, house or school has gotten access to the web under his program. The reason: Funding is restricted to potential providers willing to install costly fiber-optic cable in remote areas that could be much more easily and cheaply reached through Mr. Musk's Starlink, a subsidiary of his SpaceX, which relies on satellites rather than cable to reach its customers.\n\nMr. Biden and his Federal Communications Commission rejected Mr. Musk's approach as less reliable than what came before and excluded Starlink as a means of reaching the underserved rural areas of the country.\n\nMr. Musk is best known for the ubiquitous Tesla. Still, he also provides rockets used by the military and private corporations to launch satellites and out-of-the-box solutions to other problems. His Starlink system is a typical Musk solution. He began by rejecting older ways of linking people to the internet, came up with an alternative and then built it just as entrepreneurs used to do.\n\nUkraine had no qualms about Starlink. Their military relies on Mr. Musk's service for communication in the war with Russia. When Vladimir Putin's army invaded, Mr. Musk immediately donated Starlink access and terminals to Ukraine. It is estimated that Mr. Musk provided as much as $100 million worth of equipment and service, and without his assistance, that country might not have survived the early days of the war.\n\nBut one doesn't have to go to Ukraine to find support for Starlink. A million and a half Americans have Starlink and, like the Ukrainian military, beg to differ. For decades, my wife and I spent as much time as we could in rural Montana, but for most of this time, there was little or no practical access to the internet anywhere near our home. I was, at the time, opinion editor of The Washington Times, so I had to review the work of our contributors and get their copy and my own to the paper every day.\n\nThe satellite hookups available at the time never worked, so I drove 35 miles one way every morning to the nearest McDonald's for coffee and Wi-Fi. It was inconvenient, but the chain's reliable Wi-Fi was far better than its hamburgers, and the daily 70-mile round trip became routine.\n\nThen, the local phone company offered a bundle that included cellphone and internet service via satellite. It was expensive, less reliable, and couldn't compare to McDonald's service. It didn't come with coffee, and it worked in only one part of the house.\n\nEventually, my wife came to the rescue, as she often does. She had lobbied for regulations that opened up the satellite industry and was waiting for Mr. Musk's Starlink to provide service in our area. Now, thanks to Elon Musk, we have reliable, fast internet service not just in the house but also in my workshop and on the outside deck, where I can write overlooking one of my favorite trout streams.",

        "summary": "The article discusses the political tension between President Biden and Elon Musk, highlighting how it has impacted the implementation of internet services in rural America. Despite Musk's significant contributions through his companies, such as SpaceX and Starlink, the Biden administration has avoided collaborating with him due to political differences and unionization issues. This avoidance has led to inefficiencies, such as the failure to utilize Starlink's satellite-based internet service to provide connectivity to underserved rural areas, despite a $42.5 billion congressional appropriation in 2021 aimed at solving this problem. The article also notes Musk's critical role in supporting Ukraine's communication infrastructure during its conflict with Russia, contrasting this with the U.S. administration's reluctance to engage with his solutions. The author shares a personal anecdote about the benefits of Starlink in rural Montana, emphasizing the practical advantages of Musk's technology."

        "body": "The recently concluded G7 summit demonstrated to the world that Europe and the United States are determined to deter the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Russia from further aggression, with sanctions introduced against Chinese entities, including financial institutions that provide economic impetus for Russia to maintain its war against Ukraine.\n\nIn the G7 communiqué released on June 14, \"China\" was mentioned a rare 28 times in its elaborating of the Chinese communist regime for threatening geopolitics and peace on issues such as production overcapacity, support for the Russia-Ukraine war, \"militarization, and coercive and intimidation activities\" in the South China Sea, and other issues.\n\nLeaders from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, as well as the European Union, warned the Chinese regime against its support for the Russian war, vowing in the statement to take \"measures against actors in China and third countries that materially support Russia's war machine, including financial institutions, consistent with our legal systems, and other entities in China that facilitate Russia's acquisition of items for its defense industrial base.\"\n\nLi Hengqing, a U.S.-based Chinese economist, told The Epoch Times on June 17 that this G7 summit has reached a consensus against the CCP, a focal point of interest different from the past summits.\n\n\"In the past, those Western countries more or less considering their economic, diplomatic, and political relationship with Communist China, have always dodged naming China (CCP), but this time the G7 has made a major change, sending a clear signal that 'if the CCP furnishes resources to the Russian war, then it will be made to pay a heavy price,\" he said.\n\n\"The U.S. is targeting the CCP as a counterpart bundled with Russia,\" said Henry Wu Chia-lung, macroeconomist and lead economics researcher at Taiwan AIA Capital\n\nMr. Wu shared during the New Tang Dynasty program \"Pinnacle View\" on June 18: \"The U.S. sanctions against Russia have gone through several rafts of escalation, and now they have been further escalated to expand the sanctions against Russia's financial system, including countries with which Russian banks have business dealings, with the obvious intention of targeting the CCP.\"\n\nIt included Hong Kong trading companies that \"route payments related to gold sales through foreign financial institutions back into the Russian financial system.\"\n\nThe Treasury Department also imposed sanctions on key parts of Russia's financial infrastructure, including the Moscow Exchange, as well as its securities depository and the country's largest national clearing center.\n\nIn response, the Russian Stock Exchange suspended on June 13 trading in U.S. dollars and euros in foreign currencies and precious metals, as well as using these two currencies as financial instruments.\n\nOn June 13, the Russian central bank issued 14.2 billion yuan (about $1.96 billion) in loans to commercial banks in Russia for 174.2 billion rubles in a currency swap transaction. The day after, the bank doubled the limit of the currency swap to 20 billion yuan (about $ 2.76 billion).\n\nThe China-Russia Bilateral Local Currency Swap Arrangement was signed earlier in October 2014, when Russia was under sanctions by the West over its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea.\n\nHowever, numerous agricultural and commercial banks in northeastern provinces bordering Russia, including Jilin Bank, Changchun Farmers' and Merchants' Bank, Changchun Development Bank and Yanbian Farmers' and Merchants' Bank, continue to provide \"a freer and more flexible settlement channel for border trade\" through the Cross-Border Inter-Bank Payments System (CIPS) supported by China's central bank, according to multiple Chinese media reports.\n\nThe report said those banks shared ruble channel of Hunchun Bank's ruble channel, and \"given the transactions are mainly settled using the ruble as the currency, not the yuan, this system is outside the regulatory scope of the International Payment System (SWIFT) and won't be directly impacted [by the sanctions].\"\n\nIn this regard, Mr. Li indicated that these small banks are not directly connected to the SWIFT system, which does not mean that they can violate the U.S. and European Union bans and escape sanctions.\n\n\"If the Chinese Communist government continues to support Russia's war against Ukraine in this way, the West will eventually step in and impose sanctions on all Chinese banks. All Chinese banks are more or less state-owned, with shares linked to the Communist regime.\" Mr. Li said.",

        "title": "Fact check: New fakes on Zelenskyy's purported wealth",
        "body": "Did Ukraine's first lady Olena Zelenska just buy a million-dollar sports car? Someone presenting himself as a Paris car salesman has claimed so in a viral Instagram reel. DW's fact-checking team looked into the matter.\n\nUkraine's first lady, Olena Zelenska, has been regularly accused of going on extravagant shopping sprees while her husband, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, sends Ukrainians to war with Russia. Sometimes, she's said to have bought jewelry or a luxury yacht, other times, it was a private estate once belonging to the British royal family.\n\nFalse evidence purporting to show that the president and first lady of Ukraine are living a lavish life and have amassed untold wealth -- financed by corruption -- regularly circulates online. The most recent of these claims suggests the couple bought one or two luxury sports cars from the Italian manufacturer Bugatti as gifts for themselves on a recent trip to Paris.\n\nClaim: Ukrainian First Lady Olena Zelenska just bought a million-dollar luxury sports car.\n\nIn a video first appearing on a now-deleted Instagram account, an individual claiming to work for Groupe Schumacher, a suburban Paris car dealer, declared support for Ukraine and welcomed the Zelenskyys to the \"Bugatti family.\" Since Monday (July 1), the (archived) video has been shared millions of times on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter.\n\nAn article on the French website Verite Cachee (Hidden Truth) even claims to present an invoice for the sale. And a tweet by the notorious fake news disseminator Jackson Hinkle, in which he attempts to prop up the claim by presenting a \"copy\" of the aforementioned \"invoice,\" was seen by no less than 6.5 million X users. So, did Olena Zelenska really put in an order for a €4.5 million ($4.9 million) Bugatti Tourbillon?\n\nDW fact check: False.\n\nThe suburban Paris car dealership referenced in both the video and the invoice is real, and a manager from the business answered a DW inquiry into the online claims with a written response. The dealership said it had nothing to do with the incident, and had filed a complaint with authorities for, among other things, document forgery, identity theft and libel.\n\nThe invoice posted online contains a number of inaccuracies, which lends credence to the dealership's claim that the invoice is a forgery. Mistakes include the misspelling of the Paris suburb Neuilly-sur-Seine in the address line, the omission of obligatory sales tax information, and no mention of method of payment -- in fact, no currency is listed at all in the document.\n\nThe since-deleted video itself also raised a number of questions. The person in it moved in a suspiciously stiff manner, and his gestures as well as the tone of his voice did not seem to fit the news he was announcing. The speaker's French was full of mistakes, and his words were oddly inarticulate.\n\nAlthough these impressions could be considered subjective, the account itself also offered evidence to suggest that the video was fake.\n\nThe since-deleted Instagram account jacqes_bertin_ls was said to belong to \"automobile salesman\" Jacques Bertin. However, DW was unable to find images or references to any such a person online other than in relation to the one video in question.\n\nAll in all, the clues investigated by DW suggested that rather than being a real person, the speaker featured in the video was likely a composite created with artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe \"news\" site where the story first appeared online offers the third indication that the story was fabricated. Although the text of the story was made to look like a normal tabloid article and offered enough detail to make it appear as if it had been generated with AI, the site itself contains the hallmarks of a troll site.\n\nIt has no masthead, no author names, no picture information and no publication dates for any of its articles. Moreover, the page's jumbled layout, skewed images and awkwardly cropped images are all the likely result of sloppy programming.\n\nPerhaps the biggest red flag is the fact that nearly every article featured on the page starts with the words \"Voici un titre court pour l'article\" (Here's a short title for the article). This gives rise to the suspicion that someone, or something (like a computer program) tasked an AI chatbot with creating titles for articles and then posted the entire response on the page.\n\nThe way the false claim was distributed conforms to a pattern that has become familiar when dealing with Russian propaganda.\n\nFirstly, fake information is conceived and packaged in a way that will further the interests of the creator -- in this case, the targeted defamation of Ukraine's president.\n\nAfter that, a fake is constructed to push the false claim -- in the form of a social media video, a spoofing production (imitating an established media outlet) or a manipulated photo -- these are often created with the help of AI, or a standard image processing program.\n\nIn the next step, a fake news portal -- such as Verite Cachee -- picks up the story. Then relevant social media accounts begin sharing the story at more or less the same time. The fake stories then spread like wildfire as a result of the large numbers of followers that such X, Facebook, Telegram or TikTok accounts have.\n\nNevertheless, the claim might not be entirely baseless. The Pandora Papers, published in 2021 by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists suggest that Zelenskyy is the owner of an offshore shell company and may have profited from a billion-dollar corruption scheme by Ukrainian oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky.",

        "title": "The Rising Sun: Japan's Strategic Re-Awakening and the Art of Balance in the Indo-Pacific - The Geopolitics",
        "body": "Japan's recent pivot towards a robust defense posture and its longstanding economic prowess in East Asia present a paradigm shift. Japan's defense budget for 2021 was approximately 5.34 trillion yen ($48.56 billion), marking a continuous increase for the ninth consecutive year and setting a new record for the country. This evolution is not merely a reaction to the contemporary crescendo of tensions but a thoughtful, deliberate stride informed by a rich historical consciousness and a profound philosophical underpinning. More specifically, the Japanese government, in its 2020 Defense White Paper, explicitly identified China as a significant strategic challenge, underscoring the escalating tensions in the East China Sea, especially around the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands. Hence, the unveiling of Japan's new defense strategy by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida marks a pivotal moment, symbolizing a nation ready to navigate the delicate balance between its pacifist constitution and the exigencies of an increasingly precarious international landscape.\n\nA New Zero From the Rising Sun\n\nJapan's decision to bolster its military capabilities, with a significant investment in U.S.-made Tomahawk cruise missiles, represents a recalibration of its strategic posture. Critics argue this move contravenes the pacifist ethos enshrined in Japan's post-war constitution, yet it reflects a deeper, existential deliberation about national security and sovereignty. This strategic augmentation, positioning Japan as the third-largest military spender globally, is not merely an accumulation of martial prowess but a statement of intent and a redefinition of Japan's role on the world stage.\n\nEchoes of Past Imperialism\n\nThe critique from regional adversaries like North Korea, Russia, and China, although steeped in historical grievances, underscores the transformative potential of Japan's new trajectory. China's response, in particular, highlights the dialectic of power and perception in regional geopolitics, framing Japan's military enhancement as a deviation from a peaceful path. Yet, this narrative belies a more complex reality of a region in flux, where economic influence, strategic partnerships, and military deterrence are intricately intertwined. For example, it was the specter of the Ukrainian crisis that crystallized Japan's resolve, serving as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities inherent in the existing world order. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, in various statements, has drawn parallels between the situation in Ukraine and potential future conflicts in Asia, suggesting that Japan views the Ukrainian crisis as a cautionary tale for its security planning (Nikkei Asia, 2021). The notion that Ukraine's today could be Asia's tomorrow has spurred Tokyo into action, catalyzing a reevaluation of its defense doctrine. This recalibration towards a more proactive defense posture is infused with the wisdom of Japanese philosophy, acknowledging that true strength lies not just in the ability to defend but to deter.\n\nA Velvet Gloving Gripping the Samurai\n\nJapan's economic influence in Southeast Asia is a testament to its soft power and strategic foresight. Japan's commitment to infrastructure development in Southeast Asia is evident through its leading role in projects like the Jakarta Mass Rapid Transit system in Indonesia and the North-South Commuter Railway in the Philippines, totaling investments that significantly surpass those of China's Belt and Road Initiative in the region (Asian Development Bank, 2020). As such, Japan has cultivated a sphere of influence that extends beyond mere economic transactions.\n\nThe Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has been pivotal in providing low-interest loans for infrastructure projects across Southeast Asia, emphasizing Japan's approach to win goodwill and influence through economic means rather than coercive debt practices often associated with China's investments (JICA Annual Report, 2020). This approach, characterized by favorable loan terms and a respect for sovereignty, are not just investments in the future prosperity of Southeast Asia but also in the stability and security of the Indo-Pacific region and stands in stark contrast to the debt-laden overtures often associated with Chinese projects.\n\nBushido in Diplomacy\n\nThe philosophical underpinnings of Japan's strategic pivot can be traced to the nuanced legacy of Bushido, the way of the warrior. This ethos, characterized by honor, loyalty, and courage, informs Japan's approach to leadership and responsibility on the international stage. The transition from a pacifist posture to a proactive defense strategy reflects a broader societal acknowledgment of the changing dynamics of global power and the imperatives of national security. Japan's pivot to a more assertive defense posture while maintaining its pacifist principles illustrates the application of Bushido's values in contemporary geopolitical strategy.\n\nThe Rising Sun Rising Again\n\nJapan's significant investments in defense, infrastructure, and technological innovation are part of its broader vision to play a more proactive role in ensuring regional stability. Initiatives like the Quad (Quadrilateral Security Dialogue) involving Japan, the United States, India, and Australia, exemplify Japan's commitment to contributing to a stable and secure Indo-Pacific region (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan, 2021).\n\nAs Japan navigates this strategic evolution, it does so with an acute awareness of its historical legacies and the contemporary challenges that shape the Indo-Pacific landscape. The investment in defense, infrastructure, and technological innovation is indicative of a nation that seeks to redefine its role, not as a mere participant in the international system but as a pivotal architect of a more balanced, stable, and prosperous regional order.\n\nThis strategic re-awakening, while fraught with obstacles, is informed by the lessons of living history, the imperatives of the eternal present, and the possibilities of a self-made future. As Japan continues to shape its path, it does so with the grace of the samurai, the foresight of the strategist, and the commitment of a nation poised to play a defining role in the Indo-Pacific theater. The rising sun, emblematic of Japan's national flag, thus symbolizes not just the dawn of a new day but the emergence of a new paradigm in the delicate dance of power, principle, and peace in the 21st century.\n\n[Photo by 海上自衛隊, via Wikimedia Commons]",

        "title": "Reimagining Russian Warfare: The Transformation in the Ukraine Conflict - The Geopolitics",
        "body": "In the crucible of the Ukraine conflict, Russian forces have embarked on a radical transformation of their armored warfare strategies. This evolution, epitomized by the emergence of advanced infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) and the so-called \"turtle tanks,\" reveals a broader strategic shift and underscores Russia's commitment to maintaining its military edge in an increasingly drone-dominated battlefield.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has entered a potentially perilous phase as Russia deploys a new generation of IFVs to the front lines. The BMP-3 and BMD-4M are not mere troop carriers; they represent the pinnacle of modern military engineering, bristling with firepower, agility, and robust armor designed to shield soldiers on the battlefield. Their introduction signals a profound shift in Russia's military strategy, raising concerns of further escalation in an already devastating conflict.\n\nIn tandem with this deployment, there has been a notable 20% increase in BMP-3 production by Kurganmashzavod, a powerhouse in Russia's defense industry. This translates to Russian forces receiving 50% more of these vehicles in 2024 compared to the previous year, highlighting the resilience of Russia's domestic military production despite severe international sanctions. The question arises: what capabilities do these new IFVs bring to the fight, and what are the potential consequences of their deployment on the battlefield?\n\nThe BMP-3 and BMD-4M are the backbone of Russia's mechanized infantry. To grasp their significance, one must understand the Soviet military doctrine that shaped their development. Post-World War II, the Soviet Red Army emphasized heavily armored formations capable of breaching enemy lines. This philosophy extended to their infantry fighting vehicles. The BMP-1, for example, was armed but vulnerable, sitting tall and unable to swim, making it an easy target.\n\nThe BMP-3, introduced in the 1980s, addressed these shortcomings with a design capable of conquering both water and mountainous terrain. It boasts a formidable 100mm main gun capable of firing high-explosive shells and anti-tank missiles, making it versatile enough to handle enemy troops, fortified positions, and tanks. Additionally, a 30mm autocannon and a coaxial 7.62mm machine gun provide a barrage of firepower against lighter targets and helicopters. The BMP-3's adaptability extends to its mobility with water jets for amphibious operations and a sophisticated suspension system for navigating rough terrain.\n\nThe BMD-4M, in contrast, traces its lineage to the Cold War's emphasis on airborne assaults. Designed to be lightweight and maneuverable, it can be parachuted into combat zones and dominate the battlefield once deployed. The BMD-4M retains the BMP-3's powerful armament but is enhanced with improved fire control systems for greater precision. It also features anti-tank guided missiles, offering substantial armor-piercing capabilities. Its lightweight design includes an NBC (nuclear, biological, chemical) protection system, safeguarding the crew from various threats.\n\nDespite their advanced design, the brutal realities of the Ukrainian conflict have tested these vehicles under harsh conditions. They have proven vulnerable to sophisticated anti-tank weapons and drone tactics employed by Ukrainian forces. In response, Russia's Kurganmashzavod is rapidly deploying upgraded versions of these IFVs to the front lines. Recent modifications include bar armor on the sides and cage structures over the turrets to deflect RPGs and drone-mounted explosives, enhancing their survivability.\n\nThese upgrades are complemented by the Nakidka thermal camouflage system, which reduces the vehicle's thermal signature, making it harder for enemy forces to detect. Additionally, the RP-377VM1L jamming system disrupts the communication between drones and their operators, potentially neutralizing drone threats. While these enhancements represent significant advancements, their real-world effectiveness remains to be fully tested.\n\nIn a fascinating adaptation to modern warfare, Russian forces have also introduced \"turtle tanks\" -- a peculiar yet effective response to the increasing threat posed by Ukrainian FPV drones. Initially, these tanks were local improvisations characterized by makeshift counter-FPV drone shelters fabricated from available materials. Early iterations featured simple metal sheets hastily affixed to the tanks, creating an armored shell designed to protect against drone attacks. Despite their rudimentary appearance, these modifications have proven remarkably effective in the field.\n\nFootage from late April captured a Russian armored assault near Krashna Harfa, showcasing a column of infantry fighting vehicles equipped with these counter-FPV shelters. The lead tank, protected by a cope cage, spearheaded the assault, effectively clearing mines with its plow before retreating to safety. This tactic underscores the tanks' dual role: mine clearance and providing cover for advancing units.\n\nBy early May, the design of turtle tanks had further evolved. Images from UAVs revealed T-62 tanks with hybrid shelters, combining chain link, grating, and reactive armor. These modifications illustrate a blurring of the lines between traditional cope cages and the new turtle shells. The incorporation of electronic warfare (EW) modules and mine plows underscores a comprehensive approach to battlefield threats.\n\nDespite these innovations, the turtle tanks are not invulnerable. Videos from May showed several instances of these tanks being damaged or destroyed by mines and FPV drone attacks. One particularly striking example involved a turtle tank immobilized by a mine, subsequently attacked by multiple FPV drones. This highlights a significant vulnerability: while the shells offer protection, they are not foolproof against concentrated attacks.\n\nThe proliferation of turtle tanks across various Russian units, including the 40th Naval Infantry Brigade, indicates a decentralized yet widespread adoption of this concept. This suggests that the Russian military recognizes the value of these modifications and is willing to experiment with different designs to enhance their effectiveness.\n\nHowever, the reliance on makeshift solutions also points to a potential weakness: the lack of a unified, centrally coordinated approach to countering drone threats. As the conflict continues, it is likely that both Russian and Ukrainian forces will continue to adapt their tactics, leading to an ongoing cycle of measure and countermeasure.\n\nThe introduction of these upgraded IFVs represents a double-edged sword. The additional armor and jamming systems provide critical defense against drone strikes and RPG attacks. However, their impact on the war's trajectory is uncertain. Ukrainian forces are likely to adapt their tactics, and these upgrades will not transform these IFVs into invincible war machines. Nonetheless, the improvements may offer enhanced protection for Russian troops, potentially reducing casualties and enabling more aggressive maneuvers.\n\nIn the evolving theater of modern warfare, the significance of drones has grown exponentially, transforming battle strategies and posing unprecedented challenges to traditional armored vehicles. Recognizing this paradigm shift, Russia has embarked on an ambitious project to revolutionize its military hardware, particularly its iconic T-90 series tanks, to counter the ever-increasing threat of drone warfare.\n\nThe T-90 series, a cornerstone of Russian military might, has undergone significant transformations to maintain its dominance on the battlefield. The latest iteration, the T-90M \"Proryv-3,\" showcases remarkable advancements in armor, firepower, and electronic warfare capabilities. This state-of-the-art tank is designed to adapt to the rapidly changing dynamics of modern conflict, where drones play a pivotal role in reconnaissance, surveillance, and offensive operations.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin himself has lauded the T-90M as the world's premier battle tank, a sentiment echoed by Russian state media following its deployment in Ukraine in late December 2022. This deployment marked a critical moment in Russia's military strategy, as the T-90M began to engage in active combat against sophisticated adversaries equipped with advanced anti-tank systems and precision-guided munitions.\n\nA recent photo circulating on Russian social media has captured the attention of military analysts worldwide. It depicts a T-90M tank fitted with a new anti-drone armor system, a significant departure from the previously seen \"cope cages\" on the tank's turret. This upgrade features symmetrical armor plates on either side of the turret, a design aimed at enhancing the tank's resilience against drone strikes.\n\nThese modifications are not merely cosmetic; they represent a meticulously engineered response to the growing prevalence of FPV (First-Person View) drones. The new armor plates, positioned approximately 20 inches above the main armor, provide a robust shield against aerial attacks targeting the tank's turret. Additionally, the installation of a jammer on the turret's rear, protected by another armor plate, further strengthens the tank's defenses against drone-delivered ordnance.\n\nThe enhanced armor of the T-90M is a testament to Russia's commitment to staying ahead in the drone warfare game. These upgrades are tailored to mitigate the specific threats posed by drones, which have become a persistent challenge on the modern battlefield. However, the threat landscape is multifaceted. While these enhancements improve the tank's survivability against drones, they do not fully eliminate the risks posed by advanced anti-tank weapons such as the FGM-148 Javelin or the Bonus and SMArt 155 submunitions.\n\nThe strategic importance of these upgrades cannot be overstated. By bolstering the T-90M's armor and integrating advanced electronic countermeasures, Russia aims to enhance the tank's operational effectiveness and longevity in combat. The new design also ensures comprehensive protection for critical components such as the engine and transmission, further safeguarding the tank's mobility and functionality.\n\nDespite these advancements, the real-world efficacy of these upgrades remains to be thoroughly tested in active combat scenarios. The success of the T-90M's new armor system will depend on its ability to withstand the multifaceted threats it faces, from drone strikes to advanced anti-tank missiles. Military analysts speculate that these modifications represent the initial phase of a broader strategy to modernize Russia's armored fleet, with the potential for similar enhancements to be applied to other tanks, such as the T-72B3, in the near future.\n\nThe transformation of Russian armored tactics in the Ukraine war, exemplified by the development and deployment of turtle tanks and advanced IFVs, reflects a broader trend towards improvisation and rapid adaptation on the modern battlefield. These innovations, while effective to a degree, also expose new vulnerabilities and challenges. As both sides continue to evolve their strategies, the lessons learned from these adaptations will likely influence armored warfare tactics for years to come.\n\nThe BMP-3 and BMD-4M's upgrades are a clear indication that Russia is acutely aware of the changing dynamics of warfare and is taking proactive steps to ensure its armored vehicles remain formidable adversaries in the face of new and emerging threats. As the conflict in Ukraine continues to evolve, the effectiveness and impact of these formidable machines will undoubtedly play a crucial role in shaping its outcome.\n\n[Representational image, by Vitaly V.

        "title": "Fluctuating Relations: What Are the Current Dynamics Between Poland and the EU? - The Geopolitics",
        "body": "Poland is the most important EU member state in Eastern Europe and plays a pivotal role in the EU's foreign policy dynamics. Joining the EU in 2004 was a crucial moment in the European integration process that marked the country's commitment to democracy, market economy, and collective security. However, its foreign policy journey has not always been smooth, reflected in the tension between aspirations for national sovereignty and engagement in the much deeper process of EU integration.\n\nOver the past few decades, Poland has faced a series of challenges that have affected its foreign policy outlook and implementation at the EU level. One of the most contentious issues in Polish domestic politics and its relations with the EU is the migration crisis. In June 2023, the EU finally passed the reformed Immigration and Asylum Seekers Law after a long delay. The Immigration and Asylum Act was agreed to share the burden of refugees fairly between member states. Poland refused to agree to this due to its skepticism of EU migration quotas, which it sees as a threat to national sovereignty and social stability. Around one million immigrants from Ukraine have voluntarily settled in Poland since the beginning of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but if Poland agrees to the refugee burden, it will only add more social and security problems to Poland's already alarming population due to the lack of birthrates and a dwindling working-age population using immigrant labor due to the labor crisis.\n\nThis step taken by Poland is not only in its national interest but is also supported by other actors within the European Union itself. The Visegrad Group, comprising Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, formed in 1991 as a regional forum to accelerate integration into the European Union, has been transformed into a political alliance that addresses economic and security issues, particularly migration policy. As part of this group, Poland maintains its cultural identity and regional security by changing its immigration policy which tends to pay more attention to cultural identity but still adapts to global demands. In this sense, Poland's policy changes reflect the complex dynamics involving interactions with neighboring countries and perspectives within the Visegrad group.\n\nMoreover, in 2021, the narrative of \"Polexit\" or Poland's exit from the European Union also emerged, which became a controversial issue in Polish politics. Although no concrete steps have been taken in this direction, speculation about the possibility of Poland leaving the EU has reflected domestic political uncertainty and its potential impact on regional stability. Polexit has also reflected some Poles' resentment of EU policies that are perceived as intervening too far in domestic affairs, especially in sensitive issues such as the judicial system, rule of law, and media freedom.\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine war also highlighted Poland's important role in Eastern European security. As a country that shares a border with Ukraine, Poland has been a pioneer in supporting sanctions against Russia and strengthening NATO's military presence in the region. Poland's response to Russian aggression also emphasizes the country's importance as a key ally in maintaining stability in Eastern Europe.\n\nHowever, Poland also faces major challenges in terms of democratic values and civil liberties at home. Issues such as the judicial system, rule of law, and media freedom have raised serious concerns at the EU and international levels. The Polish government under the Prawo i Sprawiedliwość (PiS) or Right-Wing Party of Poland passed laws that threatened the independence of judicial institutions and restricted media freedom, drawing criticism from various quarters that questioned Poland's commitment to the fundamental principles of the European Union.\n\nDespite these fluctuations in relations between Poland and the EU, Poland has an opportunity to play a strategic role in supporting Eastern European integration. This would not only strengthen Poland's position within the EU but also help realize a more robust and unified vision for European integration as a whole. With this in mind, Poland's role in EU foreign policy is not just about navigating current challenges but also about taking the initiative to shape a more stable and integrated future for the EU as a whole. By addressing internal tensions and responding coherently to global challenges, Poland can play an important role in promoting security and stability in Europe.\n\nIf we try to keep looking ahead, Poland's engagement in the EU will continue to be tested by complex domestic political dynamics and the demands of adapting to an increasingly changing security environment in Europe. Polexit, as a controversial issue, reflects not only the divisions in Polish politics but also its potential impact on the stability and strength of the EU as a whole. Therefore, the challenges and opportunities faced by Poland in EU foreign policy cannot be separated from the discussion about the future of European integration and Poland's role within it.\n\n[Photo by Kpalion, via Wikimedia Commons]",

        "title": "An overview of the French elections | Explained",
        "body": "The story so far:\n\nThe first phase of the French elections conducted on June 30, after President Emmanuel Macron's sudden decision to dissolve parliament, has placed the far-right National Rally (RN) and its allies in the lead with a 33% vote share. The New Popular Front, a left-wing coalition, came second with 28%, while Mr. Macron's centrist bloc got only 20.7% of the vote share. The second phase will be held on July 7.\n\nWhy elections now?\n\nOn June 9, Mr. Macron stated that he was dissolving parliament, three years too soon, observing that \"France needs a clear majority if it is to act in serenity and harmony\". This announcement came after his bloc's devastating defeat at the hands of the RN in the European Parliament elections. While the decision came as a shock to most of his party members and allies, Marine Le Pen, the RN leader, welcomed the decision, claiming, \"we're ready for it\".\n\nExperts say Mr. Macron's decision was an attempt to stop the rise of the RN. His gamble was that the French public, faced with the choice of having a far-right party in power, would consolidate against the right-wing wave. However, if that was indeed the reasoning, it seems as if Mr. Macron placed the wrong bet. Almost all opinion polls by major outlets were predicting a lead for the RN (but short of an absolute majority), while Mr. Macron's approval ratings hit rock-bottom to 36%, according to a Toluna-Harris Interactive poll.\n\nThe sudden call for elections and the high stakes involved in the race has energised the electorate, with the Interior Ministry stating that 59.4% of registered voters had cast a ballot as of 5 p.m. on June 30, as compared to the 39.4% at the same time two years ago.\n\nHow are elections in France conducted?\n\nThere are 577 seats in the French parliament, which include 13 overseas districts and 11 constituencies that represent French citizens abroad. So to hold an absolute majority in parliament, a party needs 289 seats.\n\nThe first phase of the elections is equivalent to a qualifying round wherein candidates must at least get 12.5% of locally registered votes in order to stay in the race and not get eliminated. If a candidate gets more than half of the total votes cast in the first round itself, they will automatically win. If not, candidates who have met the qualifying criteria will move on to the second phase. At this stage of the elections, 'horse-trading' is a common practice wherein parties form blocs among themselves and drop candidates in constituencies which may split the vote and favour a rival party/alliance.\n\nThe 2024 snap elections are mainly a three-way battle between the RN and its allies, the New Popular Front, the left-wing coalition which include the Socialists, the Greens, the Communists and France Unbowed, and Ensemble, which is Mr. Macron's bloc.\n\nWhat is at stake?\n\nThe RN, founded as the National Front (FN), was established by Ms. Le Pen's father, Jean Marie Le Pen. The FN was an offshoot of a fascist organisation created as a reaction against the Algerian war, the formation of the Fifth French republic and the protests of May 1968 in France. However, under Ms. Le Pen, the party has undergone a significant rebranding wherein she has sought to whitewash the party's fascist roots as well as her father's Holocaust denial and anti-Semitism. By changing the name of the party from FN to RN, Ms. Le Pen also softened the organisation's once hardcore policies such as leaving the EU and opting out of the euro, the region's currency. Additionally, ever since the Russia-Ukraine war and the subsequent energy crisis, the party has actively distanced itself from Russian President Vladimir Putin with whom Ms. Le Pen once kept close ties.\n\nHowever, in other aspects, the RN is as far-right as it always was. The policy of 'national priority', which the RN espouses, gives French citizens the first choice when it comes to social housing, employment and social benefits -- a scheme which goes against the French Constitution. Similarly, the RN is completely opposed to immigration. It calls for the deportation of all 'illegal' immigrants and strict border controls, and characterises immigrants as destroying the 'European way of life'. The party has also promised to abolish citizenship by birth to children born to parents of foreign descent.\n\nThus, the RN has risen to popularity within the French republic due to fears of culture clashes, a cost-of-living crisis and Mr. Macron's unpopular policies such as increasing the age of retirement. It increased its seat share in the French parliament from seven to 89 in 2022 and now hopes for it to jump as high as anywhere between 240 to 300 seats. Moreover, the party has also been able to tap into the electorate in the provincial towns and villages of southern France, mostly composed of blue-collar workers who have often felt neglected by the political elites of Paris.\n\nMr. Macron's political gamble could potentially lead to France being ruled by a far-right party for the first time since the end of the Second World War. Already there have been reports of a rise in racist attacks, along with anti-far-right protests in many parts of Paris on June 30, some of which ended in violence and arson. The political uncertainty has stoked fear in immigrants and minority communities, particularly among Muslim groups who have often been attacked by the RN.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAs the date for registering the final list of candidates who will be contesting from various constituencies is over, more than 200 candidates from the centre and left alliances have dropped out of the race in order to consolidate votes against the RN.\n\nThe sudden formation of the New Popular front (a reference to the 1936 Popular Front where Socialists and Communists allied against far-right rioters), is part of a practice known as the \"republican front\", wherein centrist and left parties' team up to keep right-wing parties out of power. However, whether the 'front' will hold this time is questionable, especially considering the presence of leftist leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a controversial figure who was accused of anti-Semitism by his rivals.\n\nThe president of the RN and its Prime Ministerial candidate, Jordan Bardella, has stated that he won't enter into an alliance with any of the other blocs. He said he didn't want to be the \"President's assistant\" and that he would rather be a 'cohabitation Prime Minister' as accorded by the French Constitution. A cohabitation is where the President is part of one party and Parliament is ruled by a party not of the President's. Here, domestic policy is governed by the Prime Minister and his Cabinet while defence and foreign policy are handled by the President's office. Mr. Bardella, like his patron Ms. Le Pen, promises that he would prioritise French citizens and bring more purchasing power into their hands by reducing VAT on essential products such as fuel, food, etc.\n\nThe last time a snap election was called was in 1997, when centre-right President Jacques Chirac dissolved the National Assembly to consolidate his party's dominance after a slew of unpopular policies surrounding fiscal austerity. However, his gamble backfired as a new left-wing government came to power inadvertently entering him into a cohabitation alliance. By next week, one would know whether Mr. Macron's decision will also go the same way, and whether his party will be, as Ms. Le Pen stated, \"wiped out\" by the RN.\n\nRead Comments",

        "body": "New multi-country polling report reports sustained public support for the delivery of weapons and ammunition to Ukraine, but shows divisions on how the war will end - and the purpose of European aid.\n\nIt is published by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) on Wednesday, just ahead of the 2024 NATO Summit.\n\nIt suggests NATO leaders are unlikely to find domestic backing for troop deployments or increases in defence spending to assist the war effort.\n\nFollowing the dramatic delay of a critical US support package for Ukraine earlier this year, a political shift in Europe towards populist parties of the far-right, and the recent intensification of Russian military attacks against critical infrastructure in Ukraine, the report found that there has been no discernible collapse of morale in Ukraine or change in support for the Ukrainian war effort among its European allies.\n\nIt reveals, almost two and half years into Russia's invasion of the country, that a majority of Ukrainians (58%) believe they can secure a battlefield victory, and that confidence in the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the country's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, remains high. However, there are major divisions in Ukraine when it comes to prospective trade-offs that could bring an end to the conflict.\n\nThe study's authors and foreign policy experts, Ivan Krastev and Mark Leonard, believe looming divergences of opinion between European and Ukrainian publics could make finding agreement on how the war should end extremely challenging - and have significant impacts on Kyiv's pathway to NATO and EU accession.\n\nLeonard, co-author and founding director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, told this site: \"Our new polling suggests that one of the key challenges for Western leaders will be reconciling the conflicting positions between Europeans and Ukrainians on how the war will end. While both groups recognise the need for continued military provision, to help Ukraine push back at Russian aggression, there is a profound gulf around what constitutes a victory - and what the purpose of Europe's support actually is.\n\n\"While Europeans predominantly see a negotiated settlement as the most likely outcome, Ukrainians are not yet ready to countenance territorial trade-offs for NATO accession, nor engage with the idea of 'Finlandisation', in which they would keep their territory but forgo their EU and NATO ambitions.\"\n\nThe report is based on a public opinion poll of adult populations (aged 18 and over) conducted in May 2024 in 15 countries (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, Poland, Portugal, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and Ukraine). The total number of respondents was 19,566.\n\nThe poll was conducted online by Datapraxis and YouGov in the Czech Republic (9-16 May, 1,071 respondents), France (9-20 May, 1,502),Germany (9-17 May, 2,026), Great Britain (9-13 May, 2,082), Greece (1-16 May, 1,093), Italy (9-17 May, 1,036), Poland (9-23 May, 1,550), Portugal (9-20 May, 1,070), the Netherlands (9-15 May, 1,014), Spain (9-17 May, 1,508), Sweden (9-23 May, 1,026), and Switzerland (2-15 May, 1,079).",

        "summary": "A new report by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) reveals sustained public support in Europe for supplying weapons to Ukraine, but highlights divisions on how the war should end and the purpose of European aid. Published ahead of the 2024 NATO Summit, the report suggests NATO leaders may struggle to gain domestic support for troop deployments or increased defense spending. Despite recent political shifts in Europe and intensified Russian attacks, Ukrainian morale and support from European allies remain strong. The report, based on a May 2024 poll of 19,566 adults across 15 countries, shows that 58% of Ukrainians believe in a battlefield victory and maintain high confidence in President Zelenskyy and the Armed Forces. However, there are significant differences between European and Ukrainian views on ending the conflict, with Europeans favoring a negotiated settlement and Ukrainians rejecting territorial trade-offs for NATO accession. The findings indicate potential challenges for Western leaders in reconciling these conflicting positions, which could impact Ukraine's path to NATO and EU membership."

        "body": "A conservative writer argues that his country's rulers exhibit the vices of youth, not old age\n\nThe discombobulated performance that President Joe Biden gave at the first presidential debate on June 27th sent Democratic Party loyalists, and the journalists who staff the television stations they watch, into a state of shock. It shouldn't have.\n\nBiden's condition has been no mystery to those who work closely with him, nor to daily reporters who have had ever less access to his ever less frequent public appearances. His administration has been marked by malapropisms, confabulations and confusion. \"Incidents\" have multiplied of late - staring emptily amid a frenzy of gospel music and dancing on the White House lawn in mid-June, \"freezing\" on stage before being led off by former president Barack Obama at a Hollywood fundraiser. Indeed, the Biden who appeared before more than 50m Americans at the debate has been with us for quite some time.\n\nOne telling moment came at a February campaign rally in Las Vegas, as Biden tried to rouse the crowd with a story about a summit in Cornwall in 2021. \"Right after I was elected\", he began, \"I went to a 7 meeting in southern England. And I sat down and said, 'America is back!' and Mitterrand from Germany - I mean France - looked at me and said, 'How long you back for?'\" Biden might well have asked the same of François Mitterrand, president of France at the end of the cold war. After all, Mitterrand had been dead since 1996.\n\nA few days later, surprised by a question at a tightly controlled press conference, he seemed to confuse Egypt's Abdel Fattah al-Sisi with the president of Mexico. The press conference had been hastily called after a Justice Department report found that Biden had mishandled classified documents, a criminal offence. The prosecutor declined to press charges only because the president, whom he called \"a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory\", was someone no jury would think capable of committing a crime \"that requires a mental state of wilfulness\".\n\nIt would be natural under the circumstances for voters to ask some uncomfortable questions. If the president lacks the wilfulness to store a document properly, how would he find the power of concentration to manage a multi-front war, or the command of detail to balance a budget, or the common sense to know which foreign leaders to trust? Biden is the oldest president in American history, and the oldest candidate ever to stand for the office.\n\nVoters can throw him out, of course. But the gaffes of the debate bring a deeper problem into focus. Looming behind an adjacent podium that Thursday night was Donald Trump - at 78 years old the second oldest candidate ever to stand, and one to whom various other unflattering superlatives have been attached.\n\nWhat happened? Americans have come to realise that their country is no longer the youthful and forward-looking society it took itself for in the Clinton, Bush junior and Obama years. It is faced with a choice between two ancient and unpopular politicians, which increasingly feels like the only kind of leader America has. Until last year the country's most powerful legislative post, speaker of the House, was also held by its oldest-ever-occupant, 82-year-old Nancy Pelosi. Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell is 82 as well. The Republican delegation to the powerful Senate Budget Committee is led by 90-year-old Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who was elected during the Carter administration.\n\nSuch an elderly profile for the Senate is not wholly regrettable. The upper chamber is supposed to be a place of tradition, good manners and bipartisan comity - and voters tend to like it that way. Unfortunately the loudest and most social-media-savvy parts of the public are an exception. When Democratic senator Dianne Feinstein embraced Republican senator Lindsey Graham to congratulate him on a well-run confirmation hearing in 2020, her own party's Twitter activists demanded she leave the Senate. They got their wish last autumn when she died in office at the age of 90.\n\nWe have heard about \"gerontocracies\" - societies ruled by elders far past their prime, out of touch and yet untouchable, preserving a frozen system from some previous era. They make for pitiable scenes: China in the last confused years of Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai in the early 1970s; or the Soviet Union a decade later, ruled in turn by Leonid Brezhnev on his deathbed, Yuri Andropov on his dialysis machine, and Konstantin Chernenko struggling to catch his breath in public. China and the , of course, were dictatorships. Their leaders naturally resisted being replaced. But that's partly what makes it so alarming to see the United States failing to inject fresh blood into the body politic.\n\nMost societies have been inclined, or liable, to be ruled by older people. Up to a point this is common sense: the old, we assume, have experience and wisdom. The Roman senate that gives its name to ours derives from the word senex, or \"old man\". The Spartan senate was called the Gerousia - a name meaning \"council of elders\" that has occasionally been used by the Greek republic for its upper house, most recently in the 1920s and 1930s. Its members were called gerontes - again, \"old men\". In town government, our good English word alderman originally carried the sense of \"elder\" or \"patriarch\" or \"head of clan\". Lest we forget, the most important task for a state is survival, and an old person is someone who has managed that, at least.\n\nOld leaders have also been thought useful for reviving old ways, or preserving customs under threat. That's the role Konrad Adenauer - der Alte, \"the old man\" - played in post-war Germany for almost two decades. Already 68 years old when he emerged from a Nazi prison at the end of the second world war, Adenauer became chancellor at 73. \"No experiments!\" was one of his campaign slogans. His shell-shocked voters were grateful for the connection he represented to a Germany that had not known Nazism. So grateful, in fact, that they sent Adenauer to Bonn for three more terms as chancellor. In the early 1960s, when the Beatles were playing their first gigs in Hamburg, Germany was still being ruled by an octogenarian born 13 years before Hitler.\n\nSeniors are, admittedly, often short on vim and aggression, qualities that are indispensable to self-defence. But the hope is that this lack might be compensated by wisdom and a cool head. The inclination to violence that marks many men between adolescence and their early 30s can be an advantage in a martial era. But it isn't always, and whether in wartime or peacetime it should be allowed to subside before a leader takes the control of a nation with an army. Andrew Peabody, a Harvard clergyman and classicist from the age of the 19th-century railroad barons, described aged rulers' role as that of \"brakemen\" on the state's passions.\n\nSlower can be better. Journalists were hard on Ronald Reagan for napping daily (and occasionally even during meetings with dignitaries, most famously with Pope John Paul II in Rome in 1982). But ideally a president should not be sleep-deprived, working overtime, or simply too harried to take a bit of shuteye when he needs it. In his classic account of 19th-century central banking, \"Lombard Street\", Walter Bagehot claimed that we should celebrate - not resent - the unchallenging work by which bankers grow rich. Do you want your banker to be investing your savings in ventures so complicated that he must burn the midnight oil to manage them? Of course not. Such matters are too important. \"The business of banking ought to be simple,\" Bagehot wrote. \"If it is hard it is wrong.\" This is not to say that a lack of vigour is an asset - only that statesmanship conforms better than we usually think to an old man's energy level.\n\nAt the same time, the old are often free agents in a way young people cannot be. Plutarch, who considered envy \"the greatest evil attending the management of public affairs\", approved of old rulers on the grounds that they were less susceptible to it. The old can thus more easily form dynamic alliances. With most of their careers behind them, they are unlikely to be careerists. They can be reckless in the service of truth, at least as they see it - a vital quality in an age of speech codes and self-censorship.\n\nBut there is a darker view of having old people in power, which mirrors a dark view of old people more generally: they have lost touch with their fellow citizens. Joe Biden, for instance, is older than 97% of Americans. This threatens to be especially alienating in a time of rapid social and technological change, because old people tend to adapt poorly. Biden says \"ain't\" and \"y'all\" when he talks to black people, in what he seems to think is a sign of empathy. He addresses America's union workers as if they all still work on assembly lines in automobile plants, whereas today half of unionised workers are in the public sector, and many of those in the private sector are employed by government-adjacent companies: utilities, transport and education.\n\nA novelty of our age is that, since technology creates certain predictable problems (protecting privacy online, climate change, regulating drone traffic), a democracy can be divided into two classes of citizens. There are young ones, who will have to live with the consequences of a problem, and older ones, to whom that problem might be outright invisible. This has not been a failing of Biden's administration, which has designed, and muscled through Congress, vast government programmes meant to establish green-energy infrastructure and restore American competitiveness in microchip manufacturing. But even when it is politically competent, the domination of a country's politics by old people can be evidence of some deeper problem, some uncomfortable sociological reality that is disrupting the usual system of generational succession and blocking the rise of the young.\n\nThe Soviet gerontocracy of the early 1980s, for instance, was fallout from the Stalinist purges of the late 1930s. Brezhnev, Andropov and Chernenko had all, as young men, been among the communist cadres who proved themselves trustworthy - or at least managed to survive at a time when many of their colleagues wound up in the gulag or an early grave. The second world war introduced a crop of heroes whose claims on public loyalty had little to do with the party programme - Marshal Georgi Zhukov conspicuous among them. In most societies a genial soldier like Zhukov would be promoted. In Stalin's, he was considered a rival and marginalised. The pre-war generation circled the wagons, and by 1980, Russia was led by a doddering core born before the first world war. Andropov, the most original among them, decided Mikhail Gorbachev was a trustworthy enough Leninist to be introduced as a voting member of the Politburo, even if he was a raw youth of 49.\n\nThe United States owes its present leadership crisis to a similar generational logjam, albeit one with a different and more benign mechanism. The American baby boom, which lasted from 1946 to 1964, was larger than its European equivalents. By the early 1980s all its members were old enough to vote, and they made up roughly 40% of the country's electorate for decades. This made the baby-boomers politically invincible on any question where the generation had a strong preference. Their whims became laws. In the 1950s, the boomers' parents presided over a huge increase in the country's education budget, which, by the time the youngest boomers graduated, would see university enrolments quintuple.\n\nThe circumstances of the 1960s - in other words, luck - did a great deal to empower the boomers as a generation. They had nothing to do with devising the war in Vietnam, but they were the first to protest against it, and when discontent with the war became a majority sentiment, they wound up vindicated. When Watergate brought the resignation of President Richard Nixon and the landslide Democratic victory in the congressional elections of 1974, half a dozen baby-boomers, still in their 20s, entered Congress. The average age of America's representatives fell below 50 for the first time since the second world war.\n\nAlthough the baby-boomers seemed committed to personal liberation and self-exploration in the 1960s, over time they proved a relatively conservative generation. By the 1980s, they had rallied behind Ronald Reagan and money-making. In the 1990s, they backed the abolition of the tax on inheritances, just in time to collect theirs. These days they back the ruthless protection of full retirement benefits.\n\nAt every step of his career, Joe Biden, born four years before the baby boom began, has been in a position to benefit from demographic change. Just as he is the oldest president in American history, he was in 1972 elected as one of the youngest senators in American history, indeed younger than the constitutionally mandated minimum age of 30. (He was able to take office because his 30th birthday fell in the eight weeks between election day and the Senate's swearing-in.)\n\nHis advantage, and the advantage of politicians like him, has been consolidated by the emergence of an American plutocracy and the role it plays in a money-saturated political system. In the United States, the people who bankroll campaigns do not just want to advance a cause - they want a personal relationship with the politician they're backing. That explains why so much fundraising takes place at fairly intimate dinners.\n\nNow campaign-finance laws make it hard to transfer assets from one candidate to another. That is one reason why, after Biden's debate debacle, the howls of outrage from Democratic-leaning pundits about Biden's unsuitability as a candidate did not immediately bring constructive efforts to replace him. For a trust-fund activist or an oil mogul, an incumbent is an asset whose value must be protected deep into old age. And beyond, if possible: that is why the designation of offspring (such as George W. and Jeb Bush) and wives (such as Hillary Clinton and perhaps, some day, Michelle Obama) as successors has become acceptable, indeed preferable, among political powers-that-be. One can see why monarchy with familial succession is such a deep anthropological norm across societies - it gives those who have rallied behind a ruler the best chance of preserving their privileges.\n\nBaby-boomers made up only 30% of voters in the most recent midterm elections of 2022. Their unceremonious dismissal from the stage of American public life is surely not far away. Yet their power remains entrenched for now. Why might this be?\n\nReplacing leaders gets harder in a time of mass migration and inter-ethnic division. American voters always hesitate to pass the torch to the next generation; they may hesitate even more to pass the torch to a generation that includes newcomers from Latin America and Asia. Democrats are the party of migration and demographic change, trying to win an election at a time when Western voters are suspicious and even hostile to it - consider the recent elections across the European Union. Biden, with his half-century of Washington experience and middle-of-the-road demeanour, allows a dynamic party to reassure swing voters with a familiar face. When Donald Trump described Biden as \"Sleepy Joe\" in 2020, he may have been doing him a favour.\n\nGerontocracies, as noted, often aspire to lock an entire lost political order in place. If we thought of Biden as a gerontocrat, we would see his elevation as an attempt to revive the New Deal culture - a nation of traditional working-father-and-homemaking-mother families earning their livings in factories and on farms - that the party has jettisoned in recent decades, along with the working class that built its lives around it.\n\nBut that is not what is happening now. In the last election Democrats cobbled together a dynamic and fractious alliance of interest groups - single women, gays, government employees, tech entrepreneurs - committed to defeating Donald Trump. They had done this before, in the Obama-era bloc that the journalist Ronald Brownstein called the \"coalition of the ascendant\". But beyond their ascendance, these interest groups still don't have much in common, and in 2020 they had to come together during a summer of protests and riots over race and policing.\n\nAt the time, Biden was not particularly popular among Democratic primary voters. But he provided an image of continuity for a government of discontinuity and promised to reconcile the different wings of his coalition. This reconciliation still proves elusive. Someone who marches for George Floyd might not be committed to arming Ukraine or subsidising green-energy billionaires or keeping abortion legal. The extent of the challenge is visible in its intra-party strife over Israel, as well as the colossal deficits Biden has found it necessary to run up in order to maintain unity. You don't keep a coalition like this together by saying \"no\".\n\nThe problems with Biden are not the traditional problems with gerontocrats - it's not that he's running things like an old man or snoozing through important decisions. It's that the detail-orientation and hyperactivity of his administration leave the impression that he isn't running things at all. Things are being run by some younger people, whom none of us voted for and whose names we perhaps don't even know.\n\nThe American system right now is something very different from a gerontocracy, even if it is being disguised as one. For a country undergoing tremendous stress and change, America is responding with surprising vigour (consider Trump's covid-vaccine programme or Biden's green-energy and tech subsidies) and surprising aggression (consider Biden's eagerness to turn the Russian war against Ukraine into a Western war against Russia).\n\nThat gives something of a logic to the weird face-off between the two candidates. Biden is an old-fashioned person with a progressive and in many ways radical agenda. Trump is delivering promises of a restoration, even if he is not a person who would be deemed worthy of the Oval Office in the America his voters would like him to restore. Whichever side one prefers, there is nothing sleepy or crepuscular about any of it. Immoderation, impetuosity, egotism: the vices of the present day are those not of age but of youth. ■",

The tabloid backed Labour.\n\n-- Rishi Sunak experienced an insane meeting of minds on \"This Morning.\" And revealed his on-brand favorite meal.\n\n**A message from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation: Between 2000 and 2020 Gavi protected one billion children from vaccine-preventable diseases. With the UK's support, we can make our world safer by protecting more children against more diseases, faster than ever before.**\n\nTOP OF THE NEWSLIST\n\nIT'S THE FINAL COUNTDOWN: Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer are preparing to make their final pitches to voters ... with three seat-level polls in the past hour predicting an ever-worsening night for the Conservatives.\n\nFirst data point: The latest YouGov MRP poll dropped in the past few minutes showing an even worse result for the Conservatives than the pollster's previous research a couple of weeks ago. It predicts Labour winning 431 seats with the Tories on 102. That Conservative number is down from 108 in the previous YouGov MRP.\n\nThis is big: That would be a 212 majority for Keir Starmer -- the biggest Commons majority since 1832. The Lib Dems meanwhile are predicted to win 72 seats, the SNP 18 and Reform three.\n\nSecond data point: Another MRP poll for More in Common, in partnership with the News Agents podcast, predicts the Tories will win 126 seats and Labour 430 -- giving the new administration a majority of 210. That sounds like quite good news for the Tories in the current context ... until it's compared with the most recent More in Common MRP from two weeks ago, which predicted Sunak would end up with 155 seats and Labour 406.\n\nThe small print: There are 133 seats in the More in Common poll with majorities of less than 5 percent, meaning a last minute swing could well change the overall picture. And there are 52 seats effectively tied, including those of Conservative leadership hopeful Penny Mordaunt against Labour in Portsmouth North and Labour frontbencher Thangam Debbonaire against the Greens in Bristol Central.\n\nExtras: The Lib Dems are set to win more than 50 seats, More in Common reckons, while the SNP is set to fall below 20. The pollster also predicts former Labour boss Jeremy Corbyn will win his Islington North seat, while Nigel Farage and Lee Anderson are set to win their respective Clacton and Ashfield targets for Reform. Full map here.\n\nThird data point: The Conservatives have dropped a further two seats since last week in the latest MRP for Focaldata, also released this afternoon. The poll puts the Labour on 444 seats (down six on last week) and the Tories on 108, meaning a 238 majority for Starmer and co. The Lib Dems are the main beneficiaries of the shifting sands, up seven seats on 57, while the Reform has doubled its expectations in a week ... to two seats.\n\nAnd there's more: There have been a whole bunch of voting intention polls in the past few hours too (those boring old normal polls we used to get excited about before the MRP bubble came along) predicting nothing less than a 17-point Labour lead.\n\nOnwards to (not) victory! Sunak will nevertheless keep his duracell rabbit vibe going to the bitter end, hosting a rally at 8 p.m. tonight in Hampshire. Expect warnings about tax rises, supermajorities, increased legal and illegal migration and all the other things that are horrible when it's not the Tories doing them.\n\nSupermajorities latest: Minister for the broadcast studios Mel Stride told Times Radio this morning Britain looks to be on the brink of \"the largest landslide we will have ever seen,\" urging voters to consider \"supporting the Conservative Party so we can hold this government to account going forward.\" Quite the line less than 24 hours before polls open.\n\nMixed messages: Appearing on \"This Morning,\" erm, this morning, Sunak said Stride wasn't conceding defeat. The PM insisted he was \"fighting hard for every vote\" and that a few more ballots in the right places \"can make the difference in this election.\" Easier said than done.\n\nStill not giving up, honest: And in an interview with PA which landed in the last few minutes, the PM said he wasn't willing to reflect on his time in office while the election was ongoing. \"As long as I can look myself in the mirror and know that I am working as hard as I can, doing what I believe is right for the country, that is how I get through,\" he said.\n\nDon't believe the hype: Speaking to broadcasters during a campain event in Wales, Starmer said the Stride line was an effort in \"voter suppression,\" adding : \"It's trying to get people to stay at home rather than go out and vote.\" He said something or other about people who want change needing to vote for it.\n\nNot bovverd: Starmer also told hacks Boris Johnson materializing on the campaign trail like a mirage in the dessert last night wasn't a concern. \"Having argued for six weeks that they're chaotic and divided, to bring out exhibit A, with 24 hours to go, just vindicated the argument I've been making,\" he said. Steven Swinford has the behind-the-scenes on how Sunak talked BoJo into a campaign appearance.\n\nNot to mention: Playbook PM remembers when BoJo was opening for all the final stump speeches Theresa May did in the 2017 election. And we all know how that ended. Even BoJo's dad ain't following his advice.\n\nLast Starmer stump: The Labour leader is expected to appear at a rally in Worcestershire at around 8 p.m. too.\n\nMaking platforms for Nigel: Reform boss Nigel Farage will be doing his Donald Trump impressions at Clacton Pier from 6 p.m. for his last hurrah of the campaign. He's done his final campaign interview with Chris Hope of GB News (who else?) which should appear on the broadcaster around 7 p.m. Farage faced further accusations of hanging out with wrong 'uns this afternoon.\n\nOn the Ed one last time: Lib Dem boss Ed Davey has been in Hertfordshire with his second-in-command Daisy Cooper. He drove a tractor earlier with \"he who dares wins\" printed on it -- the line Michael Gove is said to have delivered to Cabinet when Rishi Sunak called the election. There's no doubt Davey has proved he has more daring balls than Gove during this campaign. Not least because Gove didn't even dare stand.\n\nBack to the polls: While readers wait for those final campaign pitches, there has been shed loads more polling out since this morning, which is as good a form of entertainment as any -- including various interesting side-insights exclusive to Playbook PM.\n\nConservative Hail Mary pass: A good chunk of undecided voters could return to the Tories in vital seats, making the difference between election defeat and total wipeout, per new research by JL Partners shared with Playbook PM. Nine percent of voters in safe-ish Conservative seats are still undecided (slightly higher than in seats overall) and almost two-thirds of these undecideds voted Conservative in 2019.\n\nCold comfort: There are signs these late deciders are not yet ready to switch allegiance. Rishi Sunak's approval rating is at net -5 among this group and has improved over the campaign, compared with a score of -34 for Keir Starmer. Promising stuff for the Tories.\n\nHowever: Another More in Common poll for the New Britain Project think tank and shared with Playbook PM showed Labour ahead of the Tories (and Reform) on various crucial metrics, such as having a long-term vision for Britain, competence, fixing problems, being stable and being good in a crisis.\n\nAnd to make matters even worse ... more than a quarter of voters are planning to cast their ballot tactically, acording to research from Savanta for the Electoral Reform Society and shared with Playbook PM. That's up three points since the questin was asked at the start of the campaign. But (and this is quite the but) it's lower than at the same point before the 2019 election, when intention to vote tactically was at 30 percent. Would it be a huge surprise if all the noise about tactical voting comes to nothing again?\n\nStill want more polling? More in Common boss Luke Tryl will be discussing his latest MRP data with UCL in a 6 p.m. webinar. Details here.\n\nPolling product warning: It's well worth reading this thread from Savanta's Chris Hopkins, which does lots of important expectation management and tries to un-spin the inevitable spin from the parties once the actual results become clear.\n\nDRIVETIME DEBRIEF\n\nIT HAPPENED: The Sun backed Labour! The right-wing tabloid was never gonna be on the losing side, right? Its leader article for tomorrow says the Tories are \"exhausted\" after endless chaos.

She told the Telegraph she agreed with Sunak that sandwiches are the best meal. \"I'm totally with him on sandwiches being the best,\" she told the paper. \"My favorite is bacon, lettuce and tomato.\" She added: \"Rishi Sunak was gorgeous, he had beautiful skin, lovely eyes and teeth -- I'd love to give him a good sandwich.\" No prizes for guessing what she'd like to do with his beautiful skin.\n\nAnd there's more: \"I'm not into politics whatsoever. I know I should care, but I don't,\" Holt said, speaking for most of Britain. \"I like the memes but other than that I have no interest.\"\n\nSeriously, this stuff keeps coming: Asked which party leader she would get tattooed on her body, she said she would get Sunak. \"I'd get a picture of his face and put a little caption saying 'when I was little I didn't get Sky TV,'\" she said.

Even traditionally Conservative supporters, like Boris Johnson's father and the Sun newspaper, are backing Labour. Sunak remains determined, hosting a rally in Hampshire, while Starmer campaigns in Worcestershire. The election's outcome could reshape British politics, with implications for party leadership and future governance."

        "body": "The lack of underground shelter space for protection during a nuclear conflict is prompting people to invest in private bunkers.\n\nThe \"scare factor\" from potential nuclear fallout, especially with the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, is a major reason why individuals are preparing for the worst, according to Charles Hardman, who runs the company Subterranean Spaces.\n\nSome of his clients include energy company directors, Middle Eastern royalty, and European car company owners.\n\nHe said that fear of nuclear conflict, especially due to the recent Russia-Ukraine war was a major reason for bunker purchases, though a desire to showcase wealth also played a role.\n\nHe said that very wealthy people wanted \"to tick the box\" with a Ferrari, an Aston Martin, a house in Europe, and a house in the UK.\n\nBut now, a nuclear bunker is \"something they can tick the box with,\" he said.\n\nMr. Hardman, who also has quite a lot of inquiries overseas, in Europe and Saudi Arabia, said that demand had \"plateaued\" in England, in part due to the fact that news coverage of the Ukraine war has dropped.\n\n\"The only reason people call up is if they get worried,\" he said.\n\n\"It's the wrong time; it's too late then. These things take eight to ten months to a year to build. People should be preparing now. The whole of Europe is getting them done,\" he added, citing Sweden, Switzerland, and Germany as examples.\n\nThough he warned that in the UK there's no preparation. \"There's nothing,\" he said.\n\n\"Israel has to have a safe room for every property. China and Russia have built vast bunkers for their populations, and yet, in the UK, they're like, 'No, we don't need bunkers,'\" he said.\n\nMr. Thompson's company fills a niche by building smaller, more affordable bunkers, ranging from £20,000 to £150,000.\n\n\"You tend to have people who build bunkers for billionaires and millionaires, some of these are extremely lavish, with cinemas and swimming pools. But that's not what the everyday person can afford,\" he said.\n\nThough he said that the growing interest due to increased awareness of potential conflicts.\n\n\"More and more people are waking up to the fact that we are basically marching towards World War Three between NATO and Russia,\" he said.\n\nNuclear war followed by climate change were people's biggest concerns.\n\n\"We had them in World War Two, Anderson shelters, of course, they made a couple of million, but they did save millions of lives,\" he said.\n\nHowever he explained that the difference between now and then is that the humble World War II Anderson shelter was designed to offer British householders an afternoon of protection during bomb raids.\n\nBut in a fallout shelter, where you must hide from potential radiation, people may need to stay for two weeks or longer. Therefore, it has to be comfortable to live in, with sleeping quarters, cooking facilities, washing and bathing amenities, and entertainment and games etc.\n\n\"We had fallout from Chernobyl land in Wales, and we still have to scan the sheep today for radiation,\" he said.\n\nMr. Thompson's wife, a trained psychologist, provides video content to help people cope during crises in a potential bunker situation.\n\nHe said that planning permission is growing and depends on \"what area you live in and who you are.\" However, some clients may wish to remain tight-lipped about such a project.\n\n\"Do you want to advertise your bunker? Because when it all goes wrong, they are going to be in your bunker -- and if you've only built one for your family you can't support half the neighbourhood,\" he said.",

        "title": "The dragnet approach to the EU individual sanctions regime is failing",
        "body": "Dr Moshe Kantor's case clearly demonstrates a cleanup of the list is long overdue. Those who deserve sanctions should remain, while those who were caught up in the overly tenacious initial compilation should be removed, Eldad Beck writes.\n\nSince the very beginning of the Russia-Ukraine war in February 2022, the European Union has taken many measures and posed sanctions against Russia and those deemed to be \"supporting, financing or implementing actions\" in the war effort.\n\nUnfortunately, in a hurried approach, some of the bureaucrats who put together the list and the criteria for applying personal sanctions against hundreds of individuals took what now appears to be a scorched earth policy. On many occasions, they seemingly relied on simple Google searches and Russia's rich list, much of which would not have stood up in court.\n\nIn fact, in April, this was proven true.\n\nTwo individuals, Mikhail Fridman and Petr Aven, successfully proved before the European Court of Justice that the European Council had not presented enough evidence to establish that they met the necessary bar of being involved in efforts that \"undermine or threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine\".\n\nNow, another hearing on one of the most egregious cases to date could deal another blow to the sanctions regime.\n\nOn 19 June, the General Court, the Court of Justice of the European Union, held a hearing on the case of Dr Moshe Kantor, former President of the European Jewish Congress (EJC), who stepped back from his position following the Council's decision to include him on the list of individual sanctions in 2022.\n\nKantor is the only democratically elected leader of a European minority community who was included on the individual sanctions list. In his role as a Jewish leader, he met with many European heads of state, European decision-makers and opinion-shapers.\n\nFor his activities, the promotion of tolerance and fighting against xenophobia and antisemitism, Dr Kantor received, over the years, state honours from, amongst others, Poland, Ukraine, Italy, Romania, Belgium, Austria and France.\n\nIronically, French President Emmanuel Macron awarded Kantor with the title of Commandeur de la Légion d'Honneur only a few weeks before France voted, as a member of the EU Council, to sanction him because of Kantor's presumed economic ties with the Kremlin.\n\nDuring the hearing at the EU Court, Kantor's defence team stressed that the whole process against Kantor was born in sin and haste and created an \"exceptional situation\", in which Kantor is sanctioned despite the fact that he has been living for decades away from Russia, has dedicated his life for the fight against antisemitism, promoting tolerance and ensuring the security of Jewish communities in Europe.\n\nMoreover, insisted the defence, the sanctions were renewed time and time again since September 2022 with an \"incomprehensible insistence\" despite all evidence provided to the Council, showing that Kantor ceased all his business activities even before the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014.\n\nAfter the EU Council legal team made its case, clearly exasperated, one of the judges asked again for evidence for the \"mechanisms of benefit\" between Kantor and Russian President Vladimir Putin, a crucial element in the case for sanctions. The Council's lawyers responded that all the evidence had previously been presented and were unable or unwilling to add anything new.\n\nTo demonstrate another problematic part of the accusations against him, Kantor's legal team brought up the fact that the first official file against him stated that he had \"Jewish-Russian\" nationality, a highly problematic and discriminatory appellation used by the Nazis against Jews in the 20th century.\n\nKantor was the only person on the EU sanctions list whose religious affiliation was referred to. This \"mistake\" brought the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, to apologise to Kantor.\n\nA letter signed by Michel0s Head of Cabinet, Frederic Bernard, dated 27 July 2022, explains: \"We sincerely regret the error that has been made by the responsible service with regards to your nationality in the evidence pack and has been rectified. The correct version of the document is enclosed herewith.\"\n\nWhile this was the most controversial, it was not the only error in the case against Kantor.\n\nAccording to numerous articles and experts who have assessed the working files of some of those sanctioned, the evidence compiled was \"slipshod\", \"shaky\" and \"embarrassing\".\n\nThe document used as a basis to sanction Kantor in 2022 contains only 64 pages and includes just eight articles and websites, six of which are machine-translated versions of Russian-language originals. The bulk of the packet consists of screenshots of entire articles, with relevant passages highlighted in yellow.\n\nTwo of the articles, on the Russian web portal Rambler and outlet Vecherniy Murmansk, are labeled on the websites as an \"advertisement\" or \"paid advertisement\", a description that was not included in the evidence packet. It is unknown who paid for these advertisements.\n\nSome of these articles are what can only be described as \"fake news\" pieces, which antisemitically accused Kantor of using his position as a Jewish leader to distort the memory of the Holocaust and minimise antisemitism for personal gain.\n\nAccepting these types of articles at face value, knowing they are paid advertisements on sometimes obscure websites by unknown figures, can themselves be construed as antisemitic.\n\nThe file also mistakenly lists Kantor as a shareholder of Acron, a Russian-based mineral fertiliser producer, instead of as an ultimate beneficiary.\n\nOn the point of Kantor's relationship with Putin, he has not held any business position in Russia for 30 years and has devoted all of his time and efforts to leading the European Jewish community over the last 20 years. No other person on the list is comparable to him in these respects. All the other people listed as \"businesspersons\" have either business positions or capital holdings in Russia.\n\nThe Court has even annulled the Council's decision to retain a businessperson on the sanctions list who left his position a few months before the renewal, as was the case for Alexander Shulgin last September.\n\nAs Kantor's legal team made clear, contrary to many other individuals on the sanctions list, Kantor was never invited to the numerous business forum meetings organised by the Kremlin for leading businessmen in Russia.\n\nIn the hearing, Kantor's legal team asserted that the Council's supposed case is simply based on the idea that one cannot be wealthy and of Russian origin without being a \"leading\" businessperson involved in a sector providing a substantial source of revenue to Russia.\n\nKantor's lawyers spoke about a \"real blindness\" of the Council in front of facts and of \"impossible scenarios,\" accusing Kantor of minimising the dimension of antisemitism in Russia or disproportionally promoting Russia´s role during WWII for personal gains\n\nThe EU Council's legal team admitted several times that mistakes were made in the preparation of Kantor´s sanctions file regarding his nationality and the claim that he was a shareholder of the Acron group.\n\nThe question that requires answering is why Kantor was sanctioned in the first place and remains on the list.\n\nSome have argued that his tireless campaigns for the security of Jewish communities, against antisemitism, as well as fighting Holocaust distortion and denial over the last 20 years, have fueled resentment against Kantor, and some old and baseless allegations against him are now weaponised.\n\nThe jurist Regis Bismuth, professor at the Sciences Po Law School in Paris and Director of Studies of the French Branch of International Law Association (ILA) and an expert on EU sanctions sees a structural failure in the way the sanctions list was prepared, and in the case of Kantor in particular.\n\n\"I think that it is interesting to place this case in the larger background of how sanctions are adopted by the EU Council. In 2022, hundreds of people were listed on the EU restriction measures list. Of course, some of them are deeply connected with the Russian regime, but not all of them,\" Professor Bismuth said.\n\n\"The files on the first group of sanctioned individuals were completed in just a few days. We do not have information on how files justifying individual sanctions were made. We have to keep in mind that many people were put on the list very quickly and often on the basis of information gathered from newspapers, sometimes Russian publications that are not completely reliable, or from social media.\"\n\n\"With Dr Kantor, there is a clear manifest error of assessment. What is particularly shocking about the case of Dr Kantor is that the file is relatively empty, and he appears to have been listed on the basis of his alleged wealth\".\n\nRegardless of the motivations for placing and maintaining Kantor on the sanctions list, the public hearing at the General Court laid bare many problems of the individual sanctions regime.\n\nThat is why a cleanup of the list is long overdue. Those who deserve sanctions should remain, while those who were caught up in the overly tenacious initial compilation should be removed.\n\nThe EU sanctions regime has suffered some recent blows. Disassociating itself from those who clearly have no place on the list would be a good start in its reputational restoration.\n\nEldad Beck is an Israeli journalist.",

Since the Russia-Ukraine war began in February 2022, the EU imposed sanctions on many individuals, but the process was rushed and often relied on unreliable sources. Dr. Moshe Kantor, a prominent Jewish leader and former President of the European Jewish Congress, was sanctioned due to presumed economic ties with the Kremlin, despite his long-standing efforts against antisemitism and his lack of business activities in Russia for decades.\n\nIn June 2023, the General Court of the European Union held a hearing on Kantor's case, where his defense argued that the sanctions were based on erroneous and discriminatory information. The EU Council's legal team admitted to several mistakes in Kantor's file. The case underscores broader issues with the EU's sanctions list, which was hastily compiled and included individuals based on flimsy evidence. The article calls for a thorough review and cleanup of the sanctions list to restore the regime's credibility."

Russia will face increasing difficulties in its defense production, especially its production of armored vehicles. You'll see increasing U.S. and European production coming online. You'll see the introduction of F-16s, which will at least give Ukraine some additional flexibility. Ukraine's strategy through 2024 is going to be to play defense, and hopefully that puts them on a footing for a possible offensive in 2025.\n\nThere are people in Washington who say we can't keep supporting Ukraine because it undermines our ability to prepare for China. But if we're looking at a potential future conflict with China, there are two worlds we could fight it in.\n\nOne is a world in which Ukraine loses. In that world, all of our European allies are going to be laser-focused on protecting themselves from the next attack from Russia. The United States will be more diplomatically isolated, because those 31 NATO allies are going to be much more concerned about their own security than about helping the United States in a fight against China.\n\nThe other world is one in which Ukraine wins. Then you have a Ukraine that is going to be the largest and most capable army in Europe acting as a bulwark against Russian aggression. That gives you a strong European flank to the United States' east. You have countries that are confident not only in their own security but in the collective capability of NATO to deter and defeat aggression. They are going to be more willing to contribute if the U.S. finds itself in a war in the Indo-Pacific. This idea that somehow helping Ukraine leaves us less prepared for a war in China is just seeing the world as flat when it's not.\n\nIt needs to either bring them in or make it clear they're not going to be a member. Leaving them in diplomatic limbo just makes things worse for Ukraine and undermines NATO. Personally, I think Ukraine must become a member, but a bigger question right now is, What does NATO need to do to ensure Ukraine wins this war?\n\nA victorious, unified Ukraine would be the most capable military in Europe, and at that point it would just be foolish not to bring them in.\n\nIncrease its defense industrial base. As long as Russia sees that it's outproducing the combined capabilities of the United States and its European allies in NATO, it will see that it can continue to fight this war. As soon as the United States and Europe match those numbers, the calculus changes.\n\nI'd also like to see NATO air defenses providing a shield over western Ukraine. You've seen Russia fire missiles and attack drones that actually overfly NATO territory. And rather than air defenses from those nations firing at them and shooting them down, they've relied on Ukraine to use its air defenses to do that. The idea that you wouldn't protect NATO skies by engaging those missiles and drones -- it's not only not helping Ukraine, but it's undermining NATO's Article 5 deterrence. I'd also support France's proposal to start bringing troops into western Ukraine, far from the front lines, to provide training on the ground to Ukrainians.\n\nThe same way they've responded so far, which is with a lot of nuclear bluster. They know as soon as they mention tactical nuclear weapons, it will freeze decisionmakers in some capitals.\n\nWe're seeing an increase in threats below the level of military action -- massive amounts of disinformation, illicit finances being used to undermine political processes. NATO has been so successful over the past 75 years that its enemies are trying to use other ways to attack or undermine the alliance. It's going to struggle to define what constitutes an attack, and then to ensure it has the capabilities it needs to respond. You've seen China and Russia engage in these threats below the level of what you would consider conventional military actions. NATO needs to make itself a harder target by developing more capabilities that are below the threshold of direct military confrontation and demonstrating a willingness to use them. But it needs to do that while also upholding the democratic ideas of freedom and openness.\n\nI had considered joining at several points in my life. Then, in 2015, I was the senior adviser on Russia strategy, and I'd participate in these wargames, where Russia was attacking NATO. I was always advocating for more NATO forces forward and, in particular, more U.S. forces. We also consistently found that the U.S. Army had not nearly enough large-scale engineering capabilities. My mom used to always say, 'If you want something done right, then do it yourself.' I decided to join as an Army engineer, not just because I thought it was important for me personally. I was advocating moving forward U.S. military forces, essentially as a tripwire, and I wasn't comfortable doing that if I wasn't willing to put myself in that position.\n\nOne thing the Army has taught me is how the military approaches risk. It doesn't get to decide which missions to pursue. It just has to look at how to assess and mitigate risk, with the understanding that it will always have to accept a certain level of risk to complete the mission. That's something military leaders understand very well, but it's not necessarily deeply engrained in civilian culture. It's also helped me think more broadly about defense and security problems -- not just looking at things and platforms, but at people and leadership.\n\nI was a big Detroit Red Wings fan when I was a kid. Hockey fans might remember, back in the '90s, the Russian Five. It was this line of five Russian players who were brought to the Red Wings and ended up winning several Stanley Cups. Growing up, I would watch Tom Clancy films with my dad, where the Russians were always the bad guys; and then I would watch the Detroit Red Wings, where the Russians were the good guys. It caused this cognitive dissonance in my mind, this contradiction that I wanted to study more. So I pursued Russian studies and international relations in college, and I guess the rest is history.",

The decision to withhold military aid risks not only undermining solidarity but also signalling weakness that could embolden further aggression and escalate conflicts into neighbouring regions.\n\nWestern nations must understand the prolonged nature of the standoff with Russia. Doubts about Russia's future must be dispelled, and fears of its potential dissolution should not dictate policy. The current state of Russia, maintaining a quasi-imperial stance, poses significant threats to global security, including the uncontrolled proliferation of missile and nuclear technologies among adversarial states.\n\nFailure to support Eastern European democracies sends a clear message globally that the era of Western dominance in global affairs is waning. This reluctance could potentially lead to a new era of instability characterised by localised conflicts and the ominous spectre of a major global war, possibly involving nuclear weapons.\n\nThe current ceasefire in Ukraine may prove to be a precursor to potential broader global conflicts. Observers note with concern the West's apparent reluctance or inability to address global challenges. This hesitance emboldens proponents of global realignment, who are increasingly stirring conflicts in the Middle East, East and South Asia, and the Persian Gulf. Russia's actions in Ukraine serve as a catalyst, encouraging proxies worldwide to challenge the existing global order.\n\nThe West is currently being tested on its ability to confront contemporary challenges decisively. Failure to do so could lead to scenarios where critical international corridors, such as the Suwalki Corridor, will fall under threat, or where aggression against Baltic states becomes a reality.\n\nRussian society's deep-seated resentment and nostalgia for its former imperial status exacerbate global tensions. Western democracies must acknowledge their historical responsibilities and the immense international pressures they will face should they fail to adequately support Ukraine with the necessary military aid.\n\nReduced aid to Ukraine not only places the United States and other Western nations under international scrutiny but also shifts the burden of historical responsibility onto them for potentially exacerbating a global crisis.\n\nIt is crucial for NATO to maintain comprehensive support particularly through military aid to Ukraine. The economic and strategic costs of countering Russian ambitions in Ukraine far outweigh the costs of preventive measures.\n\nIt is not solely Ukraine's struggle; the democratic free world must adopt a resolute stance against the current regime in Moscow. This includes setting clear conditions for ending the conflict, maximising Ukraine's military capabilities, and diplomatically isolating Russia to prevent future aggression.\n\nTimely provision of arms and ammunition to Ukraine is critical to avoid scenarios where NATO must invoke Article 5 of its Treaty as a last resort.\n\nThe West faces a critical juncture where its decisions will resonate globally. By unequivocally supporting Ukraine with military aid it needs, the West can demonstrate its commitment to international stability and reaffirm its leadership in an increasingly tumultuous world. The consequences of indecision or half-hearted support would be catastrophic, spawning a dangerous new global order that would threaten peace and security worldwide.",

        "title": "The Future of NATO",
        "body": "To mark NATO's 75th Anniversary summit in Washington, D.C., the Quincy Institute invited leading U.S. and European analysts to comment on the future of the alliance. While differing greatly in their assessment both of NATO's role to date and of how they would like to see it develop in the future, all agree that NATO is facing an exceptionally difficult and dangerous period in its history.\n\nNATO likes to describe itself as \"the most successful alliance in history\" not because it won a war, but because during the Cold War it deterred a Soviet attack on Western Europe and thereby prevented a new world war. What is too often forgotten, however, is that war was prevented not just by NATO solidarity, but also by NATO caution. Successive U.S. administrations -- fully backed by their European allies -- rejected calls for aggressive policies aimed at \"rolling back\" Soviet power in Eastern Europe.\n\nSince the end of the Cold War, by contrast, NATO has become committed to rolling back Russian power even in former Soviet countries on Russia's own borders. As a result of the clash between this and Moscow's determination to maintain a sphere of influence, NATO now finds itself in a proxy conflict with Moscow on the European Continent itself. If this turns into direct war, there is a good chance that it will end with a nuclear exchange. At that point, the question of the future role of NATO will become meaningless, if only because there will be nobody left to ask it.\n\nIf direct war can be avoided, most analysts predict that mutual hostility between Russia and the West will continue for the foreseeable future, and will involve the risk of further clashes around Russia's borders -- for example, over the future of Belarus and Russian access to the exclave of Kaliningrad across NATO territory in Lithuania. How great this threat will be depends on how the war in Ukraine eventually ends, and whether it is through a compromise peace or a petering out into an endless semifrozen conflict.\n\nAnalysts agree that NATO's European members will definitely try to rearm, especially if Donald Trump is reelected and U.S. commitment to Europe seems uncertain. Their efforts in this direction will, however, be hampered by economic stagnation, the conflicting demands of increasingly endangered budgets for health and social welfare, and the resistance of European countries to pooling their military production. In an effort to please Washington and ensure that the U.S. maintains its military presence in Europe, NATO is also likely to make public gestures toward a global role and the containment of China.\n\nIf the U.S. does pull back from Europe to any significant extent, NATO is likely to abandon its expansionist program of recent decades and limit itself to the defense of its existing members. This shift would, however, lead to considerable tensions between NATO members over policy toward Russia.\n\nOne notable result of the war in Ukraine has been the almost complete disappearance from NATO discussions of the threat of climate change, previously described as \"existential.\" Nor does NATO have any strategy for the stabilization of countries to its south, or for addressing illegal migration across the Mediterranean. A few decades from now, however, the growth of these dangers may render many of NATO's existing preoccupations irrelevant.\n\n- Anatol Lieven, Eurasia Program Director, Quincy Institute\n\nSince the end of the Cold War, NATO has gone through many incarnations: NATO, the agent of transformation to bring Eastern Europe into the league of Western democracies. NATO, the fighter in the war against terrorism. NATO, the cybersleuth. The democracy-builder. The rules-based order enforcer.\n\nAnd finally, at its 75 anniversary, NATO seems to be going back to its original mission: a collective defense pact to keep Europe safe -- and Russia out.\n\nIt is not surprising that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has energized the organization and reaffirmed the importance of Article 5 to all member states, big or small. NATO is no longer \"brain-dead\" and certainly has the capacity to deter Russia from attacking its member states.\n\nBut there still is much to do for the alliance to retain its relevance into the future.\n\nThe first is creation of benchmarks and incentives for members to do more for their own defense, so Europe can reduce its reliance on the United States as its sole security guarantor. No matter who gets to the White House in November, American public sentiment is shifting in ways that are certain to have long-term implications for U.S. commitment to European security.\n\nAt a time when Washington views China and the Indo-Pacific as the foremost strategic challenge, Europeans need to develop industrial capabilities so as to have the freedom to make independent decisions for their own destiny. That inevitably means increasing military spending and manufacturing to complement the U.S. role in European security today and develop more autonomous reflexes tomorrow.\n\nNATO also needs to have a clear-eyed view of what its endgame in Ukraine is. Despite the slogan \"Ukraine's defense is Europe's defense,\" Ukraine's Western backers do not have a unified vision for where Ukraine fits in Europe's security. While supporting Ukraine's ability to defend itself against Russian aggression has been critical for the alliance, given that Russia is far from losing the war, it's time to start thinking of how this war ends -- in ways that preserve Ukraine's sovereignty and build a new security architecture for Europe.\n\nUkraine's theory of victory is increasingly looking unachievable to its Western backers. It's not hard to imagine negotiations for a ceasefire -- even with continued Russian occupation in parts of Ukraine -- at some point over the next few years. The U.S. and its allies need to be able to provide sufficient security guarantees for Ukraine, so its leaders and society have the confidence to accept a bitter peace -- and embark toward a more desirable future.\n\nThat means a smaller but stronger Ukraine -- and NATO can be a critical piece of that.\n\nWhat role NATO plays in negotiations to end the war will define the future of the alliance -- and the nature of strategic stability with a nuclear Russia. If NATO can play some role in the creation of a postconflict Ukraine, even in the absence of full membership for Ukraine, it will remain relevant in Europe's future security architecture.\n\nOf course, none of this might happen. Europe may remain divided on the question of strategic autonomy, with many member states following the U.S. lead on geopolitical challenges. There may not be consensus inside the alliance for an active role for an endgame in Ukraine -- leaving the matter entirely to Washington. America's strategic involvement with the Indo-Pacific might make individual member states more eager to strike bilateral arrangements with Washington -- hollowing out NATO's core mission or creating an internal constituency that wants to steer the alliance more toward greater competition with China.\n\nThat, I am afraid, would mean that NATO's perpetual search for a mission will continue into its fourth quarter-century and well into the next generation.\n\nAsli Aydintasbas is a Visiting Fellow at the Brookings Institution's foreign policy program and a Senior Associate Fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.'\n\nIn the European theater, conventional deterrence and defense should be ensured by Europeans. The 300,000 troops in a high state of readiness that the NATO New Force Model envisages on the eastern flank should be European troops. And they should need but a single American to be fully operational: SACEUR.\n\nAs it is, however, those 300,000 troops will still be dependent on American strategic enablers: intelligence, transport, deep strike, etc. Therefore, the European allies should go beyond the capability targets that NATO has currently assigned to them, and acquire all the necessary enablers themselves. That will undoubtedly require a collective effort, such as German Chancellor Scholz's Sky Shield initiative for a unified European air defense system.\n\nThat is where the European Union can help. Not in trying to align capability development and defense planning of its member states under the E.U. flag. After exactly 25 years (the Common Security and Defence Policy was launched in 1999), it is clear that nations do not want this. But the E.U. does have instruments that work, or can work: the European Defence Fund to invest in research and industry and the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) to build modular multinational capabilities. Those should be put to use to help the European allies build a comprehensive, full-spectrum force package within NATO.\n\nIf the Europeans managed to achieve this, this force package would constitute a tangible European pillar of NATO, in terms of capabilities. The U.S. should fully support such a move, and refrain from irritating allies by seeing everything in terms of defense industrial interests. If Europeans spend more money, of course they will want to spend more (not all) of that on European equipment. Washington needs Europe to do more, for it will free up conventional military resources for its own priorities in Asia, while the American nuclear umbrella remains the ultimate guarantee.\n\nIndeed, it is precisely because President Obama in 2012 already made Asia into the U.S.' No. 1 priority that Europeans must build a complete pillar within NATO. Twelve years later, it is about time the European allies stop convincing themselves that whatever happens, the U.S. cavalry will always be there. The reality is that in case of simultaneous wars in Europe and Asia, the U.S. is likely to prioritize the latter. Moreover, E.U. member states can only confidently support E.U. candidate country Ukraine (and Moldova and Georgia) without having to fear direct Russian retaliation, because NATO provides deterrence -- the conventional part of which Europeans must in the end ensure themselves.\n\nAn alliance that rests both on the U.S. and on an autonomous European pillar would be a much more balanced, and therefore more healthy alliance. But the Europeans should also build this pillar to prepare for less-healthy scenarios. If domestic politics lead the U.S. to reduce its commitment to NATO, the Europeans should be ready to seamlessly take over any task that the U.S. might withdraw from. Strategy is all about being prepared to uphold your interests, whatever comes to pass.\n\nProf. Sven Biscop is the Director of the Europe in the World program at Egmont -- The Royal Institute for International Relations in Brussels. He also lectures at Ghent University.\n\nAs with so much else, NATO's future will ultimately depend on the future America chooses for itself. American policymakers would do well to reconsider the wisdom of continuing the 80-year American military presence in Europe. One alternative would be to pursue a \"less-than-grand\" strategy of American engagement that focuses primarily on a regional security arrangement between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada in anticipation of China's rise. If the U.S. is unlikely to ever fully exit the North Atlantic alliance, it might, at a minimum, step aside from NATO's integrated military command, in the manner of Charles de Gaulle in 1966.\n\nGiven that it inhabits an entirely different part of the planet, Europe will naturally confront a set of different challenges from those facing the U.S. The most pressing, if various models are to be believed, will be the challenge posed by mass migration.\n\nFor Europe to have a happy future, it must tend to its own garden, and this necessitates a strategy of containing and mitigating the effects of climate migration. The strategy could be twofold: First, E.U. member states might set up a kind of climate mitigation fund for sub-Saharan Africa, which, in turn, would be coupled with a robust interdiction strategy against illegal migration in the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean.\n\nNATO, as currently conceived by transatlantic elites, is a danger to regional, and indeed, global stability: no NATO expansion, no war in Georgia in 2008; no NATO expansion, no war in Ukraine in 2022. Meanwhile, NATO's 2011 intervention in Libya resulted in the destruction of the Libyan state and mass migration flows across the Mediterranean.\n\nSen. Richard Lugar's indelible phrase, \"Out of area or out of business,\" implied that to survive, NATO had to go hunting for work outside of its borders -- and in the three decades that followed Lugar's recommendation, it did. But it turns out that there is plenty of \"in-area\" work for NATO to do -- only contrary to what transatlantic elites constantly tell us, that work doesn't have to do with the Russians. The threat to Europe's future will not come from its east, it will come from its south -- and the challenge will not be a military one. It will be humanitarian.\n\nTo successfully deal with this, NATO should adopt a medium- to long-term strategy of targeted devolution -- its primary focus would be to defend Europe's borders -- and therefore its prosperity, its identity, and its security. The idea that NATO now has to go further and further \"out of area\" to the Indo-Pacific, is deeply misconceived -- instead, in the coming decades NATO should transform itself into a pan-European coast guard and border patrol -- perhaps in some combination with the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) and the European Gendarmerie Force.\n\nIn the end, if NATO is to actually serve a useful role in securing Europe's future, it needs to abandon its pretensions of being a \"global policeman\" and become, instead, a cop on the beat.\n\nJames Carden is a contributing writer for foreign affairs at The Nation. He served as a policy advisor to the Special Representative for Intergovernmental Affairs and the Office of Russia Affairs at the US State Department.\n\nOver the next generation, the NATO alliance should be prudent about both development and change. Historically, the alliance has excelled at being what it formally is: a defensive military alliance. The alliance had been created to deter the Soviet Union, which it did for the duration of the Cold War. Now its task is to deter Russia. Although Russia's invasion of Ukraine has destabilized Russia's relations with the West, NATO territory has not been attacked, and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of NATO member states has not been challenged by Russia. NATO's most important responsibility is to ensure that this remains the case.\n\nNATO's self-definition as a defensive military alliance does not mean it can or should turn inward. Tensions between Russia on the one hand and Europe and the United States on the other are going to remain high for years, if not for decades. Even if NATO is unable to incorporate new states into the alliance -- Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus, or states in the Balkans and in the South Caucasus -- NATO should be conceptualized as the inner circle of a two-layered strategy designed to contain the spread of Russian military power.\n\nNATO should not be directly involved in the war in Ukraine or in subsidiary wars that flow out from Russia's invasion of Ukraine (in Moldova, say, or in Georgia). Yet NATO members should be deeply committed to ensuring Ukraine's security. Were Russia to conquer Ukraine, NATO's deterrent work would be rendered vastly more difficult. Were the Kremlin to see its war in Ukraine as a dead end, Russia would be easier to deter throughout Europe. In this way does Ukraine's security reflect the overall health of the NATO alliance.\n\nNATO runs two separate risks in its possible course of development and change. These risks can be characterized as overreach and underreach.\n\nOverreach would entail the blurring of lines in the existing struggle between NATO and Russia. If the alliance is not disciplined, it could allow several things to happen: direct forms of conflicts between its members and Russia; direct involvement (of the alliance) in the war; and lack of clarity about NATO's mission, which is to say lack of clarity about whether NATO is a defensive military alliance or an alliance geared toward expeditionary ventures.\n\nNATO has been involved in wars previously -- in Afghanistan and in Libya. NATO has never been involved in a war with a nuclear power. NATO's strategic purpose is to avoid war with Russia or to make such war impossible. Overreach leading to unwanted escalation and in effect to a Russia-NATO war would be catastrophic. It could lead to a nuclear exchange, or it could lead to NATO's backing down (to prevent a nuclear exchange) and thus to NATO's undermining of confidence in the integrity and purpose of the alliance itself.\n\nUnderreach would occur were NATO to be unconcerned with the territory outside its formal perimeter. Were NATO to think of itself as \"fortress NATO,\" preoccupied only with the defense of member states, it could find itself in an increasingly precarious position.\n\nWere Ukraine and Moldova to follow the trajectory of Belarus, NATO would face the Russian military across a very long border: Kaliningrad and Belarus in the north; Ukraine and Moldova in the south and on the Black Sea. The Balkans could become a zone of active contestation. This would be a great multiplicity of challenges for NATO, which Russia could exploit to gain advantage, to instill fear in alliance members, and to compel the United States to pull away from Europe and to concentrate on matters closer to home. Over time, underreach could weaken the alliance dramatically.\n\nNATO will succeed in future years if it can find the golden mean. This means not falling into outright war with Russia; this means preserving the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a Ukrainian state and polity; and this means keeping Russia at bay in the many gray areas that surround the NATO alliance. In sum, NATO's challenges in 2024 are greater than they were in 1949, when the alliance was created. Thus, its adaptability and strategic acumen will have to be greater as well.\n\nMichael Kimmage is a Professor of History at the Catholic University of America.

His most recent book is Collisions: The War in Ukraine and the Origins of the New Global Instability.\n\nThe best development for NATO that one should wish for, I believe (even if the odds against its happening appear daunting at present), is that it should return to its fundamentals: Prevent war, in accordance to its obligation not just to defend all the signatories of the treaty but also to commit itself, in the words of the treaty, \"not to enter into any international commitments that conflicted with the treaty\" and to adhere \"to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\"\n\nThe U.N. Charter states, as its first objective, \"to maintain international peace and security\" and \"uphold international law.\" In other words, in a more perfect world, NATO should work toward peace and not toward managing conflicts solely through military means in the future.\n\nUnfortunately, how NATO probably will develop and change is a very different matter. In his new strategic concept presented at the Madrid Summit in June 2022, Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg set out five points for the development of NATO. Only one of these, \"taking a global outlook,\" was really \"new.\" This \"global outlook\" involves extending the treaty's mandate exponentially. NATO would develop into a supranational organism with tentacles reaching into many corners of the world, if not all.\n\nOn the other hand, a new generation of populist politicians in the United States and Europe will probably not want to take such a \"global outlook\" but will retreat, if trends are anything to go by, to their own shores in the perhaps-mistaken idea that conflicts here and there will not affect them directly.\n\nHowever, the same conflicts ongoing now might already have escalated to the extent that, even a generation ahead, their consequences will instead produce a general desire to project strength, whatever the human consequences. Thus, European nations will have rearmed and retrained their military and will possibly no longer accept the sole leadership of the U.S. in NATO affairs. It will then take a very astute politician to rein in everyone's power instincts: Failing the presence of such a man or woman, NATO could actually break apart amidst exacerbated rivalries, including economic ones, and conflicting nationalist postures and interests.\n\nAnne Kraatz is a Non-Resident Fellow at the Quincy Institute. She was a Senior Fellow at the Institute for Open Diplomacy in Paris, and a member of the Executive Committee of Democrats Abroad in France, in charge of organizing and moderating public debates on U.S. foreign affairs.\n\nNATO was created in 1949 to protect its members against the Soviet threat. During the Cold War, NATO was also very aware of the risks of escalation, some of which were existential. Accordingly, the main aims were to deter armed conflict and to ensure a reliable defense capability. In addition, the alliance sought very early on to contain the risk of a military conflict breaking out by respecting the Soviet Union's central \"red lines\"; it did not even shy away from dialogue and verifiable agreements with an opponent not considered as trustworthy. This attitude found classic expression in the dual strategy from 1967 (the so-called Harmel Report), which is still valid for NATO today. According to this, on the basis of a guaranteed defense capability, NATO was ready for dialogue and détente with the opposing side.\n\nAfter 1989, the bipolar confrontation only seemed to have disappeared. It has not been possible to integrate Russia into a new European security order. Rather, Putin saw that, in particular from the beginning of the 2000s onward, the policies of the U.S. and NATO had not taken into account Russian superpower interests, and that \"red lines\" had been crossed, especially by promising future NATO membership to Ukraine and Georgia. This was also due to the arrogant \"unipolar\" actions of the U.S. administration under George W. Bush and its insensitive focus on military superiority and expanding its and NATO's sphere of influence.\n\nParticularly due to the Russian aggression against Ukraine and the emergence of a Cold War 2.0, it is now important to heed the lessons of NATO's 75-year history:\n\nRegardless of the outcome of the elections in the U.S., however, the European partners must increase their defense efforts in order to focus more on Europe's own security and to be able to assert themselves in the looming phase of global geopolitical upheaval. If this is not possible within the framework of the E.U., a \"core Europe,\" primarily under the leadership of France and Germany, should proceed in order to achieve strategic autonomy in the military area too. This is, moreover, the only way to limit defense spending. At this crucial juncture, the alliance must pursue with sound judgment a realistic security policy aimed at reestablishing sustainable peace and cooperation in Europe and the world.\n\nRüediger Lüedeking is a former German diplomat who served as Permanent Representative to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and Ambassador to Belgium.\n\nIt is imperative for NATO to become more balanced between America and Europe when it comes to burden-sharing. The European members of NATO should organize themselves in a way that they would be able to conduct military operations in their own neighborhood without the direct support of the Americans. While this does not need to be done by the European Union, the E.U. has a key role to play when it comes to providing joint financing for defense procurement and to help develop a European military-industrial policy. Key European members of NATO that are not members of the E.U. -- including the United Kingdom, Norway, and Turkey -- have a lot to offer to such a European pillar of the alliance, and they should be fully integrated into any European defense architecture.\n\nSuch a \"rebalancing\" of the Atlantic alliance -- with the goal of the European members to spend a roughly equal amount of money on defense and having similar military capabilities -- would guarantee that NATO will endure through the 21 century, as it would no longer be subject to the whims of American domestic politics. After all, an international alliance sharing both common interests and common values is equally valuable for both Americans and Europeans, as it would increase both North America's and Europe's influence in the rest of the world, and benefit its citizens by providing stability and security in which their mixed-market economies can continue to grow and thrive.\n\nIn reality, however, there is a substantial risk that European efforts will fall well short of what is needed to achieve a proper rebalancing of NATO. For political economy reasons, current and future American presidents will continue to encourage European allies to buy weapons and military hardware from the United States, and E.U. internal discord over joint financing and the interests of national defense industries will prevent integration of European military procurement. Aging European societies will only increase their demands for more social welfare at the expense of military spending.\n\nIn this scenario, the United States will continue to exert a disproportionate sway over the alliance, which will maintain the unhappy equilibrium of American dominance and European free-riding within NATO, with those perceptions of each side reinforced across the Atlantic, and increased uncertainty over America's future commitment to the alliance. There may also be pressure to expand NATO beyond the Northern Atlantic space, and invite America's democratic allies in the Pacific, including Japan, South Korea, and Australia, to join. NATO would then serve as the U.S. vehicle to contain not only Russia, but also China. If this development materializes, it has the potential of further increasing geopolitical tension between the West and the rest as well as within NATO.\n\nMatthias Matthijs holds the Dean Acheson Chair at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and is a Senior Fellow for Europe at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nAn armistice agreement in Ukraine -- which now seems likely in the foreseeable future -- should include a commitment by NATO and Russia to set verifiable limitations on conventional deployments on either side of a demilitarized truce line. This could either be considered a revamping and redesign of the Conventional Forces in Europe agreement or could be more circumscribed and less ambitious. In either case, for the U.S. in particular, structuring a durable peace would require reactivating diplomatic capacities sidelined during the zero-sum struggle between Russia and NATO.\n\nThe postwar framework should explicitly allow the European members of NATO to increase national defense outlays to achieve a rough balance of conventional capability vis à vis Russia. This would require U.S. acceptance of a collective E.U. role in defense industrial development. The aim of this Europeanization of NATO would be to render the U.S. conventional military force presence in Europe less essential. The U.S. would still extend its nuclear umbrella over NATO members in Europe, but NATO's European pillar would become more capable and have a greater voice in decision-making. NATO should shift its focus from expansion eastward to supporting Europe's development of its conventional defense capabilities, an enterprise likely to take at least a decade.\n\nNATO would remain the principal framework for mutual defense of the Transatlantic West. Russia and NATO should work to revive stabilizing measures to diminish the risk of renewed conflict in Europe, as in the years following the Cuban missile crisis. The restoration of nuclear arms control agreements should be given priority.\n\nThe hard lessons of the last few years have exposed the failure of military power and even the harshest economic sanctions to resolve interstate conflict without unacceptable risk to the broader security interests of all parties. Diplomatic contacts between Russia and the United States would have to be put on a more sober and patient track.\n\nWithout such agreements, the continuation of the war in Ukraine on its current trajectory carries the danger of escalation to direct confrontation between NATO and Russia. The determination of the U.S. and its partners to project unity and resolve in defense of Ukraine has taken on a life of its own and functions as an instrument within an information war, favoring \"narrative\" over reality. The summit in Washington in July risks being absorbed almost entirely in avoidance of any unwelcome controversy over the question of Ukraine's path to membership and in the frantic attempt to make the prospect of eventual NATO membership credible to Ukraine's leadership. Any open debate and frank reflection around shoring up NATO under a possible Trump presidency and exploring scenarios for the end of the war will, at best, remain behind closed doors.\n\nThe nostalgic reification of NATO has played a big role in producing the dilemma now facing us. The July summit will celebrate the revival of U.S. prestige within NATO, the near-unanimity among European allies in supporting \"victory\" for Ukraine, and the restored relevance of NATO in the face of a renewed military threat from Russia to the alliance. The papering over of challenges to NATO and the failure to design and implement reforms will continue so long as there is no consensus around achievable war aims and no effort to find a negotiated end to the conflict.\n\nDr. Molly O'Neal is a Non-Resident Fellow at the Quincy Institute and a former U.S. Foreign Service Officer dealing with Eastern Europe, Russia, and Eurasia.\n\nAlliances are ultimately arrangements between two or more states for security cooperation and are generally targeted against a particular adversary. NATO played this role during the Cold War, with Western European states, Canada, and the United States balancing potential Soviet ambitions on the Continent. Informed by this logic, many analysts predicted NATO's demise after the Cold War; indeed, the alliance's ability to endure and expand in scope (though not coherence and function) after 1991 at least partly motivates claims that the alliance's shared values and institutional anchoring will allow it to thrive in future.\n\nYet there is a simpler explanation for NATO's post-Cold War endurance that ought to give us pause as to NATO's future health. If alliances form largely in response to threats, it follows that they ought to end not simply when an old threat dies, but when a new threat emerges at the same time. From this perspective, the end of the Cold War saw the Soviet Union die, but because no new threat emerged, NATO could continue unimpeded. NATO became a Swiss Army Knife for spreading liberal values, fighting terrorism, and establishing an array of new goals.\n\nToday, however, the situation is different: Domestic politics aside, we see a growing disconnect between European and American priorities. The United States is increasingly focused on China, so much so that the (overstated) China threat is one of the true points of bipartisan consensus in Washington. European states, on the other hand, are divided between those who see a pronounced threat from Russia and those who see an array of challenges from illegal migration and state instability along the southern maritime border.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, NATO's days may be numbered -- at least in its current form. States with diverging or divergent interests can try to paper over their differences. In a world of finite time and resources, however, differing priorities tend to drive alliances apart, as member states place their bets and act out of self-interest. With NATO, this may not result in an abrupt end to transatlantic cooperation, but it does imply a progressive weakening of the commitment, waning coordination, and a hollowing out of the alliance.\n\nIf and as American and European attentions continue to part, the United States may increasingly pass the security buck to the European members of the alliance. Without the ability to steer European security policy, Washington may well look to reduce its exposure to European contingencies -- just as many in Europe may be increasingly growing reluctant to count on U.S. assistance amid a crisis in which, for self-interested reasons, Washington may be unwilling to help. A result could be a NATO that remains alive on paper but, in practice, is primarily a European show.\n\nThis would not be a bad result for the United States. Indeed, the founders of the alliance actually wanted NATO to be a temporary expedient, a shield behind which Western Europe could recover from the devastation of the Second World War before taking on the hard task of balancing the Soviet Union. That original idea was lost for much of the last seven decades. Yet, as NATO celebrates its 75th birthday, geopolitical developments -- more so than domestic politics -- may bring the founders' vision back to the fore.\n\nJoshua Shifrinson is an Associate Professor in the School of Public Policy of the University of Maryland, and author of Rising Titans, Falling Giants: How Great Powers Exploit Power Shifts (2023).\n\nHow NATO should and will develop over the next generation depends entirely on a guess about what happens geopolitically.\n\nFew alliances last even NATO's 75 years. As an institution, NATO is too weak to perpetuate itself against key members' wishes. The alliance will, as always, be fractious, and it's harder to manage with 32+ nations than with the original 12. The U.S. interest in sustaining NATO is in secular decline. Some have predicted that NATO cannot last without the U.S. And an E.U.-based version of NATO is perfectly conceivable if a President Trump or similar were to pull America out.\n\nSo, seen from the outside, it's reasonable to wonder whether NATO will even exist a generation from now. But, viewed from the inside, NATO has staying power. It exists not just to keep Russia out and America in, but to keep Western and Central Europe from disintegrating again along national lines. Presidents Putin and Trump have massively increased European incentives for hanging together -- preferably with but, if necessary, without America.\n\nMy guess is that a generation from now, NATO will still be in sustained military confrontation with Russia; Washington will still not want Europe -- its largest trading and investment partner -- to fall apart, even if the U.S. becomes a semidetached ally; and an E.U.-based alternative still could not rope in British, Turkish, and Norwegian capabilities as effectively.\n\nIn that anxious security context, NATO should develop a European pillar in tighter collaboration with the E.U., pursuing common European procurement goals and smoothing transatlantic defense industrial frictions through NATO's defense planning process. It should remain open to new members who can increase alliance security, including Ukraine. It should secure the Euro-Atlantic for America, leaving the U.S. and other individual allies to operate in the Indo-Pacific. It should be the arms control organization it claims to be, advancing proposals to Moscow to manage confrontation at lower levels of risk and higher levels of deterrence. It should work to be seen internationally as a valued stability generator in an unstable world, investing heavily in its partnerships for military professionalism under democratic political control.\n\nAnd how will NATO in fact develop? Outlier possibilities exist for more significant damage to its cohesion and effectiveness from America's isolationism and China focus, E.U. ideology and incoherence, British and Turkish E.U. complications, Russian and Chinese erosions, and the continuing lack of a shared vision among allies.\n\nIt will be both less European and less transatlantic than it needs to be, less robust and more threatening toward Moscow than it needs to be, more internally factional than it ought to be, and less confident than it should be about working intimately with the E.U. and U.N. on geographical and functional instabilities. It may have lost Hungary and Bulgaria to Russian influence, and it will have gained Ukraine, formally or otherwise. It will be badly divided over China. Strong anti-Americanism in Europe will complicate public politics, but Europe's structural inefficiencies will mean the U.S. is still the essential partner.",

        "summary": "The article discusses the future of NATO as it marks its 75th anniversary, highlighting the alliance's challenges and potential developments. Analysts from the U.S. and Europe agree that NATO faces a difficult period, particularly due to its current proxy conflict with Russia over Ukraine. The article outlines several key points:\n\n1. **Historical Context**: NATO's success during the Cold War was attributed to deterrence and caution, avoiding direct conflict with the Soviet Union. Post-Cold War, NATO's expansion and efforts to roll back Russian influence have led to increased tensions.\n\n2. **Current Challenges**: The war in Ukraine has intensified NATO's focus on collective defense, but it also risks direct conflict with Russia, potentially leading to nuclear war. Analysts predict continued hostility between Russia and the West, with potential flashpoints like Belarus and Kaliningrad.\n\n3. **European Rearmament**: European NATO members are expected to rearm, especially if U.S. commitment wavers, but economic constraints and resistance to pooling military resources pose challenges. NATO may also seek a global role to contain China.\n\n4. **Internal Tensions**: If the U.S. reduces its involvement, NATO might limit its expansion and focus on defending existing members, leading to policy disagreements among members regarding Russia.\n\n5. **Neglected Issues**: The war in Ukraine has overshadowed other threats like climate change and instability in regions south of NATO, which could become more pressing in the future.\n\n6. **Strategic Autonomy**: Analysts suggest that Europe should develop its own defense capabilities to reduce reliance on the U.S., potentially through initiatives like Germany's Sky Shield for air defense.\n\n7. **Future Scenarios**: NATO's future could involve a more balanced burden-sharing between the U.S. and Europe, or it could face internal divisions and a shift in focus towards global challenges like China.\n\n8. **Diplomatic Efforts**: A potential armistice in Ukraine could involve NATO and Russia setting limitations on military deployments, with Europe taking a larger role in its own defense.\n\n9. **Institutional Evolution**: NATO may need to adapt by focusing on regional security and addressing non-military threats like migration and climate change, rather than expanding its global reach.\n\nOverall, the article emphasizes the need for NATO to balance its traditional defense role with new strategic challenges, while fostering greater European autonomy in defense matters."

The government has already reduced cash incentives for exporters by Tk 3,400 crore this year,\" he said.\n\n\"If the government wants to make us competitive in the global market, cash incentives should continue without any reductions until 2029. Additionally, alternative incentives for exporters should be introduced as per the commitment made by government officials,\" added the BGMEA president.\n\nHowever, Dr Ahsan H Mansur, executive director of the Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh, believes there is no need to revise or delay the transition from LDC status to a developed country by 2026.\n\nHe said that the government should support exporters in reaching export targets by 2027, noting that exporters will now need to double their exports to achieve this goal.\n\nThe government should also ensure adequate port facilities, simplify customs procedures, provide uninterrupted gas and electricity, and diversify the export basket to increase export volumes, he added.",

Nearly all have focused on the candidates' delivery, less on what they said, and almost nothing about what should have been but was not said.\n\nTrump was obviously coached by his team to tone down the personal insults, which he mostly did, and scored some policy points while making dozens of false or unverified statements in the process.\n\nMeanwhile, as the general media analysis has also gone, Biden's delivery was a disaster. As one well known TV commentator called it: \"a slow motion car accident\".\n\nThe CNN host network's post-debate analysis panel was particularly critical.\n\nAt least initially. In the post-debate commentary they offered initial assessments like:\n\nhe (Biden) \"seemed disoriented\" and delivered \"an atypically bad performance\" (David Axelrod).\n\n\"His candidacy has fallen\" (Scott Jennings). He was \"not coherent\" and \"real damage was done\" (Abby Phillips).\n\n\"He failed...No two ways about it\" (Kate Bidingfield).\n\nSeasoned election commentator for CNN, John King, called Biden's performance \"dismal\" and said there was now deep panic in the Democrat party. While perhaps the most liberal on the panel, Van Jones, described Biden's delivery as \"painful\", noting the debate was the 'Con Man vs. the Old Man' and the affair appeared as a debate between \"somebody who shouldn't be president and another who can't do the job\".\n\nMany of Biden's harshest critics on the panel were long time Democrat party operatives, like Axelrod, Jones, and Bidingfield. The harshest criticism was leveled afterward by former Presidential debate moderator, Chris Wallace, author of the aforementioned quote \"A car accident in slow motion\". He concluded \"he sunk his campaign tonight\".\n\nIt's clear that several of the panelists were by means of their ear phones connected during the debate with high ranking Democrat party donors and supporters. Van Jones and Axelrod, long time Democrat party operatives and advisers, both referred to calls they were getting during the debate. As Axelrod admitted \"Democrat Party leaders area reacting\" and in a state of panic over Biden's performance. Jones said he even received calls well in the middle of the panel discussion, during a commercial break by CNN, in which he was 'chewed out' by a Biden insider for his previous panel comments.\n\nNot surprising, as the panel discussion went on some of the panelists tried to walk back their earlier public criticism which was contributing to the 'panic', according to some party sources. It's likely that some of the CNN panelists won't be around for subsequent debates if they occur. Or at least they won't be allowed to wear ear phones.\n\nAnyone watching the debate and the post debate commentary might easily conclude that Trump was not all that impressive, reducing his statements and rebuttals every chance he had to the border immigration issue; or making statements like 'he's killing the country\" and \"what he has done is criminal\"; or throwing out wild unsubstantiated charges declaring Biden's policies on abortion led to doctors to killing eight or nine month old.\n\nBiden debated in the dirt no less, often focusing on Trump's infidelity affairs and, in one of his few entertaining 'one liners' declaring \"you (Trump) have the morality of an alleycat\" or \"you're a whinner\". How many times each rebutted the other by simply calling him a 'liar' probably set a record for presidential debates.\n\nAs presidential debates go, this time around the CNN moderators asked no trick questions -- as occurred in prior presidential debates -- and their questions challenged the candidates to address some serious points. But when it came to explaining their policies and proposals neither candidate performed very well. They either ignored the moderators' questions altogether, or drifted off point, slide into another of their favorite topics, or descended into the silliest and most childish attacks on their opponent.\n\nPoll after poll today shows American voters are most concerned about two issues: Economy and War. But anyone watching the debate got no idea what either candidate intended to do for the economy stuck in chronic inflation, interest rates, weakening job market, declining real wages, and a growing fiscal crisis marked by the past eight years of $13.3 trillion additional budget deficits and $14.9 trillion in added national debt. Since 2000 deficits and debt have been doubling every eight years and the worst eight have been the most recent, 2016-2024, under Trump and Biden.\n\nWhen it came to answering the moderators' questions on the economy, Trump ducked their questions altogether several times, used the question to slip into elaborating further on one of his favorite themes like the border, or just answered with an off the wall personal accusation of Biden.\n\nBiden did no better: he mumbled, changed his topic and sentence mid-stream, confused words, and hesitated with long pauses as if he lost his train of thought. At one point after saying the US had a thousand trillionaires, then correcting it to billionaires, he mumbled incoherently for almost a half minute, lost his thought, and ended with a topically unrelated phrase \"we finally beat Medicare\". Trump predictably jumped on it and rebutted, 'Yes, you beat Medicare to death'.\n\nThese kind of petty, juvenile exchanges went on all during the debate. Perhaps the most pathetic, however, was late in the debate when both candidates got into a pissing match over who had the lowest golf handicap. Somehow they then both segwayed into accusing the other being the unhealthiest. Biden charged Trump of being too fat, to which Trump replied he had taken two health tests and passed both with excellent results while Biden hadn't taken even one.\n\nAt that point, following the golf thing, most watchers must have said to themselves: 'what the hell are they talking about'? Then probably followed that by saying to themselves, 'holy shit are we really in trouble'!. Yes, the USA is in trouble. Big trouble. And both the candidates aren't really talking about it. Nor have the slightest idea what to do about it.\n\nWhich brings it all back to what the American voters wanted most to hear in the debate but didn't -- i.e. what are the two lightweights called Trump and Biden going to do about escalating War and declining Economy?\n\nPolls consistently show voters want to know what are the candidates' proposals for dealing with inflation, jobs, runaway annual trillion dollar US budget deficits, the $35 trillion US national debt -- not to mention unaffordable housing, healthcare, child care, and student debt? And on the geopolitical front: what would either do as president about the three wars the US is involved in (Ukraine, Gaza, Red Sea) -- and the fourth that is obviously being planned (Taiwan)?\n\nVery little was revealed by either candidate during the debate as to how they planned to deal with the voters' top issues of War and the Economy. Here's what was not said by the candidates on the real issues of import:\n\nThe Economy\n\nThe very first question the moderators asked the candidates was the state of the US economy. Moderators noted many voters felt the economy was 'worse off', with groceries up 20% and home prices 30% since 2020.\n\nJobs\n\nBiden ducked the inflation question and launched into a statement how great the economy was now. His main point in that regard was his claim he had created 15 million jobs since taking office. That claim, however, is a misrepresentation and a selective interpretation of government statistics that he and the Democrats have been peddling throughout the campaign.\n\nThe fact is the Covid recession of 2020 resulted in 35 million being unemployed at one time or another due to government mandated economic shutdown. When Biden took office in 2021 there were 12-13 million still jobless. The US economy began to reopen in late spring 2021. It was too early. It aborted and only began again to steadily and slowly reopen later that summer 2021. It was in late summer 2021 when inflation began to accelerate.\n\nOver the next two years the twelve million mandated jobless returned to the jobs they had left. But these were not new jobs Biden 'created'. These were jobs workers 'returned to'. Biden did not create those 12 million jobs. There were additionally some net new jobs created in addition to those 'returned to' over the course of Biden's term. About 2.7 million. However, they have been mostly part time jobs not full time. Only by manipulating the numbers is Biden able to claim he created 15 million jobs.\n\nAs for the unemployment rate of 4% and Biden's claim it's the lowest in decades, that too is questionable. The 4% is what the US Labor Dept. calls the U-3 unemployment rate which refers only to full time workers. The government has another statistic that rarely gets reported in the mainstream media. It's called the U-6 unemployment rate and it covers not only full time workers but part time, those who've given up looking for work, dropped out of the labor force altogether, and simply haven't filed for unemployment benefits even though they're jobless. That also official US government U-6 unemployment rate is 7.4%, not 4%; or almost twice the always reported lower U-3 number by the mainstream media.\n\nTrump of course had no idea about these clarifications of Biden's misleading jobs claims. Nor apparently did his advisers. So Trump simply failed to challenge Biden on these job numbers.\n\nInflation\n\nThe moderator's question about why many voters don't feel economically 'better of' included a reference to a basket of groceries up 20% and home prices 30% since Biden. Biden's answer was he brought prescription drug prices down, referring to insulin prices for seniors on Medicare.\n\nTrump said he did it. Biden said he did. What ensued was a 'he said, she said' silly exchange. But the fact is prescription drug prices in general are going through the roof. And drug price inflation is not accurately picked up by the official US government inflation statistics. For example, he newest drugs aren't included. Nor factored into inflation are pharmaceutical companies moving their existing drugs into higher 'tiers' in their formulary (list of drug prices).The most purchased drugs' prices are raised more than average, while thousands of drugs not purchased hardly any more are not. The result is a lower average price for all drugs that the government uses in its inflation statistics.\n\nIt was at this point following the drug price inflation, only three minutes into the debate, that Biden went off the rails mumbling incoherently about several unrelated topics, going silent for loss of words, and concluding with the \"we finally beat Medicare\" comment.\n\nIf Trump had been prepared he could have elaborated on what's really happening with the costs of medical services -- a topic on which Biden remained silent for good reason since hospital and medical services are recently among the fastest rising services inflation.\n\nBiden instead repeated his campaign line that more people now have medical insurance than ever before. But at what cost? And how much coverage given the higher cost? According to research by the Kaiser Family Foundation, monthly health insurance premiums for a $65k/yr median income family of four are now about $2,000/mo. ($23,968/yr); for an individual $8,435 a year. Moreover, for 51% of households the same monthly premiums have deductibles of $2k-$3k per year. The other 49% households have deductibles of $600-$900/yr. What good is medical insurance coverage if the cost of insurance is unaffordable?\n\nThe debate moderators indicated housing prices had risen 30% and asked what either candidate would do about it. Once again, Trump ducked the question altogether and went on to rail about the border, immigration, and rapes and deaths caused by terrorists and criminals at the border. Biden too ducked the question, trying to turn it into the topic of tax cuts -- Trump's and his.\n\nHere's why both candidates didn't want to talk about housing costs or inflation in general:\n\nAccording to the Wall St. Journal in a recent June 2024 survey, home prices have surged 50% not 30% as the moderators noted. But even that 30% is a gross underestimate. What people pay is a mortgage which includes interest charges and other fees not just a monthly principal on the price of the house. Nor are any other interest costs, in credit cards, auto loans or any other source. If they were, the government's formal price indexes would be much higher since the CPI does not include in its inflation estimate any of the above mortgages, fees, etc. And according to the Wall St. Journal, 'Home Monthly Mortgage Payments' have risen 114% under Biden.\n\nRent prices follow home mortgages. But US government's price indexes like CPI and PCE only record 'new leases', not renters whose landlords raised their existing rents. Then there's the further trend of landlords adding all kinds of new monthly fees to their rents. That too is not picked up in the official inflation stats. Even so, government limited statistics still show rent increases exceeding 20% since 2021. In reality, it's at least 30-40% and far more in some cases.\n\nPrices for processed foods have also surged since 2019. These prices are subject to big monopolistic corporations' price gouging. Processed foods inflation is responsible for most of the 35% rise in the most often purchased grocery goods since 2019, according to the Journal.\n\nGovernment statistics show many basic household food staples have risen significantly since 2019: Bread up 52%, Eggs 114%. Pound of chicken breast 37%. Milk 24%. And food 'away from home' category (restaurants, bars, etc.) is also rising faster than reported. For example, the US statistics for 'food away from home' don't include the recent ratcheting up of tips charges, in some restaurants mandatory. Tip rates used to be 10%, 15% and 18% at most. Now it's an automatic 18%, 22% or 25% to the restaurant bill. Fast food away from home, that many low income households rely upon, has fared no better. Statistics show that a 'Big Mac' meal is up 27% since 2019.\n\nTransportation is the third largest weighted category in the inflation statistics. It includes the prices of autos, auto insurance, repairs, cost of a gallon of gas and other items. Car prices surged in 2021-23 and then leveled off, making the latest year stats appear 'tamed'. But auto insurance has accelerated by more than 20% the past year alone, following auto repair services up by at least that amount. Gasoline initially accelerated in 2021-2022 due to global and domestic supply issues, then leveled off. When prices 'level off' it appears the inflation has abated. But consumers remain paying the previous higher prices and that's what they remember. Consumers remember they are now paying 38% more for a gallon of gas since Biden took office.\n\nPoliticians, mainstream media, and many mainstream professional economists have been spinning the message that the US economy is doing great. Inflation is under control. Unemployment low. As Biden said during the debate \"The US is the greatest economy in the world\". But consumers know what they're actually paying, workers know what they're actually getting paid and the extra jobs they have to take on to make ends meet. Consumers and workers have longer memories than the politicians, media and economists want them to have. They know what the inflation and job score is since 2019. And don't care that much what the others say about the last six months or even year.\n\nIn short, the tens of millions of the roughly 130 million households in the USA know when the politicians or their mainstream economists echo chamber keep telling them 'Oh, the economy is doing great!' is not the reality they face.\n\nTax Cuts\n\nAt another point in the debate the moderators raised the question of Trump's 2018 tax cuts and if the candidates, especially Trump, would once again support the extension of the cuts coming up in 2025. Trump totally ducked the question, except to say his tax cuts -- which by the way amounted to $4.5 trillion over a decade -- produced a massive number of jobs. That job creation of course did not occur. The tax cuts of 2018 went mostly to wealthy investors and US businesses and corporations, who then either hoarded the savings or plowed it back into financial markets or invested abroad. Very little went into investments that resulted in business expansion that created jobs.\n\nUnder Trump's first three years before Covid hit in 2020, the Fortune 500 corporations returned more than $3.5 trillion in stock buybacks and dividend payouts to their shareholders. Under Biden it's been closer to $4 trillion. During the debate Biden indicated he wanted to raise taxes on individuals earning more than $400k a year in income. That was blocked by Senators Manchin and Sinema of his own party, as were efforts in general to roll back Trump's $4.5 trillion. Biden refused to pressure either of these rogue Senators the past three years. Both are now leaving the Senate. Moderators should have asked Biden, now that Manchin and Sinema will be gone, if he now will reverse the Trump tax cuts if elected.\n\nDeficits & Debt\n\nOn the matter of the budget deficit which has been chronically running at more than $1T a year since 2019 and is expected to hit $1.9T this year, neither candidate had much to say. Trump mentioned it in general and Biden not at all. Nor did either say anything about how the accumulation of those annual deficits have created the current national debt of $35 trillion -- with annual interest payments of more than $800 billion and rising.\n\nBoth candidates' virtual silence to discuss the topics of deficit and debt likely had something to do with the fact that both of them have been responsible for record levels of deficits and debt on their watch: annual budget deficits rose $5.5T under Trump and $7.8T under Biden. The national debt accelerated an addition $7.7T under Trump and $7.2T under Biden. It's important to note that the record acceleration in both deficits and national debt occurred within just four years for Trump and Biden -- exceeding the levels attained over eight years in the case of both George W. Bush and Barack Obama. In short, Trump's contribution to escalating deficits and debt were just as bad as Biden's. No wonder neither candidate wanted to 'go there' and discuss the issue. Pointing fingers at the other would amount only to pointing fingers at themselves.\n\nMeanwhile, the continuing escalation of both deficits and debt constitute a major economic issue, as the driving forces for both -- tax cuts for corporations and the rich, slow growth of the economy despite massive fiscal stimulus, and chronic wars and their costs -- are policies both candidates fully endorse in their actions if not their campaign rhetoric. What would they do if elected about the trillion dollar plus annual US deficits and debt -- a question directly asked by the moderators -- was essentially ignored by both candidates.\n\nMeanwhile, a fiscal train wreck of the US economy is emerging that will result in massive social spending cuts in 2025 and after. But no one addressed that either. The moderators didn't even raise it.\n\nTariffs\n\nBiden challenged Trump's recently announced proposal to raise tariffs on all imports and use the revenue to eliminate the corporate income tax. He charged it would be inflationary as corporations passed on the higher costs to consumers. Trump hit back with the charge he (Biden) has been agreeing with his tariff policy by continuing his (Trump) tariffs and expanding them against China as well. But that exchange about tariffs was as far as both candidates went in discussing the increasingly unstable global economy. The subject of the state of the global economy and its consequences for the US was simply 'several pay grades' beyond their intellect.\n\nMissing in the debate as well was any discussion whatsoever as to how the Biden sanctions on Russia and China have encouraged the rapid expansion of the BRICS countries. Formerly five countries, since Biden's sanctions policies the BRICS have doubled in number to 11 with 25 more applying for membership this year. Nor was it asked how the BRICS's forthcoming new global financial structure later this year will impact the US economy in 2025 and beyond.\n\nThat growth of the BRICS and its consequences is perhaps the single most important global economic development unfolding today. However, what the BRICS expansion means for the US economy was never even raised in the debates, let alone debated.\n\nTo sum up regarding the quality of the debate on the topic of the economy, neither candidate had the capacity, or even apparently any interest, in addressing the critical economic issues the country faces. Both candidates either ducked questions by the moderators that were related to economic matters or diverted the discussion to their pet topics when the moderators raised important economic issues. In other words, neither proposed solutions to the pressing economic issues voters want to hear.\n\nThe Wars\n\nThe same inability and/or refusal to explain how they'd deal with the deepening US involvement in the wars abroad further characterized the presidential debate.\n\nOrganizers began setting up early Monday morning on the University of Oregon campus in Eugene. They say the encampment isn't intended to interfere with campus activities or classes. (Source: Nathan Wilk / KLCC)\n\nThe USA is currently mired in three wars -- all of which appear to be intensifying:\n\nUkraine, Israel in Gaza and soon perhaps Lebanon, and in the Red Sea with Yemen.\n\nBiden's regime has been paying the bills for all, totaling at least $300 billion so far -- i.e. a major cause of the US deteriorating budget deficits and national debt. The USA is also deeply involved in providing weapons in all three; and increasingly as well in manpower in the form of advisers and officers on the ground in Ukraine and Israel, and a full US navy carrier task force in the Red Sea. Direct weapons and other financial aid costs has amounted at least to $200-$250 billion; add another minimum $50 billion in Pentagon OCO (overseas contingent operations) costs.\n\nUnfortunately the candidates were not even asked if the US can continue to afford that level of spending; or if the returns so far have justified it.\n\nWhen asked on the subject before the debate Biden's response has been consistently that the US can afford multiple wars. As he put it: 'What do you mean. This is the United States of America. The most powerful country the world has even seen!\"\n\nHis view the US can afford and fight multiple wars has been echoed by other members of his administration, like Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. However, neither Biden or Yellen have said who will have to do with less in order to continue to pay for USA's multiplying war involvement -- which by many estimates exceeds $8 trillion in the past two decades? Where's the money in the next four years to come from: What social programs will be cut in 2025-28 if either is elected? Whose taxes raised? Or how much more debt will have to be issued by the US Treasury on top of the US current $35 trillion national debt -- the latter now projected to rise to $54 trillion by 2033 with annual interest costs well over $1 trillion/yr payable to bondholders?\n\nThe only detailed exchange on Wars between the candidates was Afghanistan.\n\nBiden bragged \"we got 100,000 out\". To which Trump retorted that US soldiers died in the retreat which was hastily and sloppily conducted, made the US look weak and somehow, per Trump, encouraged Putin to invade Ukraine. Those remarks opened the door for Biden to jump into his favorite war subject: the Ukraine conflict.\n\nHe accused Trump of giving the green light to Putin to invade -- i.e. contradicting the history of events from June 2021 to February 2022 during which Biden policy was to refuse to even talk to Putin, rejected all requests to do so, and instead encouraged Zelensky in Ukraine to make increasingly provocative statements about joining NATO and intentions to militarily invade the eastern Ukraine provinces. Trump criticized Biden's Afghanistan pull out but never understood it as a link in the Biden decision in early 2021 to provoke war in Ukraine. The USA retreat from Afghanistan was a 'clearly of the decks' to prepare for war with Ukraine.\n\nBiden's remarks on the war in Ukraine avoided the moderator's direct question what did he plan to do about it.\n\nInstead, Biden repeated one-liners straight out the 1970s cold war era saying\n\n\"Putin is a war criminal. He wants to restore the Soviet Empire and won't stop there\".\n\nOr \"Just see what happens to Poland if Putin wins in Ukraine\".\n\nIn other words, the old 'dominoes theory'. Just as that view was the center piece of US ideology during the Vietnam war, Biden's view of the war in Ukraine is taken from the US war justification playbook during the 1970s. The moderators' question how would he address the US wars abroad was a non starter. Biden answered indirectly 'he wouldn't'. Biden policy is US can afford multiple wars which he intends to continue.\n\nLater in the debate Biden spouted even more worn out 1970s ideology about US power. So the debate audience was treated to such statements during the debate like: \"we're needed to protect the world. We're a powerful nation.\" And then the kicker: \"everybody trusts us\". Listening to Biden one gets the impression we're half a century back in the old cold war with the USSR. Even more scary, he apparently actually believes he is?\n\nTrump's line of argument on Ukraine as well as Israel was as simplistic: if he were president the wars wouldn't have happened. Somehow, he suggested, he would have been so threatening to all sides of the conflicts in Israel-Gaza and Ukraine that they would have cowered in fear of his threats and not gone to war in the first place.\n\nSo there was no need to explain what to do about them now; they wouldn't have happened.\n\nIn the case of Israel, when asked by moderators if he, Trump, supported a Palestinian state he dodged the question and instead criticized Biden for restraining Israel: \"Biden's holding Israel back. Israel wants to go. Let them go\". Trump's animus toward Iran is well known. It is likely he wouldn't need much encouragement to provoke a war with Iran should that latter country support its Hezbollah allies in the event of an Israel attack into Lebanon. Trump may be 'softer' on the Ukraine war but even more aggressive than Biden on a middle east one focusing on Iran. It wouldn't be the first time a US president ended one war and, to placate the pro-war forces in the US, start up another.\n\nOn the Ukraine war Trump was, and has been, more amenable to forcing a compromise with the Russians. In the debate, and on many occasions before, his main charge against Biden is the cost of Ukraine so far, which to date is in excess of $200 billion according to Trump. So the main problem is the US is spending too much money on it. Get the Europeans to cough up more is the suggestion. In a sense, Trump's position on Ukraine is an extension of his more general view that Europe/NATO should pay more.\n\nTo sum up Trump on the Israel and Ukraine wars: neither would have happened. He would have been tough and intervened and gotten all sides to settle beforehand. Israel is different than Ukraine, however. Iran has always been on Trump's shit list; Russia has not. So based on his comments in the debate, if elected he would likely approve a broader war in middle east if it meant going after Iran. Which seems somewhat ironic since, in the debate, he accused Biden of war policies as \"driving us to World War 3\".\n\nBiden's view on Ukraine is apparently just to continue as is. In place of answering the moderators' question how he might resolve the conflict, it's clear Biden's generalities in the debate mean let the war continue. Resolution occurs only when Russia is defeated. After all, if he's not, the Russians will eventually march on Paris! He didn't say Paris, but did say Poland. Dominoes again! Spending money on the wars may have been the core concern of Trump, but for Biden money is not the question. The US and NATO should spend as much of it as needed.\n\nOn Israel Biden refused to get specific. He said little if anything since the US position is to let Israel proceed in Gaza, fund whatever it asks of the US, and do what it must to prevent a further attack on Israel from other quarters or at least to contain it and prevent a wider war breaking out. However, none of this was discussed in the debate by Biden.\n\nThe other two wars -- Red Sea with the Houthis and with China over Taiwan -- were never raised as questions and therefore easily avoided altogether by both candidates. A simple query from the moderators might have been: 'why is a full task force of the US Navy unable to stop the Yemenis from sinking ships and preventing two thirds of the normal flow of container shipping traffic through the Red Sea'? Or how much is it costing the US to maintain a carrier task force off the Arabian peninsula?\n\nAnd then there's biggest war in planning by the USA: against China in Taiwan. Not a word asked, and not a word said about Biden administration plans now being implemented to prepare for a war with China over Taiwan. Moderators could at least have asked about recent US admirals and generals stationed in the far east who have publicly been saying war with China was inevitable and coming by 2030?\n\nOr the moderators might have asked: 'why are US Marines now landing and occupying Philippine islands within view of Taiwan and elsewhere in the South China sea and training again to carry out amphibious landings?\n\nOne can understand why Biden, the author of the pending conflict, wouldn't want to debate such matters. Perhaps the moderators got that message before developing their lists of questions. Or maybe the questions list was vetted by the parties (which was the case in fact). But Trump limited his criticisms of Biden China policy during the debate to the topic of tariffs.\n\nApart from questions of War and Economy there were other glaring omissions in the debate. At one point the moderators specifically did ask each candidate what they would do about the fact 2023 was the hottest year on record? Biden said he passed legislation -- presumably the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 -- that subsidized businesses investing in alternative energy. Biden also hyped his 'climate corps' idea. Trump ducked the question of climate change, referring instead to the need for 'clean water and clean air'. Both candidates briefly indulged in an unintelligible discussion of the Paris Climate Accords.\n\nIn other words, there was not much substantive discussion over what is in fact a 5th war underway: the war on Nature. Or rather one should say Nature's war on us which Nature so far is winning. Neither candidate thus answered the moderators' question on 2023 the hottest year on record which is another way of saying: what are you going to do to prevent the climate from warming to the 2 degrees or more tipping point to which it is on track by 2035? Just as the candidates failed to provide answers how they would resolve the four US wars underway or in planning, so too the 5th was brushed off and left unanswered.\n\n*\n\nNote to readers: Please click the share button above.

        "summary": "The article \"The Presidential Debate That Wasn't\" from Global Research critiques the first U.S. presidential debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. It highlights that the debate was marked by poor performances from both candidates, with Biden's delivery being particularly criticized by media analysts and Democrat operatives. The debate failed to address key voter concerns such as the economy and ongoing wars. Both candidates avoided substantive discussions on critical issues like inflation, job creation, housing costs, and the national debt. They also did not provide clear plans for handling U.S. involvement in multiple international conflicts, including those in Ukraine, Gaza, and the Red Sea. The article suggests that neither candidate demonstrated a clear understanding or strategy for addressing the pressing economic and geopolitical challenges facing the country."

        "body": "London, Jul 3 (PTI) Stop Labour Party's \"supermajority\" is the final message British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is trying to drive home on Wednesday, the last day of campaigning ahead of polling day on Thursday, as most of the incumbent Conservatives seem to have all but conceded defeat in the landmark general election.\n\n\"This is what unites us. We need to stop the Labour supermajority that will put up your taxes. The only way to do that is to vote Conservative tomorrow,\" said the 44-year-old British Indian Conservative Party leader on social media, as he focused on drumming up support in the last few hours of the campaign trail.\n\nAlso Read | Pakistan: PTI Chief Imran Khan Seeks Permission From Rawalpindi Court To Meet His Sons, Qasim and Sulaiman, in Adiala Jail.\n\nWith his party trailing far behind the Keir Starmer-led Labour Party, Sunak and his team's strategy seems to be to canvas their traditional voters to ensure a strong enough turnout in the polls on Thursday and narrow the gap of their widely expected defeat after Tory victories in the last three elections.\n\n\"I totally accept where the polls are at the moment means that tomorrow is likely to see the largest Labour landslide majority - the largest majority that this country has ever seen. Much bigger than 1997,\" Sunak's Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride told the BBC.\n\nAlso Read | Russia-Ukraine War: Russian Missiles and Drones Strike Dnipro in Daylight Attack, Killing at Least 5, Injuring 47.\n\n\"I have accepted that where the polls are at the moment... that we are therefore tomorrow highly likely to be in a situation where [Labour has] the largest majority that any party has ever achieved,\" he said, effectively conceding his party's defeat.\n\nIt is being seen as a fear tactic to jolt Tory voters into action, with the hope of keeping the Labour majority under that won by former prime minister Tony Blair-led Labour Party in 1997 of 179 seats.\n\n\"Thursday's vote is now all about forming a strong enough Opposition. One needs to read the writing on the wall: it's over, and we need to prepare for the reality and frustration of the Opposition,\" Suella Braverman, sacked as home secretary by Sunak, told 'The Telegraph' newspaper.\n\nDuring a hectic final two days of campaigning Sunak has said that the outcome of the election is \"not a foregone conclusion.\"\n\n\"People can see that we have turned a corner,\" Sunak, who has been in office since October 2022.\n\n\"It has been a difficult few years, but undeniably things are in a better place now than they were,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, former prime minister Boris Johnson - not exactly a close ally of Sunak ever since the partygate scandal of COVID pandemic law-breaking parties - was also rolled out by the party at a campaign event in London to warn against a \"sledgehammer majority\" being handed to the Keir Starmer led Labour Party.\n\n\"When Rishi asked me to come and help, of course I couldn't say no. We're all here because we love our country,\" Johnson told a cheering Tory crowd.\n\n\"They can achieve nothing in this election except to usher in the most left-wing Labour government since the war with a huge majority, and we must not let it happen,\" he warned.\n\nThe Labour Party, meanwhile, is keen to override this message of victory as a foregone conclusion a day before the polls to fight against any complacency within the ranks and among its own voter base.\n\n\"People are saying the polls predict the future - they don't predict the future, every single vote counts, every single vote has to be earned... It isn't 'job done',\" said Starmer.\n\nStarmer on Wednesday said the claims of the governing Conservatives that his party is on course for a very large election victory in Thursday's election amounted to \"voter suppression\".\n\nHe said: \"It's really voter suppression.\"\n\nStride was \"trying to get people to stay home rather than go out and vote,\" he was quoted as saying by the BBC.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at a campaign election event, he said: \"If you want change you have to vote for it.\n\n\"I know there are very close constituencies across the country, I don't take anything for granted.\n\n\"I respect the voters, and I know that we have to earn every vote until 10 o'clock tomorrow night,\" who hopes to be the next British prime minister, said.\n\nPolling experts have forecast a low turnout, which stood at 67 per cent in the last general election in December 2019 when Johnson won a solid majority on his \"get Brexit done\" message.\n\nOn Thursday, polling booths will open across the country at 7 am local time and close at 10 pm local time as voters elect their MPs for the UK Parliament's 650 constituencies - with 326 required for a majority and to avert a hung Parliament.\n\nAll eyes will then be on the election night exit poll at 10 pm, which gives a fair snapshot of what can be expected nationally as the counting commences and centres up and down the UK. If opinion polls are to be believed, the incumbent Tories are in line to win anywhere between 53 and 150 seats, with Labour projected to win a landslide.",

        "body": "\"If you poke the Russian bear with a stick, don't be surprised if he responds.\" -- Nigel Farage , UK Reform party\n\nWhat Napoleon and Hitler failed to do, NATO and EU got into the expansion game by breaking USSR to Russia in the 1991 breakup. The US goal is to weaken Russia as a military power. US Secretary Austin said, \"We want Ukraine to win. One of our goals has been to limit Russia's ability that's why we are arming the Ukrainians with weapons and equipment to defend themselves from Russian attacks. We are using sanctions and export controls that are directly targeted at Russia's defense industry to undercut Russia's economic and military power to threaten and attack its neighbours.\"\n\nSo, the decision to end this Russia-Ukraine war lies with the West, US-NATO-EU. In this Russia-Ukraine war, Russia is the aggressor but the West US-NATO provoked Putin to the point of no return. This Russia-Ukraine war is the longest and most destructive since World War II creating a global crisis. This US-NATO Proxy War on Russia will continue through Ukraine. The objective of the West has throughout been to prolong the conflict for as long as possible and the same has been reflected in the recent Swiss Peace Initiative (15 and 16 June 2024) without Russian participation. Victory over Russia was a near impossible dream so now prolong the conflict for as long as possible. Everyone preaches that negotiations are the best shot for peace but where are they on ground for the Ukraine-Russia War including the Swiss Peace Initiative? Peace to end the war was nowhere on the agenda!\n\nG7 (Group of Seven: US, Italy, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, and Britain) major powers foreign ministers met on Capri Island, Italy on April 18, 2024, and pledged to bolster Ukraine's air defences and asked China to stop supporting Moscow's military industry if it wanted good relations with the West! The G7 Foreign minister acknowledged they had to do more to help Ukraine, which is struggling to hold off stronger Russian forces. Ukraine President Zelensky said that his country has \"A Chance at Victory\" over Russia with the new armaments package!\n\nThe West and the US has for decades been directly or indirectly involved in wars in other countries' by supporting proxy wars, inciting anti-government insurgencies, providing weapons and ammunition, and training anti-government forces, which have caused serious harm to the stability and security of the world. The West is aware of its initiated wars and expansionist power politics for two centuries.\n\nRecently a senior US politician and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham unabashedly stated in a media interview that Ukraine holds business value for the US. He claimed that there are \"10 to 12 trillion dollars of critical minerals\" in Ukraine, and the primary reason for supporting Ukraine is to seize these critical minerals by defeating Russia on the battlefield. Furthermore, he advocated for seizing and using frozen Russian assets in Europe and the US. (GlobalTimes).\n\nSuch remarks reveal the true intentions behind the US and NATO political elites' current policy toward the Ukraine crisis. \"Now you know why the West won't allow peace talks.\" The rest of the world may be keen to end the War, but the West's, US-NATO is only keen to prolong the conflict for as long as possible to weaken Russia as seen from various meetings over the years and Peace talks with a ceasefire to end the war is nowhere in the horizon. May be the likely leadership changes post elections in the US and France bring this war to an end? Donald Trump has repeatedly said he could settle the war between Russia and Ukraine in one day if he's elected president again. Russia's UN ambassador says he can't.\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who is an outspoken critic of Western military aid to Ukraine urged (02 July) Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to consider a ceasefire to accelerate an end to the war with Russia during his first trip to Kyiv in more than a decade. Orban said \"I asked the president to think about whether we could reverse the order, and speed up peace talks with a ceasefire first,\" Orban said.\n\nThere are no current negotiations between Ukraine and Russia and, based on public statements by Zelensky and Russian President Putin, the two sides appear as far apart as ever when it comes to the terms of a potential peace settlement. Unity between North America and its allies across the Atlantic Ocean is key as Europe faces a full-scale war and tensions rise around the globe, says outgoing NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. He had earlier told the Economist that alliance members should let Ukraine strike deep into Russia with Western weapons, a view supported by some European members of the transatlantic alliance but not the United States.\n\nIt's, therefore, the duty and responsibility of the UN and the West US-NATO to find ways to stop the Ukraine war. Under Article 24 of the UN Charter, the UN Security Council (UNSC) has\"primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.\" However, the UN has repeatedly failed in itsprimary responsibility. All wars end but wonder how will this war end with No Winners?",

Casualties included six media workers, 26 employees of healthcare institutions, five humanitarian workers, and 28 emergency service workers.\n\nIt added that the majority (91 per cent) of the casualties occurred in territory controlled by Ukraine, and nine per cent in Russian-occupied territory.\n\nIn the reporting period, Russian authorities reported that 91 civilians were killed and 455 injured in the Russia from attacks launched by Ukrainian armed forces, primarily in Belgorod, Briansk, and Kursk regions.\n\nPowerful weapons\n\nUN monitors identified the use of powerful air-dropped bombs and missiles in populated areas and at least five instances of successive attacks on the same location, just as first responders arrived on the scene, causing casualties.\n\nThe spring escalation in hostilities also saw Russian armed forces launch their \"largest campaign of attacks\" against critical energy infrastructure since the winter of 2022-23, killing and injuring civilians, while also affecting millions of people across the country with power cuts, the report said.\n\nRippling effects\n\nThe attacks also had rippling consequences on water supplies, mobile and internet access, and public transportation, Ms. Bell noted.\n\n\"The full impact of the attacks on energy infrastructure will only be clear this upcoming winter when the reduced power-generating capacity of Ukraine could leave many without access to heating and other services necessary for their survival,\" she said.\n\nAmong other findings, the report noted that the Russian armed forces pressured civilians in occupied territory to get Russian citizenship to receive medical services and keep their property rights.\n\nThe report will be presented to the Geneva-based Human Rights Council on 9 July.\n\nUN Assembly President visits Ukraine\n\nOn Wednesday, the President of the UN General Assembly completed a two-day official visit to Kyiv, where he met with several official leaders including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nIn his discussions Assembly President Dennis Francis stressed that the Russian aggression against Ukraine violated the UN Charter.\n\nHe reiterated the General Assembly's commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.\n\nMr. Francis also noted that the Organization has worked closely with the Government, local authorities and international partners to rebuild Ukraine from the destruction.\n\n\"I would like to think the darkest of the night is behind Ukraine, not ahead of it,\" he said, expressing hope that the recent Summit for Peace in Ukraine would bring further progress in the near future.\n\n/UN News Release.

        "title": "UAE and BRICS - the implications for illicit financial flows and extradition of the GuptasUAE and BRICS - implications for illicit financial flows and extradition of the Guptas",
        "body": "The Gupta extradition case ought to be among the key points of bilateral engagement between South Africa and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as a first step towards the advancement of meaningful dialogue and strong cooperation on combating illicit financial flows (IFFs).\n\nIn August 2023, the BRICS grouping - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - invited six other countries to join the alliance from 1 January 2024, paving the way to what is now casually referred to as BRICS+.\n\nThe invited countries were Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Argentina. However, Argentina's new president, Javier Milei, withdrew the country from joining BRICS after a review of decisions taken by the preceding government.\n\nThe expansion of the BRICS group undoubtedly presents new opportunities and challenges for both existing and new members. Much of the attention from political commentators and popular media has been centred around the economic profile of new members and the implications of an expanded BRICS on the US-led international order.\n\nThere is little attention towards detailed prospects for bilateral cooperation that BRICS expansion presents for both new and existing member states. As argued by Alice Pannier, strong bilateral cooperation is an important phase of engaging in international negotiations, as mutual interests are first developed on a bilateral level to build coalitions and more effectively highlight those interests in multilateral settings.\n\nThus, the strength, coherence, and unity of the BRICS+ grouping is dependent on the nature of relations that exist between individual BRICS+ member states.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, this piece narrows down the prospects thereof for bilateral cooperation of BRICS+ member states by giving special attention to South Africa/UAE relations. We seek to shed light on some of the areas in which South Africa should foster engagement with the UAE through the BRICS+ framework. We particularly pay special attention to illicit financial flows and the Gupta extradition case.\n\nOne of the immediate areas of engagement that BRICS expansion presents for South Africa and the UAE is on illicit financial flows (IFFs). IFFs as defined by the Internal Monetary Fund (IMF) are the \"movement of money across borders that is illegal in its source (e.g. corruption, smuggling), its transfer (e.g. tax evasion), or its use (e.g. terrorist financing)\".\n\nIFFs have significant adverse effects on the macroeconomies of countries where they originate, transit, and/or are integrated. According to the OECD, South Africa loses roughly between $3.5-billion and $5-billion to IFFs every year.\n\nThis estimate, which represents approximately 1-1.5% of South African annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP), is derived from estimates of between $40-billion and $54-billion in hidden South African-owned assets held in international financial centres (IFCs).\n\nThe country was listed in the 2022 Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) grey list (countries with high risks of IFFs) due to its failure to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. To this day, the country is still battling to get off the FATF list.\n\nThere is no doubt that IFFs deprive the country of the necessary financial resources needed to repay its debts and address internal socioeconomic challenges such as high levels of poverty, inequality, and unemployment, notwithstanding socioeconomic constraints posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the ongoing crisis in the Middle East.\n\nThe UAE is considered one of many enablers of global corruption, crime and IFFs. In 2022, the country was also grey-listed by both the FATF and the European Union (EU) amid risks associated with money laundering and terrorist financing relating to banks, precious metals and stones, as well as property. Matthew Page and Jodi Vittori argue that the UAE's prosperity is largely maintained by the relentless flow of illicit funds sourced from corruption and crime. The authors further argue that these proceeds have \"helped to fuel the emirate's booming real estate market; enrich its bankers, moneychangers, and business elites; and turn Dubai into a major gold trading hub\".\n\nSouth Africa and the UAE are party to the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC), which mandates that they cooperate with each other in ensuring that crimes related to corruption are prosecuted.\n\nIn 2018, the two countries also signed an extradition treaty that they both ratified in 2021. By definition, this meant that both states would be bound to deliver \"an accused or convicted person to the state where he is accused of, or has been convicted of, a crime by the state in which he is resident at the time\".\n\nHowever, in 2023, the UAE rejected South Africa's request to extradite Atul and Rajesh Gupta - State Capture-implicated brothers who fled South Africa while facing charges of money laundering and political corruption. This led to a diplomatic squabble between the two countries with South Africa's then Minister of Justice, Ronald Lamola, accusing the UAE of \"non-cooperation\", which he described as highly unprecedented in the arena of extradition requests.\n\nIt is crucial to highlight that the recent joint statement of the BRICS ministers of foreign affairs also reaffirms the group's commitment to \"promote BRICS cooperation in the prevention of and fight against corruption and continue to implement the relevant international agreements in this regard, in particular the United Nations Convention against Corruption\".\n\nTherefore, we believe that the BRICS+ forum creates an opportunity for dialogue and cooperation between South Africa and the UAE through the above-mentioned agreements and commitments.\n\nDespite the UAE's different view of South Africa's extradition request regarding the Gupta brothers, we believe that the spirit of dialogue and open communication reigns in BRICS. For instance, China and India are two BRICS countries whose border disputes and geopolitical tensions have received great attention from media and scholars.\n\nDespite their differences, there is no doubt that the BRICS+ forum has created room for dialogue and increased cooperation between the two countries. The most recent example is their bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the 15th BRICS Summit last year where both countries agreed to scale down tensions along their disputed border following another skirmish in late 2022. Even in the absence of the BRICS forums, the two counterparts have engaged in high-level meetings previously in a bid to put their differences aside.\n\nTherefore, the Gupta extradition case ought to be among the key points of bilateral engagement between South Africa and the UAE as a first step towards the advancement of meaningful dialogue and strong cooperation on combating IFFs.\n\nWhile many believe that tackling IFFs is a technical task that is too complicated, we argue that it is a matter of political will and strong international cooperation. This is proven by the African continent, which is leading the way in this effort - last year, an additional €1.69-billion was made in revenues through \"voluntary disclosures, information sharing mechanisms, and vigorous offshore investigation\".\n\nTherefore, such efforts and practices can be replicated by South Africa and the UAE through bilateral cooperation, and consequently championed within the overall BRICS+ grouping.

        "summary": "The article discusses the implications of the BRICS expansion for illicit financial flows (IFFs) and the extradition of the Gupta brothers, focusing on South Africa and the UAE. In August 2023, BRICS invited six new countries, including the UAE, to join from January 2024, forming BRICS+. This expansion offers opportunities for bilateral cooperation, particularly between South Africa and the UAE, to combat IFFs. Both countries face significant challenges with IFFs, which harm their economies. Despite an existing extradition treaty, the UAE rejected South Africa's request to extradite the Gupta brothers, leading to diplomatic tensions. The BRICS+ forum is seen as a platform to foster dialogue and cooperation on these issues. The authors argue that political will and international cooperation are crucial to addressing IFFs, citing successful efforts in Africa as a model.

        "body": "Kathmandu [Nepal], July 3 (ANI): After two days-long political drama, the incumbent government under Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal \"Prachanda\" has collapsed in Nepal as coalition ministers resign en-masse retracting support.\n\nWith the expiration of the 24-hour deadline given on Tuesday, the Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML), the key ally of the Dahal-led government walked out of the government. The party had given a one-day ultimatum to Prime Minister Dahal to step down from the post which it called \"a respectful exit.\"\n\nAlso Read | Pakistan: PTI Chief Imran Khan Seeks Permission From Rawalpindi Court To Meet His Sons, Qasim and Sulaiman, in Adiala Jail.\n\nOn Wednesday (July 3), eight ministers from CPN-UML on board the cabinet of Dahal formed on March 4 earlier this year, tendered resignations before the Prime Minister at his residence in Baluwatar. The ministers had reached Balkot, the residence of UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli and headed for Baluwatar.\n\n\"We have resigned and submitted the letter to the Prime Minister a while ago. All the 8 ministers on board the cabinet from the CPN-UML have resigned informing the Prime Minister that we no longer are part of this government and withdraw our support,\"\n\nAlso Read | Russia-Ukraine War: Russian Missiles and Drones Strike Dnipro in Daylight Attack, Killing at Least 5, Injuring 47.\n\nJwalakumari Sah, the former minister for Agriculture told ANI over phone call from PM residence, Baluwatar.\n\nThe UML and Congress on Monday night agreed to form a new government. Oli would lead a new national consensus and government for a year and a half. For the remaining term, Nepal's former PM Sher Bahadur Deuba will be the prime minister.\n\nDahal expressed reluctance to resign immediately. The office-bearers meeting of the CPN (Maoist Centre) held in Baluwatar on Tuesday had decided that the Prime Minister will not tender his resignation but instead face a trust vote in Parliament within 30 days since the retraction of support.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Nepali Congress formally endorsed the agreement reached with the CPN-UML on the formation of a new coalition. A central work execution committee meeting of the party held at party President Sher Bahadur Deuba's residence in Budhanilkantha endorsed the deal reached between the top leaders of the two largest parties.\n\nIn the deal, leaders from the two largest parties have reached an understanding to lead the governments in the remaining around three-and-half-year tenure of the present parliament on a rotation basis.\n\n\"The meeting concludes that it would be appropriate for the prime minister to pave the way for the formation of a new national consensus government as, following the agreement between Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, a clear majority in the House of Representatives is in favour of forming the government under the leadership of KP Sharma Oli,\" reads a statement issued after the meeting.\n\nThe meeting also expressed commitment to implement the agreement. \"The meeting expresses its determination to implement the agreement reached between the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML regarding leading governments on a rotation basis to protect national interests, control corruption, ensure good governance, the development, maintain political stability, amending the constitution to strengthen the federal democratic republican system and inclusiveness and to strengthen the economy.\"\n\nAs per the midnight agreement between Sher Bahadur Deuba from Nepali Congress and KP Sharma Oli from CPN-UML on Tuesday, a committee is also formed to suggest amendments to the election procedures and the constitution under the leadership of former Chief Justice Kalyan Shrestha.\n\nIn the overnight agreement, the largest and the second largest party in the parliament drafted a constitutional amendment agreement where it was stated that the Vice President would be made the chairman of the National Assembly. Leaders from the Congress and the UML informed President Ram Chandra Paudel about the change in coalition.\n\nDuring the meeting, the leaders informed the President about activating Section 76 (2) to form a new government in case the incumbent Prime Minister fails to win the vote of confidence after UML withdraws its support.\n\nPrachanda has to take the vote of confidence again from the parliament after a party withdraws support. Dahal, who came to power after the 2022 General Elections. has already taken the floor test in parliament for a record four times. (ANI)",

        "body": "NATO will roll out \"concrete ways\" to accelerate Ukraine's eventual membership in the Atlantic alliance during a summit next week in Washington, according to a senior U.S. official.\n\nSummit organizers are understood to be leaning toward language in a final declaration that would say Ukraine's path to NATO is \"irreversible,\" but the official would say only that the wording is still being negotiated.\n\nDouglas Jones, deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs, told VOA during an interview on Tuesday that foreign ministers from 35 non-NATO member partners are invited to attend the Washington summit.\n\nNotable attendees include the foreign ministers of Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nFor the third consecutive summit, heads of state from all 32 NATO allies will engage in discussions with leaders from its Indo-Pacific partners: Australia, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand.\n\nBuilding the resilience of allies to confront threats and challenges from China is among the key agenda items, said Jones. But, he added, a proposal to establish a NATO liaison office in Tokyo, intended as a hub for cooperation with Australia, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand, is currently \"not under active discussion.\"\n\nIn celebration of NATO's 75th anniversary, more than two dozen influencers have been invited to observe the proceedings and create social media content to commemorate the milestone.\n\nThe following excerpts from the interview have been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nVOA: Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban visited Kyiv on Tuesday and urged President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to consider a cease-fire with Russia. Are you concerned that this shows a divide in NATO? What is the U.S. perspective on Orban's visit to Ukraine?\n\nDouglas Jones, deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs: It's good that Prime Minister Orban visited Ukraine. On the idea of a cease-fire, these decisions are for Ukraine to make. We've always said, \"Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.\" It is up to Ukraine to decide when it's time to discuss a cease-fire and what the terms of any peace settlement might be.\n\nVOA: Moving on to NATO: What are the key items on the agenda? Are the foreign ministers of Israel and several Arab countries invited to the NATO summit?\n\nJones: We will be talking about the state of NATO. This summit is really about the future, about how NATO continues to transform and adapt itself to meet future challenges.\n\nWhether that's supporting Ukraine in its defense against Russian aggression, working with partners to build the resilience of allies to confront the threats and challenges from the People's Republic of China, or addressing hybrid and cyber threats, these are all issues that we'll be focusing on at the summit.\n\nNATO has a broad network of partnerships. There are 35 countries around the world that have a formal partnership relationship with NATO. They will all be invited at the level of foreign ministers to attend, including Israel and many countries in the Middle East.\n\nVOA: Zelenskyy is expected to attend next week's NATO summit. Does the U.S. view Ukraine's path to NATO membership as irreversible? Are the U.S. and its allies working to incorporate such language into NATO's joint statement?\n\nJones: The United States and all NATO allies have said that Ukraine's future is in NATO. At this summit, we will be rolling out concrete ways in which NATO can help Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression, build the future force needed to deter Russia, and implement the reforms it needs to make itself a stronger candidate for eventual NATO membership.\n\nTogether, this is what we describe as a bridge to NATO membership. The assistance that we're going to be rolling out at the summit will really help accelerate Ukraine on its path to NATO membership.\n\nVOA: And such a bridge is irreversible?\n\nJones: The wording of the declaration is still under negotiation by NATO allies. The alliance has already said that Ukraine will become a member of NATO.\n\nVOA: Regarding NATO's Indo-Pacific strategy, could you give us an update on the plan to open a NATO liaison office in Tokyo?\n\nJones: So, at the summit, the outcome with the Indo-Pacific partners is that all the heads of state and governments of NATO's Indo-Pacific partners -- Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand -- will be present. There are only three main meetings of the summit, and one of them will be when the heads of state of all 32 NATO allies meet with these Indo-Pacific partners. This is going to be the third summit in a row where this has happened.\n\nAnd the reason for that is because allies are increasingly recognizing that there are links between security in the Euro-Atlantic space and in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nUkraine is the No. 1 example where you have the biggest threat to transatlantic security, with Russia being fueled by assistance from China and the DPRK.\n\nVOA: Is there going to be a NATO office in Tokyo, or has such a plan been postponed indefinitely?\n\nJones: It's not under active discussion currently within the alliance.\n\nVOA: What can we expect from the NATO summit regarding the implications of the Russia-North Korea mutual defense pact?\n\nJones: Russia is seeking weapons from the DPRK as it looks for ways to continue its assault and aggression against Ukraine. The connections are deep. That's why we'll have the leaders of NATO's Indo-Pacific partners at the summit: to discuss how we can learn from each other and cooperate in addressing these common security challenges.",

        "body": "Released on Wednesday by the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU), the report explained the hardships civilians faced, including physical and long-term socioeconomic harm.\n\nIt also emphasised the human rights impact of Russia's renewed large-scale attacks on critical energy infrastructure in March, the ground offensive in the Kharkiv region in May and other developments in occupied and Government-controlled areas of Ukraine.\n\n\"With May having the highest monthly number of civilian casualties in nearly a year, fighting this spring took a horrific toll on civilians, particularly in Kharkiv region and city,\" said Danielle Bell, head of the HRMMU.\n\n\"The relentless attacks resulted in tragic loss of life, displacement, and destruction of homes and businesses,\" she added.\n\nAccording to the report, between 1 March and 31 May, at least 436 civilians were killed and a further 1,760 injured as a result of conflict-related violence. Casualties included six media workers, 26 employees of healthcare institutions, five humanitarian workers, and 28 emergency service workers.\n\nIt added that the majority (91 per cent) of the casualties occurred in territory controlled by Ukraine, and nine per cent in Russian-occupied territory.\n\nIn the reporting period, Russian authorities reported that 91 civilians were killed and 455 injured in the Russia from attacks launched by Ukrainian armed forces, primarily in Belgorod, Briansk, and Kursk regions.\n\nUN monitors identified the use of powerful air-dropped bombs and missiles in populated areas and at least five instances of successive attacks on the same location, just as first responders arrived on the scene, causing casualties.\n\nThe spring escalation in hostilities also saw Russian armed forces launch their \"largest campaign of attacks\" against critical energy infrastructure since the winter of 2022-23, killing and injuring civilians, while also affecting millions of people across the country with power cuts, the report said.\n\nThe attacks also had rippling consequences on water supplies, mobile and internet access, and public transportation, Ms. Bell noted.\n\n\"The full impact of the attacks on energy infrastructure will only be clear this upcoming winter when the reduced power-generating capacity of Ukraine could leave many without access to heating and other services necessary for their survival,\" she said.\n\nAmong other findings, the report noted that the Russian armed forces pressured civilians in occupied territory to get Russian citizenship to receive medical services and keep their property rights.\n\nThe report will be presented to the Geneva-based Human Rights Council on 9 July.\n\nOn Wednesday, the President of the UN General Assembly completed a two-day official visit to Kyiv, where he met with several official leaders including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nIn his discussions Assembly President Dennis Francis stressed that the Russian aggression against Ukraine violated the UN Charter.\n\nHe reiterated the General Assembly's commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.\n\nMr. Francis also noted that the Organization has worked closely with the Government, local authorities and international partners to rebuild Ukraine from the destruction.\n\n\"I would like to think the darkest of the night is behind Ukraine, not ahead of it,\" he said, expressing hope that the recent Summit for Peace in Ukraine would bring further progress in the near future.",

At least 436 civilians were killed and 1,760 injured during this period, with the majority of casualties occurring in Ukrainian-controlled areas. The report also noted the use of powerful bombs and missiles in populated areas and attacks on first responders. The destruction of energy infrastructure has had widespread effects on power, water, and communication services, with potential severe consequences for the upcoming winter. Additionally, Russian forces pressured civilians in occupied territories to obtain Russian citizenship for access to medical services and property rights. The report will be presented to the Human Rights Council on July 9. Concurrently, UN General Assembly President Dennis Francis visited Kyiv, reaffirming support for Ukraine's sovereignty and condemning Russian aggression."

        "title": "World News | Harris Tries to Hold the Line for Biden as Democrats Panic over Election | LatestLY",
        "body": "Washington, Jul 3 (AP) By the time Vice President Kamala Harris stepped into her third fundraiser since President Joe Biden's disastrous debate last week, she had her routine down.\n\nYes, she conceded to a few dozen donors in San Francisco, the president's performance was \"not his finest hour.\" However, she said, \"the outcome of this election cannot be determined by one day in June.\"\n\nAlso Read | Pakistan: PTI Chief Imran Khan Seeks Permission From Rawalpindi Court To Meet His Sons, Qasim and Sulaiman, in Adiala Jail.\n\nIt's not the kind of rhetorical two-step that any running mate would want to be practicing just over four months before the election, but Harris has little choice. She's trying to help Biden stave off a death spiral in their campaign for a second term after the 81-year-old president's faltering debate appearance magnified concerns about his ability to beat Donald Trump and serve another four years.\n\nThe moment could hardly be more delicate for the 59-year-old Harris, who is the first woman, Black person and person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president. Although some Democrats have pointed to her as a logical successor if Biden steps aside, others are drawing up wish lists of potential replacements that don't include her on the ticket at all.\n\nAlso Read | Russia-Ukraine War: Russian Missiles and Drones Strike Dnipro in Daylight Attack, Killing at Least 5, Injuring 47.\n\nDepending on how the coming days and weeks unfold, her work on Biden's behalf could lead to a political dead end, or secure her future within the party by providing fresh opportunities to prove her doubters wrong.\n\nChad Griffin, a member of the campaign's national finance committee, said the White House was fortunate to have a vice president that is \"tough as nails\" and \"out there defending the president and talking about the stakes of this election.\"\n\n\"They're a team,\" he said. \"And we're increasingly seeing the other half of that team.\"\n\nA wounded Biden appears to be pulling Harris closer. They were scheduled to have one of their occasional private lunches on Wednesday, and the vice president was belatedly added to the schedule for his Fourth of July celebration at the White House on Thursday.\n\nRisks and rewards as Harris elevated\n\nNone of this comes without political danger for Democrats. Harris' favorability ratings are low, and she's a frequent target for Republicans, who say she's waiting in the wings in case Biden isn't able to complete a second term. \"Vote Joe Biden today, get Kamala Harris tomorrow,\" said an advertisement from Trump's campaign.\n\nBut for now, Harris is Biden's top advocate as he faces calls to shake up his campaign or end his reelection effort. Her presence has been a balm for some anxious Democrats, such as the donors who gathered for a fundraiser in Los Angeles on Saturday.\n\nHarris paced the stage with a handheld mic -- Biden sometimes uses teleprompters even during fundraisers -- as she acknowledged \"the elephant in the room,\" meaning Thursday's debate. Then she swung her focus to Trump, who she described as a liar and a threat to democracy.\n\n\"You see how much hasn't changed?\" Harris said. \"So, let's deal with what we've got, right?\"\n\nGriffin said \"there was this sigh of relief\" from donors afterward. Some said \"we want to see more of that\" or \"the gloves are really off.\"\n\nOnly 39% of U.S. adults have a favorable view of Harris, which is in line with Biden's 40%, according to an AP-NORC poll conducted in June. However, her unfavorable rating is 49%, lower than Biden's 57%, and 12% said they weren't familiar enough with Harris to have an opinion of her.\n\nThe numbers mean there's risk and reward in spotlighting Harris, with room for public opinion to swing in either direction.\n\nNext in line for the presidency\n\nThere's no easy way for Democrats to force Biden to relinquish the nomination, which is scheduled to be finalized with a virtual vote before the party's convention in Chicago in August. There's also no precedent for a major party presidential candidate to drop out of the race at this point.\n\nBut if Biden steps aside, there's a wide array of Democrats who are primed for a shot at the White House, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nHowever, there are clear advantages for Harris. Under campaign finance rules, she could easily tap the money that's been raised for Biden's reelection. She also has hard-to-obtain foreign policy experience, after crisscrossing the globe on the White House's behalf and meeting with dozens of world leaders.\n\nSome have called for Democrats to nominate Harris or at least accept her as Biden's clear successor.\n\nFormer Rep. Tim Ryan, who fell short in his campaign for a Senate seat in Ohio, said that \"it's time\" for Harris to replace Biden on the ticket and provide \"generational change.\"\n\nRep. Jim Clyburn, an influential Democrat from the key primary state of South Carolina and a co-chair of Biden's campaign, said he would back Harris if the president wasn't in the race.\n\n\"This party should not, in any way, do anything to work around Ms. Harris,\" he told MSNBC. \"We should do everything we can to bolster her, whether it's in second place or at the top of the ticket.\"\n\nThe vice presidency can be a trap for ambitious politicians, and they're more likely to ascend to the presidency because of death than get elected on their own.\n\nOftentimes they're too closely tied to the current administration to represent a path forward, or voters are accustomed to seeing them as a sidekick rather than a leader, said Joel K. Goldstein, a vice presidential historian.\n\n\"The vice presidency is the best springboard,\" he said. \"But being vice president doesn't mean that you're going to automatically get the nomination, or going to get the nomination without an effort.\"\n\nDuring an interview with The Associated Press last year, Harris dismissed the idea of her replacing Biden as \"hypothetical,\" saying \"Joe Biden is going to be fine, so that is not going to come to fruition.\"\n\nHowever, she said every vice president has needed to be ready to step in if necessary.\n\nHarris and Biden advisers said the vice president's role hasn't shifted since the debate. She was already leading outreach to key demographic groups, such as Black people and young voters, and pushing for reproductive rights after the Supreme Court ended the nationwide right to abortion.\n\nHarris has also helped Biden fend off questions about his age before, such as when special counsel Robert Hur released his report on the president's handling of classified documents. Although Hur concluded that no criminal charges were warranted, he described Biden as a \"well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\"\n\nThe following day, Harris called Hur's report \"gratuitous, inaccurate and inappropriate.\"\n\nBut there's no question that the spotlight on Harris has brightened since the debate. A preview came on Thursday shortly after the debate ended.\n\nHer team had previously arranged for a series of television interviews, which is standard practice for big moments like the State of the Union. But as Biden faltered, it quickly became apparent that Harris would be the White House's first line of defense.\n\nShe conferred with Biden's braintrust, which was in Atlanta for the debate, and told them that she was going to say that the president had \"a slow start\" but a \"strong finish,\" according to a person with knowledge of the conversation.\n\nThat description was an understatement but one of the first concessions that Biden did poorly. Harris also helped set the tone for the campaign's response to the debate by attacking Trump as having \"lied over and over and over again\" and shifting the focus to Biden's overall record.\n\n\"I'm not gonna spend all night with you talking about the last 90 minutes when I've been watching the last 3.5 years of performance,\" she said.\n\nThe interviews drew some over-the-top praise from commentators who compared Harris' coherence with Biden's convoluted and sometimes nonsensical answers. That drew some eyerolls from Harris allies.\n\nThe vice president \"has been right under their nose,\" said Jamal Simmons, Harris' former communications director. \"This is who she is.\"\n\n\"People who are on Team Harris are very familiar with her being underestimated,\" he said.

Despite her low favorability ratings, Harris is actively defending Biden and addressing key issues, such as reproductive rights and outreach to key demographic groups. Her increased visibility and role in the campaign could either bolster her political future or lead to a dead end, depending on the outcome. Key figures supporting Harris include Chad Griffin and Rep. Jim Clyburn, while potential Democratic contenders include Governors Gavin Newsom, J.B. Pritzker, and Gretchen Whitmer. Harris' ability to navigate this period is crucial for her political trajectory and the Democratic Party's strategy."

The residents also raised the issue of inadequate compensation being granted to the people who had sold their lands for the proposed developmental projects.\n\nAlso Read | Pakistan: PTI Chief Imran Khan Seeks Permission From Rawalpindi Court To Meet His Sons, Qasim and Sulaiman, in Adiala Jail.\n\nThe locals have stated that the work has remained halted for at least a month and the locals have been facing severe problems relating to transportation and managing essentials for the Minapin area as the damaged roads and poor surrounding infrastructure cause travel-related problems for locals and tourists, Pamir Times reported.\n\nWhile raising his concerns over these issues, the local village head, Iqbal said, \"We had tried everything when we were demanding the redevelopment of this village and the surrounding areas. After several hardships, the administration finally agreed to redevelop our area.\"\n\nAlso Read | Russia-Ukraine War: Russian Missiles and Drones Strike Dnipro in Daylight Attack, Killing at Least 5, Injuring 47.\n\n\"In response, our local landowners sold their lands for mere pennies. Several shops were destroyed, several trees were cut and several local businesses were shifted, but now when it is the time to reap the fruits of their sacrifice, the administration has stopped the development work entirely. It has been over two months and we have requested all the authorities to respond but no one has responded.\"\n\nHe further said that residents have sacrificed their businesses, shops and lands for the betterment of the village. However, the people have received nothing in return.\n\nIqbal said, \"These local people who have lost their businesses, shops and lands for the betterment of the village what will they do now? And an addition to that is the government's slow speed in allocating compensation of lands, I have heard that this compensation was given to the district collector's office years ago but, I don't know why it has still not reached the right people.\"\n\nHe also mentioned that compensation for several other major highway projects like the Ghaizer Expressway, Navtar Expressway, and Chilas-Diame-Bhasha Dam had also been allotted to the authorities a long time ago. However, the work on the highway projects is not over yet and is causing a lot of problems for locals, both financially and logistically as the locals depend on tourism during the winter season which is just around the corner in Pakistan-occupied Gilgit Baltistan.\n\nExpressing concern over the condition of the tourism sector in the region, he said, \"The hotels that give us a major part of our income are empty because they are not able to reach our village and the Minapin Valley. We urge that the administration must act fast and keep their part of the bargain, as we have suffered a lot of loss when we gave our lands to the administration. But we will not take the damage this time, and will come out on the streets if our demands are not met.\" (ANI)\n\n(This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)",

        "title": "What Did Chinese Analysts Think of the Kim-Putin Summit in Pyongyang?",
        "body": "Commentators in China have very different takeaways from the Kim-Putin embrace in Pyongyang than their counterparts in the U.S.\n\nVoices from the United States, South Korea, and Japan claim Russian President Vladimir Putin's recent day-long state visit to North Korea has put Beijing in an awkward position. What did analysts from China think?\n\nOfficials in Beijing described the wide-ranging agreements between the two \"friendly and close neighbors\" as fulfilling the \"the legitimate need for exchanges, cooperation and development of relations.\" Scholars across China focused largely on Putin and Kim signing a long-awaited agreement on the construction of the Tumen River cross-border bridge - an issue that has largely gone unreported in the global media.\n\nThe only thing the U.S. and its allies on one hand and China on the other hand can agree upon is that Putin's visit to Pyongyang to revive the decades-long socialist brethren \"alliance\" between North Korea and Russia (and before that, the Soviet Union) was necessitated by Russia's geopolitical isolation and weakness - an outcome of the all-out Russian war on Ukraine. As the 28 months since February 2022 have shown, the invasion carries different significance for China, North Korea, and Russia, respectively. Yet the re-alliance between Moscow and Pyongyang is being viewed by many in China as beneficial to the great cause of opposing U.S. hegemony.\n\nWhat the U.S. Thinks China Thinks\n\nWithin hours of the signing of a new defense treaty between Russia and North Korea, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told his South Korean counterpart Cho Tae-yul by telephone that he condemned growing North Korea-Russia military cooperation. A couple of days later, Blinken's deputy, Kurt Campbell, said that Beijing was \"somewhat anxious\" over growing military cooperation between Russia and North Korea. \"I think it is fair to say that China is somewhat anxious about what's going on between Russia and North Korea. They have indicated so in some of our interactions, and we can see some tension associated with this,\" Campbell said in a keynote address at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nUnderstandably, there are specific reasons for the extraordinary Western attention on Putin's visit to North Korea and for the heightened concerns in the West regarding military cooperation between \"belligerent\" Russia and \"rogue\" North Korea. In China, on the contrary, Beijing has officially not reacted much - neither to express concerns nor to welcome the defense pact. The only official comment came from Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong, who said in a statement: \"As friendly neighbors, North Korea and Russia have normal needs for exchanges and relationship development, and their high-level engagement are bilateral arrangements between two sovereign states.\"\n\nInterestingly, it seems the central authorities in Beijing would rather have China's Russia experts and others belonging to the country's strategic community chip in and provide China's perspective.\n\nOf course, there are quite a few scholars who are apprehensive that Russia's \"go east\" policy might force Beijing to be watchful lest the growing Russian presence - not, it should be noted, the new defense treaty specifically - potentially cause \"instability\" in the situation in the Korean Peninsula. Yet analysts across China, affiliated with a wide spectrum of think tanks and university departments, have been mostly positive in their responses to Putin embracing North Korea, for three reasons: the perfect timing of Putin-Kim summit in Pyongyang; the opportunity for Beijing to improve relations with Brussels; and, most importantly, Putin keeping his word to Beijing by signing an agreement with Kim for early construction of cross-border highway bridge on the Tumen River.\n\n'Perfect' Timing of Putin-Kim Summit\n\nWhat is most interesting about Putin's sudden decision to visit North Korea, as noted in several Chinese commentaries, is that Moscow and Pyongyang started negotiating the specific date as recently as a week prior to the visit. This explains why most China watchers globally were literally caught sleeping as Vladimir Putin landed in the North Korean capital in the wee hours at 3 a.m. on Wednesday, June 19. This also means the Russian leader actually was in North Korea just for a day, and not a two-day visit as was mostly reported prior to the trip.\n\nWhy would Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un stay up until three in the morning to personally pick up a visiting foreign leader at the airport?\n\nBecause the foreign leader happened to be the Russian president, whom Kim had earlier hailed as \"invincible comrade-in-arms.\" The North Korean leader also maintains that his country's relationship with Putin-led Russia is at the highest point today, even comparable to the heyday of the alliance between North Korea and the former Soviet Union.\n\nHowever, if what commentators in China say is true, then Putin had decided to delay his arrival in Pyongyang - without telling Kim. Further, Chinese analysts believe Putin's decision was taken in order to avoid any adverse impact on the ongoing China-Japan-South Korea tripartite communication on the one hand and more importantly, from Beijing's point of view, a fresh round of Beijing-Seoul bilateral diplomatic and security dialogue taking place at the same time.\n\nA commentary on the popular digital platform sohu.com provided a full account of the supposed background of how Moscow worked out the specific dates of Putin's Pyongyang in consultation with Beijing. The commentary said that, both in order to avoid Kim and Putin sharing an \"embrace\" in Pyongyang on June 18 - the same day China and South Korea were to hold their first ever vice-ministerial security and diplomacy 2+2 meeting in Seoul - and to \"give face to Kim Jong Un,\" Putin made an unscheduled, over 5-hour stop in Yakutsk, the capital of Russia's Sakha Republic, for an inspection, taking photos and chatting with local people. As a result, he did not arrive in Pyongyang until three in the morning on June 19.\n\nThis delay also helped Beijing avoid explaining to Seoul why China was \"silent\" over the Russian involvement (along with North Korea) in endangering the security situation on the peninsula, as Putin didn't begin his visit until after the 2+2 had concluded.\n\nThe Pros and Cons of Putin's Visit to North Korea for China\n\nWhile the Russia-North Korea Treaty of Comprehensive Strategic Partnership signed between Putin and Kim last month is causing concern and drawing global attention - especially in the West and in Japan and in South Korea - the same treaty is being cited by most scholars and experts in China as the reason to welcome the increasing cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang. China's official Xinhua news agency hailed the treaty as the upgrading of Russia-North Korea relations in a commentary on June 22, and most scholarly accounts of the development have pointed out quite a few advantages for Beijing.\n\nFirst, Beijing sees the North Korea-Russia treaty as working to its benefit, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, as it is making the United States concerned or even frightened. Analysts approvingly called Russia and North Korea moving closer as a \"rational choice.\" Second, North Korea providing ammunition to Russia means that China can scale back certain trade with Russia and thereby improve China-EU relations, as European countries have repeatedly raised Chinese exports of dual-use goods to Russia as a major concern. Third, Chinese commentators claim that North Korea's mass export of ammunition to Russia could actually help improve stability on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nEchoing sentiments of many in China's strategic affairs community that the Kim-Putin summit was driven by the pressure and aggression of U.S. imperialism and its NATO allies, Wang Junsheng, a research fellow of East Asian studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, said this visit was sure to bring Russia-North Korea relations to new heights. \"Due to NATO's expansion in Europe and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the U.S.-led military alliances in Northeast Asia targeting Pyongyang, the deeper cooperation between Russia and North Korea is no surprise,\" Wang noted.\n\nSeveral Chinese scholars expressed the view that the long-standing strategy of the United States and its allies to isolate and suppress Russia and North Korea will automatically push them to work together to deal with the common threat from U.S.-led alliances, whether in Europe or Northeast Asia.\n\nAt another level, it has also been observed that although China, Russia, and North Korea are viewed as sharing a hostility to the U.S.-led international order, Beijing is not only aware but also very careful not to jeopardize the fact that it is less globally ostracized than the other two countries. Hence, as the sohu.com commentary already mentioned noted, North Korea-Russia rapprochement will help China balance or even improve relations with Europe on one hand, and on the other hand it will deplete North Korea's arsenal, which in turn will help Beijing's efforts to maintain peace and stability in Northeast Asia.\n\nThe Significance of a New Bridge on the Tumen River\n\nAs mentioned, in China, the signing of an agreement between Putin and Kim for early construction of a cross-border bridge across the Tumen River has been seen as more important news than the Russia-North Korea Comprehensive Strategic Partnership defense treaty. As noted in a Chinese commentary, this reflects Putin's current high attention to China's desires. Another Chinese commentary highlighted that \"when Putin visited China on May 16, he promised the Chinese leaders to talk to North Korea about the Tumen River estuary. This time he went to Pyongyang to discuss it. The two sides came up with a plan to build a new bridge.\"\n\nCurrently, the sole link between Russia and North Korea across the Tumen River is an old railway bridge, which is so small that it effectively blocks use of the river by commercial vessels.\n\nThe Kim-Putin agreement on building a new bridge over the Tumen River has been trending among the topmost issues on the largest Chinese social media platform, WeChat. However, skeptics have been less than hopeful of an early implementation of the agreement. The reasons, unsurprisingly, have a lot to do with China's colonial past and the \"century of humiliation.\" Historically speaking, the area in China's northeast bordering Russia, North Korea, and the Sea of Japan, had fallen into the hands of Imperial Russia following the Treaty of Peking after the occupation of Beijing by French and British troops in 1860. Today, a sliver of Russian territory separates China from the Sea of Japan - and gives Russia a direct land border with North Korea, marked by the Tumen River.\n\nThe region was deadlocked in China-USSR hostility following the Sino-Soviet split. In the post-Soviet era, both North Korea and Russia remained wary of Chinese hegemony and \"expansionism.\" But following Chinese market reform and opening up policies, Beijing has been relentlessly pushing for access to the Tumen River and through it to the Sea of Japan. Backed by Russia, Japan, the two Koreas and Mongolia, in 1991 and in 1995, China successfully rallied the United Nations Development Program, leading to the establishment of Tumen River Regional Development Plan (TRRDP) and Tumen River Area Development Program (TRADP), respectively. However, due to internal frictions in Russia and Japanese and South Korean suspicions about the role of North Korea, the TRADP project never really took off.\n\nMore recently, China-North Korea announced in 2014 the construction of a new bridge in the Tumen River basin connecting Hunchun in China to Sonbong-guyok in North Korea will be completed by the end of 2015. Work was still ongoing in 2019, before North Korea shut its borders and all related infrastructure projects, amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAs observed in Japan's Nikkei Asia, factors such as the \"new Cold War,\" Pyongyang's ever-increasing appetite for nuclear weapons, growing friction between the two Koreas, and Japanese \"insecurity\" vis-à-vis fast expanding Chinese military might all served as obstacles in China's long cherished desire to access the Sea of Japan through the Russia-North Korea river border.\n\nScholars in China might have been excited with the Tumen River cross-border bridge agreement in Pyongyang, but they are unable to forget the disillusionment that has accumulated over the past several decades. Agreement after agreement has been quietly ignored, preventing China from fulfilling its wish to connect China's northeast to Rajin in North Korea and hence access the Sea of Japan - which is a mere 15 kilometers past the Soviet-era bridge that currently blocks the river. Chinese analysts are thus closely watching North Korea-Russia relations for its potential to achieve three of China's goals: improve relations with Europe, deplete North Korea's arsenal, and bring about the long-awaited construction of a cross-border bridge across the Tumen River.",

        "summary": "The recent summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang has elicited varied reactions from Chinese analysts compared to their Western counterparts.

The summit's timing was strategically planned to avoid clashing with China-South Korea diplomatic meetings. The new Russia-North Korea defense treaty is seen as advantageous for China, potentially improving stability on the Korean Peninsula and allowing China to scale back certain trade with Russia, thereby improving relations with Europe.\n\nThe Tumen River bridge agreement is particularly significant for China, reflecting Putin's attention to Chinese interests. However, there is skepticism about the project's early implementation due to historical and geopolitical challenges. Chinese analysts are closely monitoring the Russia-North Korea relationship for its potential to achieve China's goals of improving relations with Europe, depleting North Korea's arsenal, and constructing the long-awaited bridge."

        "title": "MIL-OSI Global: Ukraine war: Kyiv rejects Orbán ceasefire plan but global security deals offer...",
        "body": "Source: The Conversation - UK - By Stefan Wolff, Professor of International Security, University of Birmingham\n\nUkraine has firmly ruled out any compromises in its war with Russia, according to a senior aide to President Volodymyr Zelensky. Andriy Yermak, the Ukrainian president's chief of staff, said that while Kyiv welcomed advice on how to reach a \"just peace\", Ukraine is \"not ready to go to the compromise for the very important things and values ... independence, freedom, democracy, territorial integrity, sovereignty\".\n\nYermak's comments came a day after Viktor Orbán, the Hungarian prime minister suggested that Kyiv should agree a ceasefire with Moscow. Orbán, who is known to be close to Vladimir Putin and who has just taken over the rotating presidency of the European Council, raised the idea during his first wartime visit to Kyiv on July 2.\n\nOrbán has been the most sceptical of the EU leaders when it comes to European financial and military support for Ukraine. He was instrumental in delaying the agreement of a €50 billion (£42 billion) aid package for several months earlier this year.\n\nBut, despite Orbán's reticence, the EU recently agreed a bilaterial security pact with Zelensky while he visited Brussels on June 27. Under the terms of the deal, \"the European Union and its\n\nMember States will contribute, for the long term and together with partners, to security commitments to Ukraine, which will help Ukraine to defend itself, resist destabilisation efforts and deter acts of aggression in the future\".\n\nThe EU deal is the latest of 20 such bilateral agreements, including with the US and major European powers. But while they represent a show of support for Ukraine, they fall short of providing actual security guarantees. None of Kyiv's partners are willing to deploy troops for the country's defence, primarily because this is seen as a pathway to escalation into a full-scale confrontation between Russia and Nato.\n\nSo none of these security agreements are therefore likely to deter Putin in his war of aggression. But they are far from ineffective or useless. They provide ten-year commitments to train and equip Ukraine's armed forces, to strengthen the country's defence industrial base and to contribute to its economic recovery.\n\nAt the same time, they reiterate the need for Russian leaders to be held accountable and for sanctions against Moscow to be maintained, and if necessary extended. All of this sends a clear signal that Ukraine's western partners are serious about their support.\n\nBeyond the symbolism of the sheer number of agreements, they have also had positive practical consequences for Ukraine. Kyiv's ground offensive last year may have failed to liberate much territory, but Ukraine's forces have decimated the Russian Black Sea fleet. It has had to relocate from its traditional base in Sevastopol to sites on the Russian mainland.\n\nThis has decreased the risk of any seaborne landing by Russian forces on Ukraine's Black Sea coast and has allowed Kyiv to establish a secure maritime trade corridor in the western Black Sea to enable its agricultural exports.\n\nSimilarly, Ukrainian drones have been able to reach deeper and deeper into Russian territory and attack military bases, supply routes and energy infrastructure there.\n\nTogether with fewer restrictions on the use of advanced military systems against Russian territory, Ukraine has gradually improved its position on the ground.\n\nThis can, and should, not detract from the fact that Russia has made gains in the land war and continues to do so while also targeting Ukraine's critical national infrastructure. But it does indicate that for as long as western support is forthcoming, it is unlikely that Putin's aggression will succeed.\n\nBut, for all its heroism in the field, Ukraine is very far from establishing a clear pathway to victory. Russias' economy remains resilient, Moscow continues to mobilise more troops than Kyiv, and its alliances with Iran, North Korea, and China are giving it valuable economic, military and diplomatic cover.\n\nIt is not clear how long Russia can maintain this position of at least relative strength. But neither is it clear that Ukraine's situation will continue to improve.\n\nA return of Donald Trump to the White House after the US presidential elections in November 2024 - at present looking increasingly likely - would bring with it a resurgence of Trump's so-called \"America-first\" foreign policy. The US would then probably try to force Ukraine - and its other western partners - to accept Russian terms in a negotiated settlement.\n\nWithout any real, hard security guarantees for Ukraine in such a settlement, Kyiv would find itself back where it was a decade ago. Faced with Russian occupation of Crimea and large chunks of eastern Ukraine - and with lukewarm support from the west - it had to rely on a worthless \"agreement\" with Russia and no assurances against further Russian aggression.\n\nBut this isn't a foregone conclusion, whatever the outcomes of November's presidential election. On the contrary, the multiple security agreements that Ukraine has signed over the past few months also make an alternative future conceivable.\n\nIt's a future in which, with western help, Kyiv can demonstrate the futility of Russian aggression by regaining more territory and provide more effective air defences for its population and infrastructure. Western military aid, and the permission to strike at Russian military bases will help disrupt the supply lines that have enabled Russia's battlefield victories.\n\nIn this case, Putin is unlikely to look like the kind of winner that Trump likes to back. This calculation creates a window of opportunity for Ukraine's western partners over the next six or so months to double down on, and accelerate, their support for Kyiv and future-proof what ultimately might turn out a winning strategy in a war of attrition after all.\n\nStefan Wolff is a past recipient of grant funding from the Natural Environment Research Council of the UK, the United States Institute of Peace, the Economic and Social Research Council of the UK, the British Academy, the NATO Science for Peace Programme, the EU Framework Programmes 6 and 7 and Horizon 2020, as well as the EU's Jean Monnet Programme.

In addition, the call of CPJ to the Public Security Department of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region regarding the safety of the journalists had also gone unanswered.\n\nPreviously, CPJ in a report released in 2023 found out that China remains the worst place when it comes to arresting journalists, especially from ethnic minorities.\n\nAccording to CPJ's latest annual prison census, with at least 44 behind bars as of December 1, 2023.

CPJ has not received information on the charges but suspects Koben's arrest may be linked to his work on historic buildings in Xinjiang. CPJ's China representative, Iris Hsu, urged Chinese authorities to stop harassing and detaining journalists from Muslim ethnic minorities. CPJ's 2023 report highlights China as the worst country for journalist arrests, particularly targeting ethnic minorities like Uyghurs. International bodies have accused China of severe human rights violations and genocide in Xinjiang."

        "title": "Russia Freaked: The U.S. Navy Surfaced a Seawolf-Class Submarine as a",
        "body": "Summary and Key Points: The U.S. Navy's Seawolf-class submarines, developed at the end of the Cold War, were designed to counter Soviet threats. Despite budget constraints limiting the fleet to three vessels, these submarines boast sophisticated undersea warfare technology.\n\n-The Navy has used public displays of the Seawolf-class, such as surfacing in Norway in 2020, to deter Russian aggression. The class includes USS Seawolf, USS Connecticut, and USS Jimmy Carter, each with unique capabilities.\n\n-These submarines are armed with advanced torpedoes and missiles, and could potentially be showcased in the future to deter further hostilities from adversaries.\n\nDesigned at the tail end of the Cold War, the U.S. Navy's Seawolf-class submarines were built to surpass the capabilities of their Soviet counterparts.\n\nWhile budgetary constraints and the collapse of the USSR led to the cancellation of the full planned fleet of vessels, the three Seawolf ships constructed continue to wow naval experts and scare U.S. adversaries. In fact, the Navy's Seawolf ships carry some of the most sophisticated undersea warfare technology ever developed.\n\nAlthough submarines usually remain silent and stealthy, in order to demonstrate their ability to strike from any corner of the world, the Navy has intentionally surfaced them as a show of force to adversaries.\n\nIn 2020, the service made public displays of its nuclear submarines in Norway in an effort to deter Russian hostility in the region. On Aug. 21, 2020, USS Seawolf parked off the coast of Tromso to take on new crew members. The U.S. and Norway use this strategic port off the coast of Tromso to keep an eye on Moscow's Northern Fleet. According to senior naval officials, \"the U.S. and Norway have a great relationship, and our ability to use facilities in and around Tromso would provide a strategic location for our visits,\" adding that \"It would give us flexibility for not only the U.S. but allied countries to exercise in the High North.\"\n\nUSS Seawolf, like its two sister ships, was developed in the late Cold War. The Navy required a new sub class capable of countering the USSR's Typhoon class of ballistic missile submarines. Engineers designed the Seawolf ships to be quieter and faster than their predecessors. The lead ship of the class, USS Seawolf, was ordered in 1989 from the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics. USS Connecticut was commissioned a decade later, followed by USS Jimmy Carter in 2004.\n\nIn 2021, Connecticut was severely damaged after colliding with a seamount while sailing in the South China Sea. Fortunately, no sailors were killed in the incident, but the submarine has remained out of commission since this mishap. The Navy expects to return Connecticut to service in 2025.\n\nUSS Jimmy Carter was developed with distinct modifications, making the submarine essentially a new class when compared to its two sister ships. The Navy uniquely designed Jimmy Carter for covert surveillance and special operations missions.\n\nAccording to Business Insider, Jimmy Carter included \"special thrusters fore and aft that allow the sub to remain stationary underwater, as well as a 100-ft hull extension known as the Multi-Mission Platform, which increased its length to 435 feet and its fully submerged displacement 12,158 tons.\" Jimmy Carter can float above undersea communications cables and physically cut into them, which enables the submarine to intercept the data streams running through them.\n\nThe Navy's Seawolf-class ships are typically armed with 533mm Mark 48 torpedoes, in addition to Harpoon anti-ship missiles and Tomahawk cruise missiles. A Tercom-Aided Inertial Navigation System guides each missile toward its intended target. While the Tomahawk can be fitted with a nuclear warhead, these submarines rarely carry these types of munitions.\n\nAs detailed by Naval Technology, \"Block III improvements include an improved propulsion system and Navstar global positioning system (GPS) guidance capability. The anti-ship Tomahawk missile is equipped with inertial guidance and an active radar and anti-radiation homing head. The range is up to 450km.\"\n\nAs Russia's invasion of Ukraine rages on, the U.S. and its NATO allies are constantly working to deter additional hostilities in the region. Showcasing the strength and capability of the U.S. submarine fleet via surprise surfacing missions could remind the Kremlin of the consequences of extending the war further.",

        "title": "Ukraine war: Kyiv rejects Orbán ceasefire plan but global security deals offer hope",
        "body": "University of Birmingham provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation UK.\n\nUkraine has firmly ruled out any compromises in its war with Russia, according to a senior aide to President Volodymyr Zelensky. Andriy Yermak, the Ukrainian president's chief of staff, said that while Kyiv welcomed advice on how to reach a \"just peace\", Ukraine is \"not ready to go to the compromise for the very important things and values ... independence, freedom, democracy, territorial integrity, sovereignty\".\n\nYermak's comments came a day after Viktor Orbán, the Hungarian prime minister suggested that Kyiv should agree a ceasefire with Moscow. Orbán, who is known to be close to Vladimir Putin and who has just taken over the rotating presidency of the European Council, raised the idea during his first wartime visit to Kyiv on July 2.\n\nOrbán has been the most sceptical of the EU leaders when it comes to European financial and military support for Ukraine. He was instrumental in delaying the agreement of a €50 billion (£42 billion) aid package for several months earlier this year.\n\nBut, despite Orbán's reticence, the EU recently agreed a bilaterial security pact with Zelensky while he visited Brussels on June 27. Under the terms of the deal, \"the European Union and its Member States will contribute, for the long term and together with partners, to security commitments to Ukraine, which will help Ukraine to defend itself, resist destabilisation efforts and deter acts of aggression in the future\".\n\nThe EU deal is the latest of 20 such bilateral agreements, including with the US and major European powers. But while they represent a show of support for Ukraine, they fall short of providing actual security guarantees. None of Kyiv's partners are willing to deploy troops for the country's defence, primarily because this is seen as a pathway to escalation into a full-scale confrontation between Russia and Nato.\n\nSo none of these security agreements are therefore likely to deter Putin in his war of aggression. But they are far from ineffective or useless. They provide ten-year commitments to train and equip Ukraine's armed forces, to strengthen the country's defence industrial base and to contribute to its economic recovery.\n\nAt the same time, they reiterate the need for Russian leaders to be held accountable and for sanctions against Moscow to be maintained, and if necessary extended. All of this sends a clear signal that Ukraine's western partners are serious about their support.\n\nBeyond the symbolism of the sheer number of agreements, they have also had positive practical consequences for Ukraine. Kyiv's ground offensive last year may have failed to liberate much territory, but Ukraine's forces have decimated the Russian Black Sea fleet. It has had to relocate from its traditional base in Sevastopol to sites on the Russian mainland.\n\nThis has decreased the risk of any seaborne landing by Russian forces on Ukraine's Black Sea coast and has allowed Kyiv to establish a secure maritime trade corridor in the western Black Sea to enable its agricultural exports.\n\nSimilarly, Ukrainian drones have been able to reach deeper and deeper into Russian territory and attack military bases, supply routes and energy infrastructure there.\n\nTogether with fewer restrictions on the use of advanced military systems against Russian territory, Ukraine has gradually improved its position on the ground.\n\nThis can, and should, not detract from the fact that Russia has made gains in the land war and continues to do so while also targeting Ukraine's critical national infrastructure. But it does indicate that for as long as western support is forthcoming, it is unlikely that Putin's aggression will succeed.\n\nAll eyes on Washington\n\nBut, for all its heroism in the field, Ukraine is very far from establishing a clear pathway to victory. Russias' economy remains resilient, Moscow continues to mobilise more troops than Kyiv, and its alliances with Iran, North Korea, and China are giving it valuable economic, military and diplomatic cover.\n\nIt is not clear how long Russia can maintain this position of at least relative strength. But neither is it clear that Ukraine's situation will continue to improve.\n\nA return of Donald Trump to the White House after the US presidential elections in November 2024 - at present looking increasingly likely - would bring with it a resurgence of Trump's so-called \"America-first\" foreign policy. The US would then probably try to force Ukraine - and its other western partners - to accept Russian terms in a negotiated settlement.\n\nWithout any real, hard security guarantees for Ukraine in such a settlement, Kyiv would find itself back where it was a decade ago. Faced with Russian occupation of Crimea and large chunks of eastern Ukraine - and with lukewarm support from the west - it had to rely on a worthless \"agreement\" with Russia and no assurances against further Russian aggression.\n\nBut this isn't a foregone conclusion, whatever the outcomes of November's presidential election. On the contrary, the multiple security agreements that Ukraine has signed over the past few months also make an alternative future conceivable.\n\nIt's a future in which, with western help, Kyiv can demonstrate the futility of Russian aggression by regaining more territory and provide more effective air defences for its population and infrastructure. Western military aid, and the permission to strike at Russian military bases will help disrupt the supply lines that have enabled Russia's battlefield victories.\n\nIn this case, Putin is unlikely to look like the kind of winner that Trump likes to back. This calculation creates a window of opportunity for Ukraine's western partners over the next six or so months to double down on, and accelerate, their support for Kyiv and future-proof what ultimately might turn out a winning strategy in a war of attrition after all.",

        "title": "Ukraine war: Russia toughens up draft law to round-up more people for the frontlines",
        "body": "Aberystwyth University provides funding as a member of The Conversation UK.\n\nRussia is introducing laws aimed at closing loopholes used by those wanting to avoid the draft.\n\nEvading the draft has been relatively easy in Russia until now. All those who wanted to avoid military service needed to do was avoid receiving a paper draft notice.\n\nOne option was to move without letting the authorities know a current address, so that it couldn't be delivered. This new legislation closes that loophole as the draft notice will be considered served a week after it has been posted online on a government website.\n\nThe failure of the Russian government to share conscription data with border-crossing posts had also been an issue during the 2022 \"partial\" military mobilisation. This emergency mobilisation drafted 300,000 soldiers to be sent to Ukraine to counteract Russia's losses on the battlefield.\n\nBut Moscow was not able to stop young people who feared being drafted leaving in large numbers. Some sources reported 700,000 people leaving in September 2022 alone. But with the war in Ukraine continuing Moscow intends to stop this exodus from happening again.\n\nWhat changes?\n\nFrom November 1 2024, draft notices will also be collated along with other information that the government holds on its citizens, such as tax details, criminal charges or property, so officials can keep a complete profile of that person and what they do, and track their movements more closely.\n\nThe most notable change is, however, how draft notices will be served. They will no longer rely on a paper form being delivered to a physical address. From November these will be filed online and will be considered as delivered even if recipients do not have access to the internet or have not seen the notice.\n\nThis legal change is likely to affect the second conscription campaign of the year, known in Russia as the autumn draft (osennij prizyv). As the war in Ukraine shows no signs of ending, the huge numbers of people escaping the draft has presented a significant challenge for Moscow. Some estimates put Russia's losses at almost 900 soldiers a day, with the total quickly approaching half a million lives lost, according to UK government estimates.\n\nGiven this, Moscow is determined to increase conscription numbers, and stem the flow of those leaving over its borders to avoid being drafted. Those eligible for the draft are typically men between the ages 18 to 27, except for a few specific circumstances when women in certain professions (doctors, radio and map specialists) can be drafted. (Although the upper age for conscription could be raised to 30 at some point.)\n\nOnce the changes have been brought in, border forces will be able to access all of this online information, giving them the power to quickly check if people should be allowed to leave Russia. People who have had a draft notice issued online will be banned from crossing any border.\n\nA wave of departures?\n\nThese imminent changes have the potential to prompt a new charge to the border this summer, before the new law is implented in November.\n\nThe new system also has potential to allow the Russian government to track its citizens more carefully using this new database. This would make it harder for those attempting to evade the draft to maintain an online presence, have a bank account, or own a car, without the government catching up with them.\n\nAnyone who wants to leave, or dodge the draft, will have to come up with more elaborate ways of evasion than those they might have been used in the past.\n\nRussians might consider the Soviet-style draft evasion approach, when corruption within local authorities and medical institutions allowed people to buy fake disability certificates and other \"official\" documents that meant they could avoid being conscripted. Corruption in the Russian military is endemic, so new avenues like these may quickly open up.\n\nThese changes indicate that Moscow could be preparing for a prolonged conflict in Ukraine, despite recent discussions about resuming peace talks. Vladimir Putin has said that Russia is ready to stop the war if Ukraine agrees to the Kremlin's terms. However, the preparation for the 2024 autumn conscription campaign might indicate that this is not the primary plan, as Moscow continues to make, and adapt, its military planning.",

He is now a recruit of the Russian Freedom Legion with the call sign \"Goga\".\n\nThis was reported by the representative of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Andrii Yusov and \"Goga\" himself at a press conference, an OBOZ.UA correspondent reports. According to Yusov, the destruction of the Serpukhov was part of Operation \"Rybalka\", which has been ongoing since 2023.\n\nAs a result of this operation, a large amount of important information was obtained and the \"Serpukhov\" ship was put out of commission for at least six months.\n\nA sailor of the Russian Baltic Fleet, who had served in the Russian Federation for 11 years in 2022 questioned the adequacy of the Russian authorities when the aggressor country attacked Ukraine, and helped to carry out the operation.\n\nAt first, he tried to find like-minded people on his ship, but a case was opened against him and the sailor had to communicate with the Russian prosecutor's office.\n\nIn 2023, \"Goga\" turned to the \"I Want to Live\" project, which coordinated him with the Legion. That's how the man became a saboteur and collaborated with Ukrainian intelligence.\n\nHe supplied classified information to the intelligence community until April 2024. That month, the Russian command decided to involve the crews of the Baltic Fleet in the war in Ukraine.\n\nTo avoid the Goga's participation in the war on the side of the Russian Federation, it was decided to transfer it to the territory of Ukraine. Before doing so, he sabotaged and set fire to the \"Serpukhov\" ship on which he was serving.\n\nIn addition, \"Goga\" passed classified information about the Baltic Fleet and the Russian military-industrial complex to the DIU.\n\nIt is known that the man is an ethnic Ukrainian and comes from a military family.\n\nAs a reminder, the Freedom of Russia Legion is a Russian legion within the International Legion of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, formed in March 2022 to defend Ukraine from Russian aggression. It consists of former military personnel of the Russian Armed Forces and other Russians, as well as Belarusians who sided with Ukraine.\n\nAs reported by OBOZ.UA, the \"Serpukhov\" missile ship was on fire in the Kaliningrad region of the Russian Federation on April 7, 2024. The ship was stationed at the occupiers' Baltiysk naval base. The \"Serpukhov\" was seriously damaged and sent for repair.\n\nOBOZ.UA's sources reported that the incident with the Russian ship was a special operation of the DIU.\n\nIt should be noted that on the same day, the Russian \"Catherine the Great\", the world's only ice-class supply ship, was on fire in Vladivostok, Russia. Moscow reported one dead and three injured.",

        "title": "Supreme Court's Broad Immunity Ruling May Empower Trump's Comeback",
        "body": "WASHINGTON -- In her dissent from a Supreme Court opinion that afforded former President Donald Trump broad immunity, Justice Sonia Sotomayor pondered the potential doomsday consequences: A president could pocket a bribe for a pardon, stage a military coup to retain power, order the killing of a rival by the Navy SEAL Team Six -- and be protected from prosecution for all of it.\n\nThe scenarios may sound part of an apocalyptic future. But the plain reality of the 6-3 opinion is that it ensures presidents have a wide berth to carry out official acts without fear of being criminally charged and it could embolden Trump, who was impeached twice and faced four separate prosecutions over the last year and a half, as he eyes a return to the White House.\n\nThe outcome is significant because Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has been public about wanting to pursue the same boundary-obliterating conduct that defined his four years in office, spawned criminal and congressional investigations and raised thorny questions about the scope of presidential immunity that were resolved largely in his favor in Monday's landmark opinion.\n\nRelated Story: Trump Says He Can End the Russia-Ukraine War in One Day. Russia's UN ...\n\n\"Over the long term, I think it will broaden what presidents are willing to do because they will see that there's a gray zone that the Supreme Court laid out,\" said Princeton University professor Julian Zelizer, who studies political history. The effect of the opinion, he said, will be to \"broaden the scope of what's going to be permissible\" and give presidents sufficient cover for acts that may veer into criminality.\n\nThe opinion authored by Chief Justice John Roberts did not dismiss the case charging Trump with plotting to overturn the 2020 presidential race, as Trump had desired, and it left intact the long-established principle that there's no immunity for purely personal acts. However, it significantly narrowed the case by finding that presidents enjoy absolute immunity for their core constitutional duties and are entitled to the presumption of immunity for other official acts.\n\n\"This is a full-throated endorsement of the unitary executive theory\" in a dramatic way, said Cornell University law professor Michael Dorf, referring to the theory that the U.S. Constitution vests extraordinary power in the presidency.\n\nFrom a practical perspective, the court's opinion means that the trial judge, Tanya Chutkan, must now engage in further fact-finding analysis to determine how much of the conduct alleged in the indictment from special counsel Jack Smith can remain part of the case.\n\nRelated Story: Manhattan Prosecutors Agree to Delay Trump's Sentencing\n\nImportantly for Trump, the one area the conservative majority said was unquestionably off-limits for prosecutors was his command of the Justice Department. That includes his directives to department leadership after the 2020 election to conduct what prosecutors said were \"sham\" investigations into bogus claims of election fraud, as well as his attempts to use the department's authority to advance his fruitless efforts to remain in power.\n\nThough the opinion doesn't make new law about the interplay between the White House and the Justice Department, Roberts affirmed that a president has \"exclusive authority over the investigative and prosecutorial functions of the Justice Department and its officials\" and may also \"discuss potential investigations and prosecutions with his Attorney General and other Justice Department officials to carry out his constitutional duty to 'take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.'\"\n\n\"I do think that this is a norm-breaking opinion and I can imagine Trump using this as a basis for a complete destruction of DOJ independence,\" said Boston College law professor Kent Greenfield.\n\nThe position from the nation's highest court is welcome news for Trump, particularly as he and his allies have suggested wanting to use the power of the presidency -- including, presumably, the investigative authority of the Justice Department -- to pursue retribution against political enemies.\n\nAfter his May conviction in his New York hush money case, Trump suggested he might try to retaliate against Hillary Clinton, his 2016 opponent, if he returns to the White House.\n\n\"Wouldn't it be terrible to throw the president's wife and the former secretary of state, think of it, the former secretary of state, but the president's wife, into jail? Wouldn't that be a terrible thing? But they want to do it,\" Trump said in an interview on Newsmax. \"It's a terrible, terrible path that they're leading us to. And it's very possible that it's going to have to happen to them.\"\n\nMore recently, he reposted a meme that suggested that former congresswoman Liz Cheney, who as the No. 3 Republican in the House broke ranks with her party and voted to impeach Trump over the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol, had committed treason and should face a military tribunal.\n\nRelated Story: How to Get Voters the Facts They Need Without a Trump Jan. 6 Trial\n\nThe posts and comments raise concerns given how Trump's interactions with the FBI and Justice Department as president shattered longstanding norms and became central to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into whether he had obstructed an inquiry into potential Russia coordination with his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nTrump urged his FBI director, James Comey, to an investigation into a close ally and fired him weeks later, berated his hand-picked attorney general, Jeff Sessions, for having recused himself from the Russia investigation and also sought the termination of Mueller.\n\nIn his report, Mueller did not conclude whether Trump had illegally obstructed the investigation, in part, because of a Justice Department legal opinion that says sitting presidents cannot be indicted. But he did say that presidents were not \"categorically and permanently\" immunized for obstructing justice by using their presidential power.\n\nTo be sure, there are safeguards still in place that could prevent most presidents from testing the limits of criminal immunity.\n\nThe threat of impeachment by Congress remains -- Trump was impeached over a call with Ukraine's leader and Jan. 6, but acquitted by the Senate -- as do the practices, protocols and norms that govern Washington bureaucracy.\n\nRoberts, for one, sought in his majority opinion to downplay the impact, saying Sotomayor was striking \"a tone of chilling doom that is wholly disproportionate to what the Court actually does today.\"\n\nBut even if the scope of presidential power is not directly expanded by the opinion, there's no question that it could benefit any president determined to abuse those powers.\n\n\"Not every president will take advantage, but the lesson, I think, of Donald Trump is: one might,\" Zelizer said. \"Or the lesson of Richard Nixon is: one might. And the 'one mights' are the lessons that you're looking for.\"",

        "title": "Passenger Demand Up 10.7% in May",
        "body": "The International Air Transport Association (IATA) released data for May 2024 global passenger demand with the following highlights:\n\n\"Strong demand for travel continues with airlines posting a 10.7% year-on-year increase in travel for May. Airlines filled 83.4% of their seats, a record for the month. With May ticket sales for early peak- season travel up nearly 6%, the growth trend shows no signs of abating. Airlines are doing everything they can to ensure smooth journeys for all travelers over the peak northern summer period. But our expectations of air navigation service providers (ANSPs) are already being tested. With 5.2 million minutes of air traffic control delays racked up in Europe even before the peak season begins, it is clear that Europe's ANSPs have unresolved challenges. And the 32,000 flight delays over the Memorial Day weekend in May show that challenges persist in the US too. Airlines are accountable to their customers; ANSPs must be as well. ANSP performance matters to their airline customers and to millions of travelers. We all need them to do their job efficiently,\" said Willie Walsh, IATA's director general.\n\nRegional Breakdown - International Passenger Markets\n\nAll regions showed strong growth for international passenger markets in May 2024 compared to May 2023. The load factor increased in all regions except North America.\n\nAsia-Pacific airlines continue to lead the way, with a 27.0% year-on-year increase in demand. Capacity increased 26.0% year-on-year and the load factor rose to 81.6% (+0.6ppt compared to May 2023). This performance maintains Asian carriers as the largest contributor to\n\nindustry-wide growth in May, accounting for 42% of the year-on-year increase.\n\nEuropean carriers saw an 11.7% year-on-year increase in demand. Capacity increased 11.3% year-on-year, and the load factor was 84.7% (up 0.3ppt compared to May 2023).\n\nMiddle Eastern airlines saw a 9.7% year-on-year increase in demand. Capacity increased 9.0% year-on-year and the load factor increased 0.5ppt to 80.7% compared to May 2023. Asian routes to the Middle East are particularly strong, now standing some 32% higher than in 2019. Another notable development is the Europe-Middle East route, which saw an April-May RPK increase for two years in a row, reversing the previous historic pattern of a decline between these months. In the coming months, it will become clearer to what extent these trends could be related to the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nNorth American carriers saw an 8.1% year-on-year increase in demand. Capacity increased 9.7% year-on-year, and the load factor fell to 84.0% (-1.2ppt compared to May 2023).\n\nLatin American airlines saw a 15.9% year-on-year increase in demand. Capacity climbed 14.3% year-on-year. The load factor rose to 85.1% (+1.2ppt compared to May 2023), the highest among the regions.\n\nAfrican airlines saw a 14.1% year-on-year increase in demand. Capacity was up 8.2% year- on-year. The load factor rose to 72.3% (+3.7ppt compared to May 2023). This was the fastest increase in load factor among all regions, although Africa still has the lowest load factor overall.\n\nDomestic Markets\n\nDomestic demand increased at a stable pace in May. China's growth rate surged in line with the post- Labor Day holidays. Japan declined -1.8% possibly reflecting low business and consumer confidence.",

Airlines achieved a record seat occupancy of 83.4% for the month. Despite strong demand, air traffic control delays in Europe and the US pose challenges. Willie Walsh, IATA's director general, emphasized the need for efficient air navigation service providers (ANSPs).\n\nRegionally, Asia-Pacific led with a 27.0% increase in demand, contributing 42% to the overall growth. European carriers saw an 11.7% rise, while Middle Eastern airlines experienced a 9.7% increase, with strong Asian and European routes. North American carriers had an 8.1% increase, but their load factor fell. Latin American airlines saw a 15.9% rise, achieving the highest load factor at 85.1%. African airlines had a 14.1% increase, with the fastest load factor growth, though still the lowest overall.\n\nDomestic markets showed stable growth, with significant increases in China post-Labor Day, while Japan saw a decline of 1.8%, possibly due to low business and consumer confidence."

This rejection follows six elections over the past three years, all resulting in unstable coalitions. GERB, which finished first in the June elections, holds only 68 of the 240 seats in the National Assembly. The party's leader, Boyko Borissov, who led three previous governments, opted not to become prime minister again, but his efforts to form a coalition failed.

They agreed to share the Prime Ministerial position on a rotation basis for the rest of the term of the Parliament.\n\nMeanwhile, the largest party in the ruling coalition - CPN-UML - withdrew support to Prime Minister Prachanda-led government.\n\nAlso Read | Russia-Ukraine War: Russian Missiles and Drones Strike Dnipro in Daylight Attack, Killing at Least 5, Injuring 47.\n\n\"Our party has withdrawn support to the government,\" said Bishnu Rijal, deputy chief of UML's publicity committee.\n\nThe CPN-UML has eight ministers in the Prachanda Cabinet, including Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Raghubir Mahaseth. The CPN-UML joined the government on March 5, after Prime Minister Prachanda allied with the CPN-UML, ditching its year-long partnership with the Congress.\n\nAll the UML ministers have submitted their resignations to the Prime Minister, Rijal added.\n\nNepali Congress, the largest party in the 275-member House of Representatives, has 89 seats at present, while CPN-UML has 78 seats. Their combined strength of 167 is sufficient for a majority of 138 seats in the lower house. Prachanda's party has 32 seats.\n\nThe Nepali Congress Central Work Performance Committee (CWC) earlier in the day met at Deuba's residence at Budhanilkantha to discuss the current political situation and the party's future strategy.\n\n\"The meeting reviewed the latest political situation in the country and discussed the future course of action,\" said NC spokesperson Prakash Sharan Mahat.\n\nThe meeting also endorsed the agreement reached between Deuba and Oli to form a new coalition and share the post of Prime Minister on a rotation basis, he said. The meeting mainly discussed the agenda and modality of formation of the new coalition government.\n\nThe seven-point deal finalised between Deuba and Oli on Monday night includes the sharing of the remaining three-year term of Parliament between the two parties, the ministerial division, provincial leadership roles and a rotation for the prime ministerial position. Oli will assume the post of Prime Minister in the first phase and after one-and-a-half-year, the Nepali Congress will get the leadership of the government.\n\nSpeaking to journalists after the meeting, party spokesperson Dr Prakash Sharan Mahat said, \"The prime minister should pave the way after the largest parties -- Nepali Congress and UML -- said they would form a new government together. This is also included in the decision.\"\n\n\"Other parties, too, are supporting the new Nepali Congress-UML alliance. So, the Nepali Congress CWC has requested the prime minister to pave the way,\" he added.\n\nMahat said a new government will be formed through the constitutional process if the prime minister does not pave the way for the formation of a new government.\n\nMeanwhile, the spokesperson of Janata Samajwadi Party Nepal Manish Suman said that his party will support the new coalition but has not yet decided on joining the government.\n\nJSP Nepal has five members in the Parliament. Rastriya Prajatantra Party with 14 members in the House of Representatives and Lokatantrik Samajwadi Party with four seats have also indicated support for the new coalition.\n\nHowever, embattled Prime Minister Prachanda has refused to resign from the post and said he would rather face a vote of confidence in Parliament.\n\nAccording to the constitutional provision, the prime minister losing a majority support in the House will be required to prove a majority within 30 days. The prime minister must seek a vote of confidence once a ruling alliance withdraws support. This will be the fifth time Prachanda, 69, will seek a vote of confidence within a term of one and a half years.\n\nThe former guerilla leader has won three votes of confidence in Parliament.\n\nThe CPN-UML has already urged Prime Minister Prachanda to step down from the position so that a new government can be formed as per the constitutional provision. It also asked all the political parties to join the \"national government\" under the leadership of Oli to bolster political stability in the country.\n\nNepal has had 13 governments in the last 16 years, indicating the fragile nature of the Himalayan nation's political system.",

It focuses only on generative AI and excludes artificial intelligence more broadly, which includes technologies like facial recognition or computer vision.\n\nAlso Read | Russia-Ukraine War: Russian Missiles and Drones Strike Dnipro in Daylight Attack, Killing at Least 5, Injuring 47.\n\n\"WIPO hopes to give everyone a better understanding of where this fast-evolving technology is being developed, and where it is headed,\" WIPO Director-General Daren Tang told reporters.\n\nOver the decade starting in 2014, over 38,200 GenAI inventions came from China. That's six times more than from the United States, which had nearly 6,300. They were trailed by South Korea with 4,155, Japan with more than 3,400 and India with 1,350.\n\nGenAI helps users create text, images, music, computer code and other content through the use of tools including ChatGPT from OpenAI, Google Gemini and Ernie from China's Baidu. The technology has been employed by many industries including the life sciences, manufacturing, transportation, security and telecommunications.\n\nSome critics fear that GenAI could replace workers in some types of jobs or improperly take human-generated content without fair or adequate compensation to the people behind it.\n\nAs with other types of patent applications, WIPO officials acknowledge that the quantity of GenAI patents doesn't indicate quality. It's hard to tell so early in the technology which patents will have market value or be transformative for society.\n\n\"Let's see how the the data and how the developments unfold over time,\" Tang said.\n\nThe U.S. and China are often seen as rivals in the development of artificial intelligence, but by some measures U.S. tech companies are taking the lead in making the world's most cutting-edge AI systems.\n\nSixty-one notable machine-learning models emerged from U.S.-based institutions in 2023, outpacing the European Union's 21 and China's 15, according to the annual AI Index from Stanford University's Institute for Human-centered Artificial Intelligence. Of EU countries, France had the most, with eight.\n\nBy another measure, the U.S. also has the most so-called AI foundation models -- such as OpenAI's GPT-4, Anthropic's Claude 3, Gemini and Meta's Llama, which are huge, versatile and trained on massive datasets.\n\nThe U.S. also has led China in private AI investments and the number of newly formed AI startups, while China has led in industrial robotics.

But as Democrats make the case the stakes of the election are momentous -- challenging no less than the foundations of American democracy -- they're wrestling with how to approach the 81-year-old who's supposed to be leading the charge for their party.\n\nAlso Read | Pakistan: PTI Chief Imran Khan Seeks Permission From Rawalpindi Court To Meet His Sons, Qasim and Sulaiman, in Adiala Jail.\n\nHere's how Democrats are handling the debate aftermath:\n\nRaising alarm\n\nAlso Read | Russia-Ukraine War: Russian Missiles and Drones Strike Dnipro in Daylight Attack, Killing at Least 5, Injuring 47.\n\nRep.

He praised Biden but said he \"has the opportunity to encourage a new generation of leaders from whom a nominee can be chosen to unite our country through an open, democratic process.\"\n\n\"Recognizing that, unlike Trump, President Biden's first commitment has always been to our country, not himself, I am hopeful that he will make the painful and difficult decision to withdraw. I respectfully call on him to do so,\" said Doggett, who's 77.\n\nSome other congressional Democrats have moved in recent days to outspoken concern not just over Biden's performance during the 90-minute debate last week but also the level of transparency Biden's team has offered about his mental fitness. They've tiptoed toward embracing the idea Biden should withdraw.\n\n\"Everybody is asking one question within the Democratic Party ... which is how do we defeat Donald Trump and how are we going to defeat the threat of authoritarianism,\" Rep. Jamie Raskin, a prominent Democrat from Maryland, said on MSNBC late Tuesday.\n\nHe added that the question of whether Biden stays as the presidential candidate or Democrats select someone else \"is a moving target. It has to happen quickly.\"\n\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., told a local CBS-affiliated television station he was \"horrified\" by both Biden's performance and Trump's falsehoods during the debate.\n\n\"People want to make sure that this is a campaign that's ready to go and win,\" Whitehouse said. \"That the president and his team are being candid with us about his condition -- that this was a real anomaly.\"\n\nSome are concerned Biden's weaknesses could tamp down potential voters' enthusiasm, creating a ripple effect that hurts Democrats as they try to maintain a narrow Senate majority and take back control of the House. Down-ballot Democrats are already confident they can outperform Biden in swing races, but if large numbers of voters reject Biden, it could impact them.\n\nWhile several vulnerable Democrats have stopped short of calling for Biden to withdraw, they've also cast the situation in stark terms: If Biden continues, he'll lose.\n\n\"The truth, I think, is that Biden is going to lose to Trump,\" Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, a Washington Democrat, told an ABC-affiliated television station. \"I know that's difficult, but I think the damage has been done by that debate.\"\n\nBacking Biden\n\nWith Biden's family urging him to stay in the race, attention has turned to senior Democratic lawmakers who could potentially persuade the president to withdraw his nomination. So far, top Democratic leaders have mostly stood behind Biden in public statements.\n\n\"There have not been discussions among senior leadership about anything other than making sure we continue to articulate a compelling vision for the future to the American people related to the issues of importance around the economy,\" House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters Monday in Pittsburgh.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, posted on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, after the debate that it showed voters there was a choice between \"four more years of progress, or four more years of attacks on our fundamental rights and our democracy.\"\n\nBiden was speaking with congressional leaders this week, the White House said Tuesday. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said they respected the opinions and thoughts of concerned party members, adding, \"that's what makes this party different than the other side.\"\n\nMany of Biden's allies have chided the news media for being fixated on Biden's mental capacities, arguing that instead the focus should be put on Trump's record of refusing to accept the results of the 2020 election he lost to Biden and repeatedly lying.\n\nRep. Veronica Escobar, a Texas Democrat who's part of Biden's campaign committee, conceded the debate wasn't what she hoped for but added, \"I think there needs to be a real conversation about the things that Donald Trump said. It is beyond vile.\"\n\nRep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., who was among Biden's surrogates at the debate, dismissed concerns.\n\n\"We are 100% behind Joe Biden,\" he said Friday. \"Crystal clear, end of story. He's our nominee. So anything else outside of that is just political chatter.\"\n\nFeeling it out\n\nThe June 27 debate infused a new dynamic into an election contest that had been marked by few surprises. Voters were familiar with Biden and Trump and had previously decided between the two in 2020.\n\nStill, many House Democrats were caught in a state of uncertainty as they faced a barrage of questions on the morning after the debate. Some chalked it up as little more than a bad night for Biden, but others are watching closely to see how voters react and whether Biden can execute a quick political recovery.\n\nRep. James Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat who helped Biden win the Democratic nomination in 2020, urged his party last week to \"stay the course.\"\n\nBy Tuesday, Clyburn was still supporting Biden for president, but he also told MSNBC that \"Biden may decide otherwise.\" Clyburn added that he would support Vice President Kamala Harris if Biden withdrew.\n\nClyburn and others like former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., are recommending that Biden prove to the American people that he's ready for another four years in office by going out and taking tough interviews -- something he has rarely done in recent years. Biden will sit for an interview with ABC, his first since the debate, later in the week.\n\nBoth Clyburn and Pelosi told MSNBC at midday Tuesday that they had not spoken directly with Biden since the debate. But Pelosi still emphasized that the president is on \"top of his game, in terms of knowing the issues and what is at stake.\"\n\nShe called on both Biden and Trump, who's 78, to face tests for their health and mental acuity.\n\n\"I think it is a legitimate question to say is this an episode or is this a condition. So when people ask that question, it's legitimate -- of both candidates,\" said Pelosi, who's 84.\n\nMeanwhile, rank-and-file lawmakers are watching to see how voter polls register the impact and whether it spills into down-ballot races. For months, vulnerable House Democrats have been distancing themselves from some of Biden's policies. That phenomenon could become more pronounced after the debate.\n\nRep. Jared Golden, a moderate Democrat from Maine, was already looking for ways to convince potential Trump voters to support him.\n\n\"While I don't plan to vote for him, Donald Trump is going to win,\" Golden said in a Bangor Daily News op-ed. \"And I'm OK with that.\" (AP)",

        "summary": "**Summary:**\n\nFollowing President Joe Biden's poor debate performance on June 27, 2023, Democratic lawmakers are divided on whether to support his re-election bid or urge him to withdraw. Concerns about Biden's age and mental fitness have been amplified, with some Democrats like Rep. Lloyd Doggett openly calling for his withdrawal. Others, including Rep. Jamie Raskin and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, express worries about Biden's ability to defeat Donald Trump and the potential negative impact on down-ballot races. Despite these concerns, senior Democratic leaders like House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer continue to publicly support Biden. The debate has introduced uncertainty into the election, with some Democrats suggesting Biden needs to demonstrate his readiness for another term through more public engagements and interviews. The situation remains fluid as lawmakers and voters react to the unfolding events."
