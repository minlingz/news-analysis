As threats to peace and security become increasingly complex and attempts to destabilize our collective defence become more sophisticated, Canada and its NATO Allies are standing united - dedicated to defending democracy, security, and freedom.\n\nPrime Minister, Justin Trudeau, today announced he will travel to Washington, DC, United States of America, from July 8 to 11, 2024, to participate in this year's NATO Summit.\n\nThe NATO Alliance stands steadfast - protecting freedom and in defence of democracy. NATO was founded 75 years ago, and Canada has been part of nearly every operation in the Alliance. At this year's Summit, we will strengthen our work to uphold the global order that underpins our prosperity and sovereignty,\" Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada.\n\nThe Summit will be an opportunity for the prime minister to reaffirm Canada's commitment to Euro-Atlantic security and stability, particularly in the face of ongoing Russian aggression and destabilization. He will highlight Canada's contributions to NATO's collective defence efforts across Europe, including through Operation REASSURANCE , Canada's largest active overseas military deployment.\n\nAt the Summit, Prime Minister Trudeau will meet with NATO Allies and international partners to strengthen Euro-Atlantic security. Together, NATO leaders will explore ways to bolster collective deterrence and enhance defence capabilities and cooperation, while addressing other ongoing and emerging threats to the rules-based international order.\n\nWhile in Washington, the prime minister will meet with members of the United States Senate and House of Representatives to advance opportunities for Canadian businesses, workers, and communities across the country - as part of our Team Canada effort to promote and defend Canada's interests in and with the United States.\n\nPrime Minister Trudeau and NATO Allies will be joined by the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, for a NATO-Ukraine Council meeting focused on enhancing support for Ukraine and further responding to Russia's unjustifiable war of aggression.\n\nDuring this meeting, Prime Minister Trudeau will underline the importance of continued military, financial, and humanitarian support to Ukraine.

        "title": "NATO will strive to project unity at Washington summit, but cracks emerge",
        "body": "WASHINGTON -- The 32 members of the NATO military alliance will meet in Washington next week to project a united front on Ukraine and its fight against Russian aggression, but there could be some fractures behind the harmonious facade.\n\nBulgarian President Rumen Radev last week refused to lead his country's delegation to the NATO summit due to disagreements with Bulgaria's position in support of Ukraine.\n\nSlovakia's prime minister, Robert Fico, claimed last month that he was the target of an assassination attempt because his opposition to arming Ukraine deviated from the European mainstream.\n\nAnd Hungary has continued to maintain close ties with Russia and resist pressure to help Ukraine economically or militarily. Prime Minister Viktor Orban urged Ukraine on Tuesday to consider a cease-fire to speed up peace talks.\n\nMore cracks in the alliance could emerge Sunday with the potential electoral triumph of France's main far-right party. The party, National Rally, has a history of pro-Russia sympathies, and last year abstained in a vote on France's security pact with Ukraine.\n\nOutgoing NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg acknowledged the split in opinion on Ukraine in a news conference with Orban in June but expressed optimism in the alliance ultimately standing together in solidarity.\n\n\"We are 32 allies, and sometimes there are different opinions, but we have proven again and again that we are able to overcome them and find a common way forward,\" he said.\n\nOrban has assured NATO that Hungary will not oppose the expected announcement next week of a new mission in Germany to coordinate aid to Ukraine as well as a long-term financial pledge by the alliance to provide military support. But Orban also made clear that Hungary will not contribute personnel or funds for the efforts.\n\nFor now, any disagreements among NATO allies concerning Ukraine seem to be superficial cracks in the veneer of the alliance rather than at its foundations, according to Sean Monaghan, a U.K. visiting fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.\n\n\"Gaining consensus in the face of differing national positions on critical issues is normal business for NATO, and I would expect any cracks to be patched up by the time we get to Washington next week,\" he said.\n\nThe main aim of the summit will be to maintain and show unity, especially as the alliance marks a landmark 75th anniversary while war rages in Europe, and its largest member -- the United States -- moves into a highly consequential presidential election, Monaghan said.\n\nThe public is unlikely to see the kind of discord that accompanied last year's summit in Lithuania, when open debate about Ukraine's future with the alliance caused Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to lash out in frustration, he said.\n\n\"We won't see any last-minute debates in public this time. We'll see a unified position on Ukraine,\" Monaghan said.\n\nBehind the scenes, countries such as Hungary and Slovakia could cause problems, but the biggest sources of potential obstacles will be the U.S. and Germany, said Luke Coffey, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank.\n\n\"Hungary and Slovakia are very loud with their rhetoric, but behind closed doors, they tend to be more cooperative and pragmatic. If we wanted to do something with Ukraine inside NATO, and the only voice against it was Hungary's, there are ways to make Hungary come around,\" he said. \"But if Berlin or Washington is against something, they're too big. They're too big to try to influence or persuade.\"\n\nWashington and Berlin are \"dead set against\" extending an invitation for Ukraine to join NATO, he said. However, support for arming Ukraine to repel Russia's invasion remains strong in NATO and is unlikely to change in the near term.\n\n\"Is the political will still there to do this? So far, I think the answer is yes,\" Coffey said.\n\nThat resolve is expected to continue even as various countries head to the polls. Coffey noted widespread fears in 2022 that the election of far-right leader Giorgia Meloni as Italy's prime minister would spell disaster for Ukraine never came to pass.\n\n\"Now, Italy is one of the strongest advocates for arming Ukraine,\" he said.\n\nThe glue holding the NATO alliance together ultimately goes beyond each member nation's shifting politics, Monaghan said.\n\n\"NATO is an alliance of liberal democracies,\" he said. \"The democracies have elections, and the positions of allies change, but I don't think they change so fundamentally to turn cracks into massive fissures. NATO is an alliance that's built on a community of shared values. It always has been, and I think it will continue into the future.\"",

        "body": "The Department of Defense announced a $2.2 billion boost to Ukraine's air defenses on Wednesday, which includes missiles for the Patriot systems and National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS) already in Kyiv's possession.\n\nAccording to a release from the DOD, the additional interceptors will be purchased from U.S. manufacturers under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI). Both the Patriot and NASAMS systems have played a crucial role in Ukraine's ability to defend against Russian air attacks.\n\nThe Pentagon also announced a $150 million boost for Ukraine through the Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) package, which allows the DOD to draw directly from the U.S.'s stockpiles. The PDA package will include additional air defense interceptors, artillery and anti-tank weapons.\n\nAccording to the DOD's announcement, this is the 60th time that the Biden Administration has drawn from Washington's inventories for Ukraine since August 2021.\n\n\"Make no mistake, Ukraine is not alone, and the United States will never waver in our support,\" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said during a meeting with Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov at the Pentagon on Tuesday. \"Alongside some 50 allies and partners, we'll continue to provide critical capabilities that Ukraine needs to push back Russian aggression today and to deter Russian aggression tomorrow.\"\n\nUkraine is currently in possession of at least two Patriot missile defense systems -- one that was donated by the U.S., and another that was provided in partnership between Germany and the Netherlands. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that Kyiv needs at a \"minimum\" of \"seven more 'Patriots' or similar air defense systems\" in order to defend against Russia.\n\n\"[Russian President Vladimir] Putin must be brought down to earth, and our sky must become safe again...And it depends fully on your choice...[the] choice whether we are indeed allies,\" Zelensky during a speech to the NATO-Ukraine Council back in April, as reported by Reuters.\n\nThe U.S. first provided Ukraine with NASAMS systems in November 2022. Other NATO allies, including Norway and Lithuania, have also pledged to deliver defense launches to Ukraine.\n\nPurchasing additional interceptors through the USAI program takes longer than providing Ukraine with supplies under the PDA, although the Biden administration \"plans to accelerate delivery of [USAI] munitions by re-sequencing upcoming Foreign Military Sales deliveries for Ukraine,\" according to the Pentagon's release.\n\n\"As a result, Ukraine will be provided with the interceptors it urgently needs to protect its people and critical infrastructure against Russia's aerial attacks,\" the DOD added.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Ukraine's Ministry of Defense via email for additional comment.",

The state-run Việt Nam News said Vietnam had no criticism of Myanmar's decision 11 August 2009 to place Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest for the next 18 months, effectively barring her from elections scheduled for 2010. \"It is our view that the Aung San Suu Kyi trial is an internal affair of Myanmar\", Vietnamese government spokesman Le Dung stated on the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In contrast with other ASEAN member states, Dung said Vietnam has always supported Myanmar and hopes it will continue to implement the \"roadmap to democracy\" outlined by its government.\n\nNobel Peace Prize winners (Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the Dalai Lama, Shirin Ebadi, Adolfo Pérez Esquivel, Mairead Corrigan, Rigoberta Menchú, Prof. Elie Wiesel, US President Barack Obama, Betty Williams, Jody Williams and former US President Jimmy Carter) called for the rulers of Burma to release Aung San Suu Kyi to \"create the necessary conditions for a genuine dialogue with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and all concerned parties and ethnic groups to achieve an inclusive national reconciliation with the direct support of the United Nations\". Some of the money she received as part of the award helps fund London-based charity Prospect Burma, which provides higher education grants to Burmese students.\n\nThe US Government hoped that successful general elections would be an optimistic indicator of the Burmese government's sincerity towards eventual democracy. The Hatoyama government which spent 2.82 billion yen in 2008, has promised more Japanese foreign aid to encourage Burma to release Aung San Suu Kyi in time for the elections; and to continue moving towards democracy and the rule of law.\n\nIn a personal letter to Aung San Suu Kyi, UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown cautioned the Burmese government of the potential consequences of rigging elections as \"condemning Burma to more years of diplomatic isolation and economic stagnation\".\n\nSuu Kyi has met with many heads of state and opened a dialog with the Minister of Labor Aung Kyi (not to be confused with Aung San Suu Kyi). She was allowed to meet with senior members of her NLD party at the State House, however these meetings took place under close supervision.\n\nMay 30, 2015 ( Tony Cartalucci - NEO ) - As the plight of the Rohingya, driven from Myanmar into the sea, gains increasing international a...\n\n30 May 2015, Brian Berletic, May 30, 2015 (Tony Cartalucci - NEO) - As the plight of the Rohingya, driven from Myanmar into the sea, gains increasing international attention, the same familiar voices across the West have begun climbing upon their soapboxes and pointing fingers at each and every nation refusing to accept them upon their shores. What is not mentioned, conveniently, is who drove them into the sea to begin with.\n\nWho Are the Rohingya?\n\nThe Rohingya are a predominately Muslim people living in Myanmar's southwest state of Rakhine - and have lived there for generations. Many may be indigenous to Myanmar, having settled their centuries ago. Others may have come to Myanmar as a result of British rule during the 1800's.\n\nDespite the fact that they have lived in Myanmar for generations, they have suffered as a stateless people, with the political dynamics in Myanmar making it nearly impossible to grant them citizenship without considerable conflict and the threat of widespread violence.\n\nHowever, this is not because of the government of Myanmar will not grant them their citizenship.They have tried. It is the groups that have opposed Rohingya citizenship that has perpetuated this problem, groups the Western media has intentionally failed to expose and condemn.\n\nDemocracy Icon's \"Saffron\" Supporters\n\nThe group that is in fact driving the Rohingya from their homes in Myanmar and into the sea - and why this is not reported as the center of the current crisis - are the followers and supporters of the West's own \"patron saint of democracy,\" Aung San Suu Kyi.\n\nSuu Kyi herself, and many of the NGOs that support her and her political network are directly and substantially underwritten by the US and British governments.\n\nThese NGOs and faux-news agencies include the Irrawaddy, Era Journal, and the Democratic Voice of Burma (DVB), all admitted by the Burma Campaign UK (page 15) to be funded by the US National Endowment for Democracy (NED) along with \"Mizzima\" also fully funded by NED and convicted financial criminal George Soros' Open Society.\n\nThere is also the \"Burma Partnership\" which upon its \"About Us\" page is listed a myriad of associations and organizations directly linked to Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party, including the Students and Youth Congress of Burma, the Forum for Democracy in Burma, and the Nationalities Youth Forum, which is directly funded by the Euro-Burma Office (in turn funded by the EU, and US National Endowment for Democracy), and Open Society.\n\nThe heavily US-British-backed Nobel Peace Prize laureate's followers have prosecuted a campaign of ultra-racist genocide aimed at eradicating Myanmar entirely of the Rohingya people, often with orgies of machete-wielding brutality and neighborhood-wide arson leaving scores of people dead, and hundreds, sometimes thousands homeless, destitute, and above all, desperate.\n\nLeading the violence are Suu Kyi's \"saffron monks.\" The so-called \"Saffron Revolution\" of 2007 seeking to oust the Myanmar government and put into power Aung San Suu Kyi and her \"National League for Democracy\" was named so after the saffron-colored robes of these supporters.\n\nUnderneath the \"pro-democracy\" narrative, however, is an ugly truth that if known more widely amongst the global public, would spell the end of both Suu Kyi and her foreign backers' agenda in Myanmar.\n\nWhile the Western media attempts to shift the blame on the Myanmar government itself for the current Rohingya crisis, it was the government that attempted to grant the Rohingya citizenship through incremental programs that included allowing them to vote in upcoming elections. The plan was, however, disrupted by violence spearheaded by Suu Kyi's followers, as reported by Australia's ABC News article, \"Myanmar scraps temporary ID cards amid protests targeting ethnic minorities without citizenship.\"\n\nThe irony of Suu Kyi's supporters, supposedly representing a shining example of democracy worthy of a Nobel Peace Prize, attempting to deny hundreds of thousands of people their right to vote in elections is immeasurable.\n\nSuu Kyi, for her part, has remained utterly silent regarding the brutality and inhumanity of her most loyal and active supporters. While she is portrayed as a woman of courage and conviction, in reality these \"virtues\" were bought and paid for through millions of dollars of support for both her and her political network over the decades by the US and British governments. While her silence is shrugged off by the Western media as \"pragmatic\" and \"calculated,\" it is in reality merely her refusal to condemn the very supporters who have carved out a niche for her amid Myanmar's political landscape.\n\nThis carving has left a trail of blood and tears, one the Nobel Peace Prize has been shamefully used to distract the world's attention away from for years now.\n\nSuu Kyi's Followers Have Brutalized the Rohingya for Years\n\nAmong Suu Kyi's saffron butchers, there stands out one leader in particular, Wirathu. Wirathu has been involved in stirring up politically-motivated violence for over a decade. In particular, his group has carried out a bloody campaign against the Rohingya, even landing him in prison in 2003.\n\nThe International Business Times published an article titled, \"Burmese Bin Laden: Is Buddhist Monk Wirathu Behind Violence in Myanmar?\" explaining in further detail:\n\nThe shadow of controversial monk Wirathu, who has led numerous vocal campaigns against Muslims in Burma, looms large over the sectarian violence in Meikhtila.\n\nWirathu played an active role in stirring tensions in a Rangoon suburb in February, by spreading unfounded rumours that a local school was being developed into a mosque, according to the Democratic voice of Burma. An angry mob of about 300 Buddhists assaulted the school and other local businesses in Rangoon.\n\nThe monk, who describes himself as 'the Burmese Bin Laden' said that his militancy \"is vital to counter aggressive expansion by Muslims\".\n\nHe was arrested in 2003 for distributing anti-Muslim leaflets and has often stirred controversy over his Islamophobic activities, which include a call for the Rhohingya and \"kalar\", a pejorative term for Muslims of South Asian descent, to be expelled from Myanmar.\n\nHe has also been implicated in religious clashes in Mandalay, where a dozen people died, in several local reports.\n\nBy all accounts, Wirathu is a violent criminal leading mobs which have cost thousands of people their lives and has created a humanitarian crisis that is slowly engulfing all of Southeast Asia. Yet Wirathu is still counted among Suu Kyi's most vocal supporters and frequently weighs in on high level decisions made by Suu Kyi's political party. Furthermore, the West has failed to condemn him, place any sanctions upon him, and through their various media outlets, still grant him interviews, lending him continued credibility and influence.\n\nBeyond Wirathu, there are other \"monks\" who took to the streets in 2007's \"Saffron Revolution,\"a series of bloody anti-government protests in support of Aung San Suu Kyi. Human Rights Watch in a report titled \"Buddhism and activism in Burma\" (.pdf), would specifically enumerate support provided to Aung San Suu Kyi's movement by these organizations, including the Young Monks Union (Association), who are also now leading violence and calls for ethnic cleansing across Myanmar against the Rohingya people.\n\nThe UK Independent in their article, \"Burma's monks call for Muslim community to be shunned,\" mentions the Young Monks Association by name as involved in distributing flyers recently, demanding people not to associate with ethnic Rohingya, and attempting to block humanitarian aid from reaching Rohingya camps set up after being driven by their homes by violence.\n\nThe Independent also notes calls for ethnic cleansing made by leaders of the 88 Generation Students group (BBC profile here) - who also played a pivotal role in the pro-Suu Kyi 2007 protests. \"Ashin\" Htawara, another \"monk activist\" who considers Aung San Suu Kyi, his \"special leader\" and greeted her with flowers for her Oslo Noble Peace Prize address earlier this year, stated at an event in London that the Rohingya should be sent \"back to their native land.\"\n\nAre Myanmar's Neighbors to Blame?\n\nThis systematic genocidal brutality is what has driven the Rohingya to the seas from their rightful homes in Myanmar, scattering them abroad and creating a humanitarian crisis for other nations to bear. In particular, Myanmar's neighbor Thailand has been criticized vocally by the West as this crisis continues on, and more so now than ever since Thailand has ousted Washington and Wall Street's political order of choice there in a military coup in 2014.\n\nBut it is clear that the source of the problem is in Myanmar, and in particular the violence being used to drive the Rohingya from their homes. Myanmar's neighbors are but scapegoats for perpetrators not politically convenient for the Western media and the West's many so-called \"international\" institutions and rights organizations to name and shame. If anything, the perpetrators have created a political and humanitarian crisis regionally, giving the West an opportunity to meddle even further.\n\nRegardless of what Myanmar's neighbors do to assist Rohingya being driven from their homes, if the violence driving them abroad to begin with is not stopped, the humanitarian crisis will only continue to grow. Such violence, however, cannot be stopped so long as the self-proclaimed arbiters of international order and human rights not only refuse to condemn those guilty of precipitating this crisis, but in fact actively defend and support them.\n\nFor Southeast Asia, and in particular, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia - all nations targeted by the US and British with perpetual political meddling - exposing the true perpetrators of this crisis, and in particular the political order under which these perpetrators are operating, can expose Aung San Suu Kyi and her party and disrupt other foreign backed political proxies across the region like her. By doing so, perhaps an end can be brought to this current crisis today, and the next one prevented from unfolding tomorrow.\n\nThe Ronhingya are not \"stateless.\" They are not \"boat people.\" They are not \"without a home.\" Their home is Myanmar. Ultra-racist genocidal criminals, apparently with the support and blessing of the West, have driven them from that home.\n\nhttps://www.moonofalabama.org/2021/05/aiming-at-china-us-uk-launch-guerilla-war-on-myanmar.html\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20220116164718/https://www.moonofalabama.org/2021/05/aiming-at-china-us-uk-launch-guerilla-war-on-myanmar.html\n\nMay 06, 2021\n\nAiming At China U.S., UK Launch Ethnic Guerilla War On Myanmar\n\nIf you wonder what is happening in Myanmar there is no need to look further than these maps.\n\nChina needs oil but its sea main supply route through the Strait of Malacca is vulnerable.\n\nbigger\n\nPipelines through Pakistan and Myanmar provide for alternative routes.\n\nbigger\n\nThe pipe, road and rail lines through Myanmar are not only in China's best interest but also a great chance for Myanmar to further develop. They are in its [presumably meaning Myanmar's] national interest.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies are hostile to China. Threatening to cut its oil supplies is probably the most powerful tool in their box. Any alternative supply routes for China make this tool less powerful. The idea then is to prevent the possible use of these routes.\n\nSince its foundation after World War II Myanmar was ruled, sometimes more sometimes less brutal, by its anti-colonial military.\n\nThe first U.S. plan to gain control over Myanmar was to install a 'democratic government' that would do its bidding. In 2010, under pressure of U.S. instigated color revolutions, the military conceded to allow a civilian government but kept much of its constitutional and economic power. In 2016 the U.S. preferred candidate Suu Kyi, the daughter of the former military leader and Father of the Nation Aung San, was installed at the head of a new government.\n\nBut Aung San Suu Kyi turned out to be a nationalist and soon failed in the eyes of the U.S. regime changers. She was as friendly with China as the military and was equally aggressive against Myanmar's many ethnic minorities. Her eventual fall out with the military was not over those issues. The military owns key industries in Myanmar and Aung San Suu Kyi, and the 'civil society' people behind her, wanted a place at that trough.\n\nElections in 2020, which excluded voting in many ethnic regions, brought overwhelming support for Aung San Suu Kyi. This alarmed the military as it feared that its main source of income would soon be endangered. On February 1 it launched a coup and put Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest.\n\nThis brought a new chance for the U.S. to intervene. It immediately re-activated the 77 'civil society' organizations in Myanmar which it is financing through the CIA offshoot National Endowment for Democracy. Protest were launched together with attacks on Chinese companies and property.\n\nAs I described it at at that time:\n\nSo this is evidently a color revolution effort against the military.\n\nWhat is irritating with it is the speed with which it took off. Color revs usually require years of group building and leadership preparation. They need monetary and communication support as well as political directions from 'advisors' in 'western' embassies. Here it took only ten days to launch it.\n\nIn 2005 the Bush administration cultivated the Myanmar 'civil society' and Suu Kyi, who was then under house arrest. It popped up in the 'Saffron color revolution' in 2007 and with Cyclone Nargis in 2008 when the Bush administration tried to use Responsibility to Protect (R2P) nonsense to get a military foot on the ground.\n\nBut that all is a long time ago and after Suu Kyi had come to power there was no necessity to keep those efforts alive.\n\nThen again - under Myanmar's 2008 constitution the military was still effectively in charge. Together with Suu Kyi's large win in the latest election there may have been an long planned 'western' attempt underway to finally unseat the military from its privileged position and to pull the country out of China's orbit.\n\nBut the chance for that eventually to happen is practically zero. Some 70% of Myanmar's population lives in rural areas. The protests occur only in the three big cities Yangon, Mandalay and Naypyitaw and are relatively small. The military is ruthless and will have no trouble to take the protesters down.\n\nWhoever launched this nonsense should be held responsible for endangering those people.\n\nAs I predicted the protests, and the strikes the color revolution apparatus induced in form of a Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM), have since petered out:\n\nAlthough Thiha didn't want to abandon CDM, he also didn't want to lose his job amid a tanking economy. After weighing it up for a few days, he decided to get back to work.\n\n\"I have a loan from a microfinance company that I need to repay and a family to support - a wife and a five-year-old daughter,\" he said. \"It wouldn't be easy for me to get another job, particularly as I'd have to change my career.\"\n\nThere were just a handful of staff present when he turned up at his branch on April 20, but the number grew each day; by the April 29 deadline, about 80 percent had returned, although they were not yet wearing their KBZ uniforms.\n\nIt's a scene being repeated around the country, as tens of thousands of striking bank workers slowly get back to work.\n\nThis U.S. induced color revolution attempt against the military coup has failed.\n\nNow it is time for plan B - the Syria model: \"If we can't have it we will destroy it!\"\n\nA major Burmese ethnic rebel group has claimed to have shot down a helicopter belonging to the country's military. The incident comes amid continuing protests against the recent coup that ousted Myanmar's civilian government.\n\nThe Kachin Independence Army (KIA) said the helicopter had been shot down on Monday in Myanmar's northernmost province of Kachin. The aircraft is said to have been destroyed after Myanmar's military launched airstrikes against the rebels. ...\n\nFootage circulating online shows the helicopter - likely a Mi-17 transport-assault aircraft - sustaining an apparent hit from a portable anti-aircraft missile launcher.\n\nThe Kachin (red) in the north east and the Karen (orange) in the south east have a long history of fighting against the Burman (dark violet) majority and for autonomy within Myanmar. During World War II Burma's National Army under Aung San fought on the side of Japan to kick the colonial power Britain out of Burma. Britain, which at that time also controlled India, used the Kachin and Karen to wage a guerilla war against Japan's Burmese proxy forces.\n\nbigger\n\nUnder the great Quad project to fight China those old ties have now been reactivated. Former Indian ambassador M.K. Bhadrakumar explains the project:\n\n[T]he operative part hidden from view concentrated on the creation of a \"government-in-exile\" (a National Unity Government.) Alongside, Britain's MI6 sought to bring together Myanmar's main ethnic separatist guerrilla groups, encouraging them to take advantage of the chaos to open a second front.\n\nIndeed, some degree of proximity has since developed between the Burman protesters in Yangon and Mandalay on one side and the non-Burman minority ethnic groups on the other side. Despite a history of mutual antipathy, they have a convergence today to bleed the military. It is an improbable coalition of Buddhists and Christians, but as an American analyst cautiously assesses, it is doable: ...\n\nAt any rate, by mid-April, the first major armed attack on the military took place by the Karen National Union, Myanmar's oldest rebel group (which was originally created by the British colonial power as its proxy.) Such attacks have since become commonplace.\n\nToday, the so-called National Unity Government announced its intention to establish a Federal Union Army -- a military force of defectors from the security forces, rebel ethnic groups and volunteers. This would be a watershed transforming the anti-military agitation to an armed confrontation with the military. Myanmar is entering the crucial stage where Syria stood in 2011.\n\nThe Man Portable Air Defense (Manpad) missile used by the Kachin against a Myanmar army helicopter did not come out of nowhere.\n\nIt must have come from the MI6 or CIA through Myanmar's wide open borders with Quad member India. (Fielding provisions for the Karen near the Thai border are likely more complicate as the Thai military is itself under U.S. color revolution pressure and would not like to help with such efforts.)\n\nThere are more ethnic groups on both sides of the Indian border that can and will be used to wage a guerrilla war against Myanmar's military. With free supplies of modern weapons available to them they can create significant damage.\n\nMeanwhile the Juan Guaido like exile 'National Unity Government' will be used to pretend that there is real opposition to the military government. The 'Federal Union Army' will be a copy of the 'Syrian National Army' - a lose assembly of mercenaries and diverse warlord groups. 'White Helmets' like propaganda organization will likely also soon appear.\n\nThe hope is to ignite a wide ranging civil war that will make any Chinese projects in Myanmar impossible to implement.\n\nBhadrakumar finds that the project is well coordinated:\n\nThe US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with his Indian counterpart S. Jaishankar not less than three times in as many months since the military takeover in Myanmar. To be sure, India's cooperation is crucial for the success of the Anglo-American enterprise in Myanmar.\n\nMyanmar figured prominently at the G7 foreign ministers' meeting in London on May 3-5. Jaishankar travelled to London and met with Blinken. Neither side divulged details, but a Deutsche-Welle report flagged that \"China was at the top of the agenda as the G7 foreign ministers discussed a range of human rights issues. Addressing the Myanmar coup and Russian aggression was also on the docket.\"\n\nIt added that the G7 ministers watched a video from Myanmar's National Unity Government to \"update the ministers with the current situation on the ground.\" The joint communique issued after the London meeting devotes much attention to Myanmar (paras 21-24). It expresses \"solidarity\" with the National Unity Government and issues call for comprehensive sanctions against the Myanmar military, including an arms embargo.\n\nThe birth pangs of insurgencies are never open to public view, as intelligence agencies get the actors into play. The Myanmar situation has reached that point. This is the first big bash of post-Brexit UK (\"Global Britain\") on the world stage. As so often in modern history, London will lead from the rear.\n\nCountermoves to the U.S. and UK plans will come from Russia and China. A week before the coup Russia's Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu had visited Myanmar. On March 27 Russia's deputy defense minister Alexander Fomin was present at the annual Armed Forces Day parade in Naypyidaw.\n\nRussia has oil interests in Myanmar and sells weapons to its military. It is preventing any measures against Myanmar at the UN Security Council. In a sign that it knows what's at stake it has warned that sanctions against the military could lead to a full blown civil war.\n\nChina has so far stayed quiet on the issue. It will try to keep a low profile. Any open Chinese intervention is out of question but Chinese help may become important if or when Myanmar's government comes under financial stress.\n\nIt is sad to see that another little country, which wants nothing but to be left alone, will soon get destroyed in the 'western' attempt to keep China down. A proxy war between great powers no one but already rich people will benefit from.\n\nInvestigative historian Eric Zuesse's latest book, AMERICA'S EMPIRE OF EVIL: Hitler's Posthumous Victory, and Why the Social Sciences Need to Change, is about how America took over the world after World War II in order to enslave it to U.S.-and-allied billionaires. Their cartels extract the world's wealth by control of not only their 'news' media but the social 'sciences' -- duping the public.\n\nfrom https://theduran.com/how-the-u-s-empires-war-against-china-is-being-waged-in-myanmar-burma/",

        "summary": "The article discusses the geopolitical conflict in Myanmar, highlighting the involvement of the U.S. and its allies in a proxy war against China. Key points include:\n\n1. **Geopolitical Context**: The U.S. and UK are allegedly using Myanmar as a battleground to counter China's influence, particularly targeting China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects, which include vital pipelines through Myanmar.\n\n2. **Historical Background**: Myanmar has a history of military rule, with a brief period of civilian government led by Aung San Suu Kyi from 2016 to 2021. Suu Kyi, despite being a Nobel laureate, has been criticized for her handling of ethnic conflicts, particularly involving the Rohingya.\n\n3. **Ethnic Conflicts**: The article accuses Suu Kyi's supporters and Western-backed NGOs of perpetuating violence against the Rohingya, a Muslim minority in Myanmar, leading to a humanitarian crisis.\n\n4. **Recent Developments**: Following a military coup in February 2021, the U.S. allegedly reactivated civil society organizations to instigate protests and attacks on Chinese interests in Myanmar. The situation has escalated into armed conflict involving ethnic rebel groups like the Kachin and Karen.\n\n5. **International Involvement**: The U.S. and UK are accused of supporting a \"National Unity Government\" in exile and encouraging ethnic insurgencies to destabilize Myanmar. Russia and China are positioned as counterforces, with Russia providing military support to Myanmar's government.\n\n6. **Implications**: The conflict is seen as part of a broader strategy to limit China's regional influence, with significant humanitarian and geopolitical consequences for Southeast Asia.\n\nThe article suggests that the U.S. and its allies are using Myanmar as a proxy to weaken China's strategic position, leading to increased violence and instability in the region."

        "body": "The motorcycle's growling engine was no match for the silent drone as it stalked Babenko. \"Push, push more. Pedal to the metal, man,\" his colleagues called out over a walkie-talkie as the drone swooped toward him. \"You're screwed, screwed!\"\n\nIf the drone had been armed with explosives, and if his colleagues hadn't disengaged the autonomous tracking, Babenko would have been a goner.\n\nVyriy is just one of many Ukrainian companies working on a major leap forward in the weaponization of consumer technology, driven by the war with Russia. The pressure to outthink the enemy, along with huge flows of investment, donations and government contracts, has turned Ukraine into a Silicon Valley for autonomous drones and other weaponry.\n\nWhat the companies are creating is technology that makes human judgment about targeting and firing increasingly tangential. The widespread availability of off-the-shelf devices, easy-to-design software, powerful automation algorithms and specialized artificial intelligence microchips has pushed a deadly innovation race into uncharted territory, fueling a potential new era of killer robots.\n\nThe most advanced versions of the technology that allows drones and other machines to act autonomously have been made possible by deep learning, a form of AI that uses large amounts of data to identify patterns and make decisions. Deep learning has helped generate popular large language models, like OpenAI's GPT-4, but it also helps make models interpret and respond in real time to video and camera footage. That means software that once helped a drone follow a snowboarder down a mountain can now become a deadly tool.\n\nIn more than a dozen interviews with Ukrainian entrepreneurs, engineers and military units, a picture emerged of a near future when swarms of self-guided drones can coordinate attacks and machine guns with computer vision can automatically shoot down soldiers. More outlandish creations, like a hovering unmanned copter that wields machine guns, are also being developed.\n\nThe weapons are cruder than the slick stuff of science-fiction blockbusters, like \"The Terminator\" and its T-1000 liquid-metal assassin, but they are a step toward such a future. While these weapons aren't as advanced as expensive military-grade systems made by the United States, China and Russia, what makes the developments significant is their low cost -- just thousands of dollars or less -- and ready availability.\n\nExcept for the munitions, many of these weapons are built with code found online and components such as hobbyist computers, like Raspberry Pi, that can be bought from Best Buy and a hardware store. Some U.S. officials said they worried that the abilities could soon be used to carry out terrorist attacks.\n\nFor Ukraine, the technologies could provide an edge against Russia, which is also developing autonomous killer gadgets -- or simply help it keep pace. The systems raise the stakes in an international debate about the ethical and legal ramifications of AI on the battlefield. Human rights groups and United Nations officials want to limit the use of autonomous weapons for fear that they may trigger a new global arms race that could spiral out of control.\n\nIn Ukraine, such concerns are secondary to fighting off an invader.\n\n\"We need maximum automation,\" said Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine's minister of digital transformation, who has led the country's efforts to use tech startups to expand advanced fighting capabilities. \"These technologies are fundamental to our victory.\"\n\nAutonomous drones like Vyriy's have already been used in combat to hit Russian targets, according to Ukrainian officials and video verified by The New York Times. Fedorov said the government was working to fund drone companies to help them rapidly scale up production.\n\nMajor questions loom about what level of automation is acceptable. For now, the drones require a pilot to lock onto a target, keeping a \"human in the loop\" -- a phrase often invoked by policymakers and AI ethicists. Ukrainian soldiers have raised concerns about the potential for malfunctioning autonomous drones to hit their own forces. In the future, constraints on such weapons may not exist.\n\nUkraine has \"made the logic brutally clear of why autonomous weapons have advantages,\" said Stuart Russell, an AI scientist and professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who has warned about the dangers of weaponized AI. \"There will be weapons of mass destruction that are cheap, scalable and easily available in arms markets all over the world.\"\n\nIn a ramshackle workshop in an apartment building in eastern Ukraine, Dev, a 28-year-old soldier in the 92nd Assault Brigade, has helped push innovations that turned cheap drones into weapons. First, he strapped bombs to racing drones, then added larger batteries to help them fly farther and recently incorporated night vision so the machines can hunt in the dark.\n\nIn May, he was one of the first to use autonomous drones, including those from Vyriy. While some required improvements, Dev said, he believed that they would be the next big technological jump to hit the front lines.\n\nAutonomous drones are \"already in high demand,\" he said. The machines have been especially helpful against jamming that can break communications links between drone and pilot. With the drone flying itself, a pilot can simply lock onto a target and let the device do the rest.\n\nMakeshift factories and labs have sprung up across Ukraine to build remote-controlled machines of all sizes, from long-range aircraft and attack boats to cheap kamikaze drones -- abbreviated as FPVs, for first-person view, because they are guided by a pilot wearing virtual-reality-like goggles that give a view from the drone. Many are precursors to machines that will eventually act on their own.\n\nEfforts to automate FPV flights began last year, but were slowed by setbacks building flight control software, according to Fedorov, who said those problems had been resolved. The next step was to scale the technology with more government spending, he said, adding that about 10 companies were already making autonomous drones.\n\n\"We already have systems which can be mass-produced, and they're now extensively tested on the front lines, which means they're already actively used,\" Fedorov said.\n\nSome companies, like Vyriy, use basic computer vision algorithms, which analyze and interpret images and help a computer make decisions. Other companies are more sophisticated, using deep learning to build software that can identify and attack targets. Many of the companies said they pulled data and videos from flight simulators and front-line drone flights.\n\nOne Ukrainian drone maker, Saker, built an autonomous targeting system with AI processes originally designed for sorting and classifying fruit. During the winter, the company began sending its technology to the front lines, testing different systems with drone pilots. Demand soared.\n\nBy May, Saker was mass-producing single-circuit-board computers loaded with its software that could be easily attached to FPV drones so the machines could auto-lock onto a target, said the company's CEO, who asked to be referred to only by his first name, Viktor, for fear of retaliation by Russia.\n\nThe drone then crashes into its target \"and that's it,\" he said. \"It resists wind. It resists jamming. You just have to be precise with what you're going to hit.\"\n\nSaker now makes 1,000 of the circuit boards a month and plans to expand to 9,000 a month by the end of the summer. Several of Ukraine's military units have already hit Russian targets on the front lines with Saker's technology, according to the company and videos confirmed by the Times.\n\nIn one clip of Saker technology shared on social media, a drone flies over a field scarred by shelling. A box at the center of the pilot's viewfinder suddenly zooms in on a tank, indicating a lock. The drone attacks on its own, exploding into the side of the armor.\n\nSaker has gone further in recent weeks, successfully using a reconnaissance drone that identified targets with AI and then dispatched autonomous kamikaze drones for the kill, Viktor said. In one case, the system struck a target 25 miles away.\n\n\"Once we reach the point when we don't have enough people, the only solution is to substitute them with robots,\" said Rostyslav, a Saker co-founder who also asked to be referred to only by his first name.\n\nOn a hot afternoon last month in the eastern Ukrainian region known as the Donbas, Yurii Klontsak, a 23-year-old reservist, trained four soldiers to use the latest futuristic weapon: a gun turret with autonomous targeting that works with a PlayStation controller and a tablet.\n\nSpeaking over booms of nearby shelling, Klontsak explained how the gun, called Wolly after a resemblance to the Pixar robot WALL-E, can auto-lock on a target up to 1000 meters away and jump between preprogrammed positions to quickly cover a broad area. The company making the weapon, DevDroid, was also developing an auto-aim to track and hit moving targets.\n\n\"When I first saw the gun, I was fascinated,\" Klontsak said. \"I understood this was the only way, if not to win this war, then to at least hold our positions.\"\n\nThe gun is one of several that have emerged on the front lines using AI-trained software to automatically track and shoot targets. Not dissimilar to the object identification featured in surveillance cameras, software on a screen surrounds humans and other would-be targets with a digital box. All that's left for the shooter to do is remotely pull the trigger with a video game controller.\n\nFor now, the gunmakers say they do not allow the machine gun to fire without a human pressing a button. But they also said it would be easy to make one that could.\n\nMany of Ukraine's innovations are being developed to counter Russia's advancing weaponry. Ukrainian soldiers operating machine guns are a prime target for Russian drone attacks. With robot weapons, no human dies when a machine gun is hit. New algorithms, still under development, could eventually help the guns shoot Russian drones out of the sky.\n\nSuch technologies, and the ability to quickly build and test them on the front lines, have gained attention and investment from overseas. Last year, Eric Schmidt, a former Google CEO, and other investors set up a firm called D3 to invest in emerging battlefield technologies in Ukraine. Other defense companies, such as Helsing, are also teaming up with Ukrainian firms.\n\nUkrainian companies are moving more quickly than competitors overseas, said Eveline Buchatskiy, a managing partner at D3, adding that the firm asks the companies it invests in outside Ukraine to visit the country so they can speed up their development.\n\n\"There's just a different set of incentives here,\" she said.\n\nOften, battlefield demands pull together engineers and soldiers. Oleksandr Yabchanka, a commander in Da Vinci Wolves, a battalion known for its innovation in weaponry, recalled how the need to defend the \"road of life\" -- a route used to supply troops fighting Russians along the eastern front line in Bakhmut -- had spurred invention. Imagining a solution, he posted an open request on Facebook for a computerized, remote-controlled machine gun.\n\nIn several months, Yabchanka had a working prototype from a firm called Roboneers. The gun was almost instantly helpful for his unit.\n\n\"We could sit in the trench drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes and shoot at the Russians,\" he said.\n\nYabchanka's input later helped Roboneers develop a new sort of weapon. The company mounted the machine gun turret atop a rolling ground drone to help troops make assaults or quickly change positions. The application has led to a bigger need for AI-powered auto-aim, Roboneers CEO Anton Skrypnyk said.\n\nSimilar partnerships have pushed other advances. On a drone range in May, Swarmer, another local company, held a video call with a military unit to walk soldiers through updates to its software, which enables drones to carry out swarming attacks without a pilot.\n\nThe software from Swarmer, which was formed last year by a former Amazon engineer, Serhii Kupriienko, was built on an AI model that was trained with large amounts of data on front-line drone missions. It enables a single technician to operate up to seven drones on bombing and reconnaissance missions.\n\nRecently, Swarmer added abilities that can guide kamikaze attack drones up to 35 miles. The hope is that the software, which has been in tests since January, will cut down on the number of people required to operate the miniaturized air forces that dominate the front lines.\n\nDuring a demonstration, a Swarmer engineer at a computer watched a map as six autonomous drones buzzed overhead. One after the other, large bomber drones flew over a would-be target and dropped water bottles in place of bombs.\n\nSome drone pilots are afraid they will be replaced entirely by the technology, Kupriienko said.\n\n\"They say: 'Oh, it flies without us. They will take away our remote controls and put a weapon in our hand,'\" he said, referring to the belief that it's safer to fly a drone than occupy a trench on the front.\n\n\"But I say, no, you'll now be able to fly with five or 10 drones at the same time,\" he said. \"The software will help them fight better.\"\n\nIn 2017, Russell, the Berkeley AI researcher, released an online film, \"Slaughterbots,\" warning of the dangers of autonomous weapons. In the movie, roving packs of low-cost armed AI drones use facial recognition technology to hunt down and kill targets.\n\nWhat's happening in Ukraine moves us toward that dystopian future, Russell said. He is already haunted, he said, by Ukrainian videos of soldiers who are being pursued by weaponized drones piloted by humans. There's often a point when soldiers stop trying to escape or hide because they realize they cannot get away from the drone.\n\n\"There's nowhere for them to go, so they just wait around to die,\" Russell said.\n\nHe isn't alone in fearing that Ukraine is a turning point. In Vienna, members of a panel of U.N. experts also said they worried about the ramifications of the new techniques being developed in Ukraine.\n\nOfficials have spent more than a decade debating rules about the use of autonomous weapons, but few expect any international deal to set new regulations, especially as the United States, China, Israel, Russia and others race to develop even more advanced weapons. In one U.S. program announced in August, known as the Replicator initiative, the Pentagon said it planned to mass-produce thousands of autonomous drones.\n\n\"The geopolitics makes it impossible,\" said Alexander Kmentt, Austria's top negotiator on autonomous weapons at the U.N. \"These weapons will be used, and they'll be used in the military arsenal of pretty much everybody.\"\n\nNobody expects countries to accept an outright ban of such weapons, he said, \"but they should be regulated in a way that we don't end up with an absolutely nightmare scenario.\"\n\nGroups including the International Committee of the Red Cross have pushed for legally binding rules that prohibit certain types of autonomous weapons, restrict the use of others and require a level of human control over decisions to use force.\n\nFor many in Ukraine, the debate is academic. They are outgunned and outmanned.\n\n\"We need to win first,\" said Fedorov, the minister of digital transformation. \"To do that, we will do everything we can to introduce automation to its maximum to save the lives of our soldiers.\"\n\nWritten by: Paul Mozur and Adam Satariano",

Since October 2023, Qatar's continuous efforts in bringing the sides to the conflict together for talks and bridging gaps between the two parties cannot be understated, he added.\n\nThe ambassador also expressed his gratitude for Qatar's noble humanitarian efforts by stating, \"I cannot but mention that, thanks to our Qatari friends good offices, a number of Russian families separated by the conflict in Ukraine have been reunited, and were graciously hosted in Doha in April to partake in a programme of rehabilitation.\"\n\nMediation requires great patience and tactfulness to be successful. It is not for everyone, but Qatar has proved its capabilities in this regard. Thanks to its proactive foreign policy, it has soared very high both regionally and internationally, he highlighted.\n\n\"The Qatari leadership has set an ambitious goal for Qatar to become an indispensable, 'one-of-a-kind' mediator with a worldwide portfolio. I wholeheartedly believe that Qatar's capability and dedication match the ambitiousness of this noble goal,\" he said.\n\nChinese ambassador to Qatar Cao Xiaolin emphasised his country's great interest in developing relations with Qatar and its readiness to co-operate with the country in enhancing the role of the SCO, after officially becoming a dialogue partner of the SCO in 2022. This comes as China prepares to assume the rotating presidency of the SCO following the SCO Summit in Kazakhstan.\n\n\"Qatar holds significant influence in the Arab world and is an important member of numerous international organisations, actively contributing to regional stability and friendly cooperation among nations. In September 2022, Qatar officially became a Dialogue Partner of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), which is warmly welcomed by China,\" the ambassador said in an interview, adding that Qatar has actively engaged in SCO-related activities.\n\nChina looks forward to working with Qatar to enhance its role in the SCO based on mutual trust, mutual benefit, respect for diverse civilizations, pursuit of common development, and strive for international and regional peace and development, he added.\n\nIn regard to China's view of Qatar's success in mediating conflicts in numerous regions worldwide, \" Over the past three decades, Qatar has successfully mediated dozens of conflicts in the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and Europe, contributing to the de-escalation of tensions, effective settlement of conflicts, and facilitating family reunions for displaced individuals. These efforts have received high praises from the international community, and mediation diplomacy has become a shining hallmark of Qatar on the global stage,\" he said.\n\nDespite the ongoing war in Gaza, Qatar's relentless efforts to promote ceasefire agreements have been highly commended by the international community, the ambassador highlighted.\n\nIndian ambassador to Qatar Vipul highlighted Qatar's accession to the SCO, pointing out that hopes are rising that Qatar will contribute effectively to promoting the organisation's goals.\n\nSpeaking to Qatar News Agency (QNA), the ambassador said: \"India held the presidency of SCO for the first time last year and promoted the theme of SCO-SECURE which stands for Security, Economic development, Connectivity, Unity, Respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity and Environmental protection. We hope to continue our work on all these themes in SCO, including with Qatar.\"\n\n\"We believe that dialogue and diplomacy are the best way of enhancing international peace and security. Qatar's active regional and international diplomacy is well acknowledged across the world. We have always appreciated the deep insights shared by Qatar on the regional situation,\" he added.\n\nAmbassador of the Kyrgyz Republic Marat Nuraliev confirmed that Qatar has proven itself as a very honest mediator who seeks to resolve conflicts in the world fairly, which has led to strengthening its position in the region and the whole world.\n\nIn remarks to QNA, he said that Qatar's accession to the SCO allows it to participate in relevant events within the organization at the invitation of member states.\n\nHe added that within the framework of the organization, mutual trust, friendship, and cooperation can be strengthened with member states, as well as dialogue partner countries, including Qatar, to maintain and enhance peace, security, and stability in the region.\n\nTajik ambassador Nurmurod Mahmadali emphasised that Tajikistan is keen on supporting Qatar's initiatives within the framework of the SCO, noting the steadfast development in the bilateral relations across various fields supported by the leadership of the two friendly countries.\n\nIn his remarks to QNA, the ambassador said that Qatar has become an active member within the SCO, as Tajikistan has supported its accession process from the beginning. He added that Tajikistan is counting on Qatar to work with the member states of the organisation to carry out joint activities of a political, economic, and humanitarian nature.\n\nUzbekistan's ambassador Ashraf Khodjaev said that Qatar's accession to the SCO as a dialogue partner came as a result of its robust economy and visionary investment strategy which prioritises innovation and sustainability in sectors like renewable energy, infrastructure and digital technology.\n\nIn a statement to QNA, the ambassador said that the country fully supports Qatar's accession to the SCO, stressing that Qatar's open and balanced foreign policy promotes peace and stability globally, avoiding international or regional conflicts and disputes with neighbors.\n\nKhodjaev noted that Qatar shares the SCO's core principles of non-alignment, openness, equality and counter-based decision-making, adding that the country's involvement will help achieve the SCO's goals.\n\nHe said that Qatar, under the wise and visionary leadership of His Highness the Amir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani has established itself as a key player regionally and internationally, particularly through its successful mediations in global disputes. He pointed out that Qatar's diplomatic approach and strategic initiatives have earned a strong reputation for promoting peace and stability in conflict-ridden areas.",

        "title": "European Commission Competition Report Spotlights Potential Areas of Focus for Next Commissioner",
        "body": "Last week, the European Commission (EC) Directorate-General for Competition published a staff report on 'Protecting competition in a changing world: Evidence on the evolution of competition in the EU during the past 25 years'. We have read the report and believe that one can distill from it several principles that may guide competition policy in the next Commission:\n\nThe report appears to be the latest salvo in DG Competition's attempts to stave off dilution of its competition powers. The last significant part of this effort was passage of the Foreign Subsidies Regulation, which was borne in part out of a desire to avoid polluting competition policy with the political fallout which accompanied the Commission's block of the Alstom-Siemens merger (which was characterized as a merger of French and German \"champions\" to meet competition alleged to arise from government-subsidized Chinese manufacturers).\n\nThe report signals that the Commission's focus will be on the protection of competition and innovation competition (i.e., dynamic competition), particularly in sectors with existing high levels of concentration and clear signs of market power.\n\nThe report's conclusions in relation to lower income households and consumer-facing sectors suggest that these will be critical areas of focus for antitrust and merger enforcement going forward, with a potential goal of increasing the purchasing power of consumers to both reverse trends at the macro-economic level and improve competition. We expect that the EC may focus on these sectors in its enforcement strategy to send a message to other market participants.\n\nSpecifically for private equity deals, the report asserts that common ownership has been a structural driver for purported negative changes to competition, indicating a belief that common ownership (even at small minority levels) can influence competitive dynamics.\n\nWe do not expect any major changes in substance to the EC's approach in merger review. For antitrust enforcement, however, the report suggests a willingness to consider novel theories of harm whilst being open to discussion on effective remedies to protect innovation competition.\n\nBackground and summary of report\n\nThe Commission's report assesses the conditions of competition in the EU over the last 25 years and the main drivers of change, presenting new findings based on extensive economic research on the impacts on overall economic growth. The Commission draws on contributions from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a consortium of researchers led by economics consultancy Lear, and by the Chief Economist's team within DG Competition itself. It provides an update on the current factors affecting competition in the EU, the key drivers for this, and the impact of competition on economic outcomes.\n\nThe report, which was presented and discussed at a conference hosted by the EC on 27 June 2024, comes at a crucial political juncture for Europe. In particular, current European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will soon need confirmation from the European Parliament to renew her mandate. The vote is likely to be close. In exchange for supporting President von der Leyen, certain members of the European Parliament will likely seek concessions and there likely will be calls for a more interventionist industrial policy and more 'benign' enforcement of competition policy. These calls will likely be echoed in a report on European competitiveness expected to be issued by Mario Draghi (the former Italian Prime Minister and European Central Bank President) at the end of July. All of this will inform the selection of the next Competition Commissioner, the hearings in European Parliament of Commissioner-designates, and the EC's key policy priorities for the next five years. Indeed, there has already been mounting pressure to relax competition law enforcement in the next commissioner's mandate -- notably in the area of mergers, but also in relation to state aid. The report, however, may be one means by which current Commissioner Margrethe Vestager will try to resist this pressure.\n\nKey findings of the report\n\nOverall, the report finds weaker intensity of competition in the EU than in the past, with more pronounced market power and profit for firms at the top. However, the Commission caveats this with the finding that such weakened competition is still less pronounced than in other economies such as the United States.\n\nChanges to competitive intensity have been driven by both structural and institutional changes to how firms create value and compete in today's economy. The EC addresses how technological innovation, digitisation of business, public policies, and transformation in global supply chains (exemplified by China's re-integration into global trade) have changed the dynamics of trade and competition.\n\nThe second part of the report confirms and supplements prior findings that competition can have effects on prices and purchasing power of consumers, competitiveness of EU firms and overall economic growth. This is correlated to productivity, the most important factor for overall competitiveness and economic growth, with the research estimating that increased markups over the last 25 years might have reduced EU GDP by five to seven percent.\n\nThese key findings are discussed in more depth below.\n\nEvolution of competition\n\nThe report asserts that on average and in a wide range of sectors in the last 25 years:\n\nDrivers of evolution of indicators of competition\n\nAs changes to competition have been across many sectors of the economy, the EC suggests that the changes have occurred due to both structural and institutional drivers.\n\nStructural drivers. Structural drivers include rising investments in proprietary IT solutions and data, other intangible investments, globalisation, and changes to business conduct (i.e., M&A, oligopolistic pricing and behaviour, exclusionary strategies and common ownership by shareholders). In particular, the EC observes a link between access to intangible assets such as software and indicators of weakened competition.\n\n'Winner takes most' dynamics mean that large first-mover firms have been able to reap most of the benefits. The EC considers that this winner-takes-most framework initially enhances productivity growth. However in a second stage, it inhibits the process. That is, trends show that once a firm has established dominance through initial structural efficiencies, it then becomes easier to engage in exclusionary conduct, leading to high barriers for new entrants. During the EC's conference on the study on 27 June, Professor Nancy Rose at MIT Economics described this two-phase exclusionary behaviour as 'getting to the top and then pulling up the ladder behind you'.\n\nWhilst the rise in M&A and potential underenforcement are flagged by the EC, it doesn't attribute these to reduced competition.\n\nInstitutional drivers. Institutionally, the report observes regulatory barriers to entry and expansion contributing to these 'winner takes most' dynamics. In this respect, more vigorous competition enforcement in the EU as an institutional driver is attributed to less adverse effects than in the United States.\n\nRecent shocks to the EU economy are mentioned in the report, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia-Ukraine war, and rising inflation in the context of whether the EU competitive process is resilient and flexible enough to adapt to similar shocks in the future. However, no concrete conclusions are made.\n\nSpecific sectors of focus\n\nAcross 127 sectors, the report presents a scorecard of competition levels according to each sector's performance against the indicators of competition identified (i.e., concentration, mark-ups, profits, and measures of business dynamism). Having ranked each sector's degree of competition (according to the indicators), the report concludes that regulatory intervention has been most frequent in sectors with high competition risks based on the sectoral scorecard. Highest ranking on the scorecard include gas, telecoms, pharmaceuticals, rail transport, beverages, cement, and aerospace.\n\nAccording to the report, technological change and globalisation have had benign competitive effects on unconcentrated sectors or sectors where technological and business process innovations improve competition (for example, retail, car manufacturing and the manufacturing of semiconductors). At the other end of the spectrum, technological change and globalisation have, according to the report, led to a widening of the gap between leading firms and followers. Limited churn/dynamism at the top have been more detrimental to consumers in sectors such as consumer goods for household and personal care products, breakfast cereals, carbonated soft drinks, tobacco or beer, or in business-to-business sectors such as aircraft manufacturing, cement, and pesticides and seeds, according to the report. The report posits that sectors such as software and pharmaceuticals exhibit both benign and adverse consequences of such structural drivers, with technical progress simultaneously benefiting consumers but increasing barriers to entry.\n\nSeveral sector-based nuances bear mention:\n\nWhilst the EC has observed variances by sector, it has taken the view that intensity of competition in the EU is now weaker overall.\n\nImpacts on macro-economic trends\n\nThe Commission also considers effects on worrying macro-economic trends such as reductions in productivity growth, wage inequality, lower investments, and overall lower economic growth.\n\nMore effective competition resulting in lower markups, could have macroeconomic benefits in the reduction in price levels, increased household consumption and private investment, a strengthening of productivity and overall economic growth, according to the report.\n\nThe report estimates the weakening of competition since 2000 may have led to a five to seven percent drop in GDP, a four to five percent increase in prices and a one to three percent drop in productivity, with a potential worsened outcome by 25 percent were it not for EC interventions in the last 10 years. The report also estimates that implementing measures to limit market power of dominant firms may increase GDP by two to four percent.\n\nWhy competition matters for economic outcomes\n\nThe report posits links among competition, the competitiveness of companies and macro-economic trends, such that weakened competition harms productivity and long-term economic outcomes. The report also states that firms experiencing strong competition at a domestic level perform better globally, based on studies of successful export sectors. That is, domestic competition incentivises improvements to product quality, efficiency, and innovation.\n\nKey observations of the report's authors\n\nWe note the following key conclusions and messages in the Commission's report:\n\nSimilar findings, particularly in relation to increased concentration and its links to mark ups and profits, have been made in the United States, both by the Council of Economic Advisors in 2016 in their report 'Benefits of competition and indicators of market power' and the Chairperson of the Federal Trade Commission in 2018 in its contribution to the Quarterly Journal of Economics 'The rise of market power and the macroeconomic implications'. The 2016 report has since been cited by the Federal Trade Commission and the White House, including in the release of more stringent merger guidelines in July 2023.\n\nThe Competition and Markets Authority in the UK drew similar conclusions in its 2022 'state of UK competition' report, finding that the largest and most profitable firms are able to sustain their market position for longer than prior to the global financial crisis. This report notably conducted a more detailed analysis into common ownership and its effect on market concentration, and is similarly focused on end-consumer outcomes.",

He'd have a deal between the two warring nations wrapped up in a day, he said.\n\nTrump has also claimed that the billions of dollars in aid going to Ukraine was doing little good, adding that Kyiv is \"not winning the war.\"\n\nZelensky took umbrage with Trump's comments that Kyiv is losing, rejecting the term \"deadlock\" that Trump used to describe the conflict.\n\n\"It's not a deadlock, it's a problematic situation,\" Zelensky said. \"A deadlock means there's no way out.

The letter argues that Ukrainian NATO membership \"would reduce the security of the United States and NATO Allies, at considerable risk to all.\" The letter also calls into doubt whether Ukrainian NATO membership would deter a future conflict.\n\nThe letter argues that NATO expansion and the desire of many to incorporate Ukraine into NATO were the primary motivations for Russia's invasion. The letter claims that the sooner Ukrainian NATO membership is taken off the table, the sooner peace can be established.\n\nThe letter deprecates emotive arguments for Ukrainian NATO membership: \"The purpose of NATO is not to signal esteem for other countries; it is to defend NATO territory and strengthen the security of NATO members.\"\n\nThe letter included signatories from across the political spectrum, including the former Senator Jim Webb (D-VA), the international relations theorist John Measheimer, the foreign affairs expert John C. Hulsman, and William Ruger, president of the American Institute for Economic Research. Sumantra Maitra, a senior editor at The American Conservative, was also a signatory.",

We will not allow this,\" Scholz said.\n\nLast month, the Russian president named several conditions before peace talks with Ukraine could begin. Moscow would order a ceasefire the moment Kiev withdraws troops from the territory of all four regions that voted to join Russia and officially announces it no longer wishes to join NATO, he said.\n\nThe lifting of all Western sanctions and the \"demilitarization and denazification\" of the Ukrainian government would also have to happen before a peace could be concluded.\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban had proposed a \"quick ceasefire\" to Vladimir Zelensky on his visit to Kiev earlier this week, but said the Ukrainian leader \"didn't like it very much.\"\n\nScholz was also asked to guarantee that Germany would not become a party to the war. Berlin has been the biggest EU donor to the Ukrainian cause, while insisting that this did not make Germany a participant in the hostilities.\n\n\"Yes, I give this guarantee,\" Scholz said. \"As chancellor, I stand by that.\"\n\nGermany's ruling 'traffic light' coalition has been rattled by a poor showing in last month's European Parliament election, leading to speculation that Scholz might have to resign in the near future. The chancellor admitted that \"many people do not agree with the support for Ukraine and the sanctions against Russia,\" but refused to change his policy.",

        "body": "PETALING JAYA: Crude palm oil (CPO) is expected to regain its pricing competitiveness in the second half of 2024 (2H24) given tighter supplies and gradual return in demand resulting in higher prices.\n\nThis would be supported by lower production due to unfavourable weather conditions in 2H23 and 1Q24, along with recovering demand, as palm oil inventories in major importing countries like India and China had been trending downwards.\n\nUOB Kay Hian (UOBKH) Research, in its 2H24 outlook report, said it has maintained the CPO price forecast for 2024 at RM4,200 per tonne.\n\nYear-to-date, the CPO price averaging at RM4,029 per tonne is still within expectation, it added.\n\nAdditionally, short-term weather disruptions are affecting other crops, leading to lower production and shipment delays due to Red Sea tensions.\n\n\"This may continue to support CPO prices at the current level, trading in the range of RM3,800 to RM4,500 per tonne,\" added UOBKH Research.\n\nOther events to watch out for include the swing from El Nino to La Nina weather in the same year as well as record soybean harvests year after year.\n\nAlso, the macroeconomic uncertainties continue to persist, including the pace of China's economic recovery, potential slowdown in the United States, escalating tensions in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the impact on freight rates.\n\nMeanwhile, based on planters' latest 1Q24 earnings announcements, most of them reported a weaker quarter-on-quarter earnings growth mainly due to lower CPO production and sales volume, despite an improvement in CPO average selling prices (ASP).\n\nUOBKH Research noted operating margin improved significantly from 13.8% in December 23 to 17.2% in 1Q24, thanks to lower production costs and stable CPO ASP.\n\n\"We expect sector earnings growth to remain robust at 49% y-o-y in 2024.\n\n\"This projection is underpinned by the expected expansion of margins, driven by reduced production costs (especially fertiliser prices), yield recovery and our internal forecast of a higher CPO price of RM4,200 per tonne for 2024,\" it added.\n\nOn top of that, UOBKH Research has also observed higher pricing for byproducts such as palm kernel oil and palm stearin, which have improved by 23.5% and 9.4% year-to-date, respectively.\n\nIn the past two years, many plantation players have become net cash companies due to strong cash flow from high CPO prices and low capital expenditure, the brokerage firm pointed out.\n\n\"This financial strength has allowed them to raise dividend yields through higher payout ratios.\n\n\"Given their strong cash positions, plantation companies are expected to continue offering relatively high dividend yields, reflecting their financial stability and commitment to shareholder returns,\"the research house noted.\n\nUOBKH Research also said plantation companies have been providing strong dividend yields of 5% to 10% in recent years, supported by strong cash flows resulting from higher CPO prices.\n\nHence, the brokerage firm has maintained an overweight on the sector as \"we foresee the elevated CPO prices continuing to support earnings and good dividend payout.\"\n\nWhile the steady earnings growth may not be as attractive relative to the thematic theme now, UOBKH Research noted this sector could be a good investment for investors looking for steady capital appreciation as CPO prices may be supported by limited production growth going forward and good dividend yield.\n\nIts top picks within the sector are IOI Corp Bhd with a target price (TP) of RM4.80 and Hap Seng Plantations Holdings Bhd (TP: RM2.25).\n\nHap Seng Plantations will benefit the most as the group only sells in the spot market and enjoys better CPO ASP, accordijng to the research house.\n\nAs one of the most cost-efficient plantation companies, Hap Seng Plantation's earnings before income tax margin was 31% in 1Q24, compared with the peer average of 17%.\n\nIOI Corp, meanwhile, has the highest exposure to Malaysia, as well as higher refining margins compared with other big-cap plantation companies.\n\n\"Its valuation is also cheaper at about 15 times compared with other big-cap plantation players which are trading at 20 times to 25 times,\" UOBKH Research added.",

The occupiers struck the village of Ruska Lozova in the Kharkiv region with guided aerial bombs: two civilians were injured, one of them in serious condition.\n\nIn Poltava region, one person was killed in a Russian strike.\n\nNear Toretsk, the occupiers attacked an evacuation vehicle: two paramedics were injured.\n\nCiting two national security experts associated with US presidential candidate Donald Trump's entourage, Politico writes that the politician is considering talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin on \"NATO non-expansion\" and how much of the seized territory of Ukraine the Kremlin can keep.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that if Trump has a plan to end the Russian-Ukrainian war, he should share it. However, he warned that any proposal should not violate Ukraine's sovereignty.\n\nThe head of the Presidential Office, Andriy Yermak, also emphasized that Ukraine is not ready to give up its territories, but is ready to listen to advice on establishing a \"just peace\".\n\nOn the night of July 1, officers of the Defence Intelligence of Ukraine and the Foreign Intelligence Service attacked the Oskol Ugarov Electrometallurgical Plant in the Belgorod region. This is the only full-cycle metallurgical enterprise in Russia.\n\nAfter the attack, all electric arc furnaces at the plant stopped, as the metal froze.\n\nNATO members have agreed on annual funding of 40 billion euros for Ukraine, Reuters reports, citing an unnamed European diplomat.\n\nNATO leaders are expected to sign the pledge at a summit in Washington on July 9-11.\n\nUkraine has received a $2.2 billion tranche from the International Monetary Fund. The transferred amount should help the Ukrainian government finance critical budget expenditures, social benefits, and salaries for doctors and teachers.\n\nIn a veterinary clinic, a man cursed at doctor Oleksii Prytula, a veteran of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, when he apparently saw that he was wearing prostheses. The visitor wanted the vet to come to his dog.\n\nLater, a video of the man apologizing appeared online. He says he did not see that the vet was wearing prostheses. The doctor said he did not accept the apology.\n\nOn July 3, the Kyiv Court of Appeal left MP Mykola Tyshchenko under house arrest. The politician tried to appeal against the preventive measure imposed on him on June 25 after a conflict with a former military officer in Dnipro.\n\nThe lawyers said that there were not enough MPs in the parliament, to which the judge replied: \"There are also not enough judges, but we are working somehow.\"\n\nBloomberg, citing European officials, writes that Chinese and Russian companies are developing a drone analogous to Iran's Shahed attack drone. This indicates that Beijing is preparing to transfer lethal weapons to Moscow, as Western officials have previously warned, the journalists say.",

        "title": "Israel's war with Iran on seven fronts",
        "body": "Senior Writer, Foreign Policy & Deputy Editor, National Security and Foreign Policy\n\nWith Israel still engulfed in war in the Gaza Strip and openly considering a new offensive in southern Lebanon, concerns are mounting across the region over the prospect of an even larger conflict erupting that could see at least seven major fronts of fighting.\n\nAlready, Israel has faced strikes from multiple theaters since the Palestinian Hamas movement conducted an unprecedented surprise attack last October. Last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke of his nation being engaged in a \"seven-front war\" with Iran, saying it supports an informal coalition of regionwide factions known as the \"Axis of Resistance.\"\n\nThe following day, the Iranian Mission to the United Nations shared with Newsweek and published to X, formerly Twitter, a stark warning against any Israeli \"full-scale military aggression\" in Lebanon, home to the powerful Hezbollah movement that has been engaged with Israel in tit-for-tat cross-border attacks.\n\nSuch a move, the Iranian Mission warned, would lead to an \"obliterating war\" and, potentially, \"the involvement of all Resistance Fronts.\"\n\nIn response, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told Newsweek that \"the IDF is prepared for a variety of security scenarios in all areas, and will continue to protect the State of Israel from the various threats.\"\n\nNow, with threats only escalating and no imminent signs of ceasefire in Gaza or the Israel-Lebanon border, Newsweek has outlined the seven fronts in which Israel has already faced strikes and where further escalations could manifest in the event of a larger-scale conflict breaking out.\n\nThe Gaza Strip\n\nIsrael and Hamas have engaged in several conflicts and flare-ups since the Islamist Palestinian group took control of Gaza in 2007, two years after the IDF disengaged from a territory they occupied for decades and just one year after Hamas emerged victorious in Palestinian elections, sparking a violent rift with the traditionally dominant left-wing Fatah party. The deadly October 7, 2023, attack led by Hamas and the ensuing IDF offensive, however, has sparked the longest and deadliest war to date in the densely populated coastal territory.\n\nWhile Israeli officials have claimed major gains in the conflict, they have also acknowledged that achieving their stated goals of defeating Hamas as a functioning military and political entity, ensuring Gaza could not present a threat in the future and returning hostages still held in enemy territory could still take months. Hamas, meanwhile, has managed to continue to conduct near-daily operations, often in partnership with a diverse range of smaller factions.\n\nThe West Bank\n\nWhile the Fatah-led Palestinian National Authority (PA) retains nominal control over parts of the West Bank, President Mahmoud Abbas faces a major legitimacy crisis over popular resentment toward a lack of elections, accusations of corruption and growing Israeli military and settler activity that have eroded the PA's governing functions. The IDF has regularly conducted raids against suspected militia strongholds such as the Jenin refugee camp, while Hamas and other factions, including independent groups, have expanded their influence across the West Bank, including the disputed holy city of Jerusalem.\n\nWhile weapons smuggling into Gaza has long been an area of concern for Israel, the current war has drawn attention to the vast number of arms spread throughout the West Bank. Israel already exerts effective control over much of the territory, but a concerted offensive by groups here could further divert Israeli security resources otherwise needed to respond to other fronts.\n\nLebanon\n\nIsrael has already begun to double down on resources allocated to the northern front as a result of intensifying clashes with Hezbollah, which recently told Newsweek it was \"ready for anything.\" Israel has invaded Lebanon three times in the past and fought two major wars involving Hezbollah, but observers have warned that a new all-out conflict could be the most devastating yet for both sides.\n\nIsraeli officials have told Newsweek they estimate that Hezbollah has accumulated an arsenal of around 200,000 rockets, as well as mortars, drones, surface-to-air missiles, anti-tank missiles, precision-guided munitions, among other armaments. Widely considered to be larger and far more powerful than Hamas, a battle with Hezbollah could see major Israeli cities such as Tel Aviv and Haifa targeted with barrages of weaponry in a bid to overwhelm Israeli defense systems, such as the Iron Dome, in addition to Israeli troops facing constant fire on both sides of the border.\n\nSyria\n\nIsrael also shares a northern de facto border with Syria in the Golan Heights, much of which has been occupied and annexed by Israel without international recognition. Iran has expanded its influence across Syria since sending advisers and backing Hezbollah and a number of other militias in support of President Bashar al-Assad who has been embroiled in civil war against various rebel and jihadi groups since 2011, throughout which the IDF has conducted hundreds of airstrikes against suspected Iran-linked targets.\n\nSince the outbreak of the war in Gaza, Israeli officials have told Newsweek that a powerful coalition of such groups with close ties to Iran and Hezbollah known as the \"Imam Hossein Division\" have operated in both Syria and neighboring Lebanon. Launches against Israel have occurred occasionally, but an IDF airstrike that killed Iranian military officials at Tehran's consular building in Damascus sparked the first-ever direct exchange of attacks between Iran and Israel, exacerbating worries that the ongoing crisis in the Middle East could lead to an all-out battle between the two longtime rivals.\n\nIraq\n\nA number of the militias active in Syria hail from Iraq, which has emerged as a particularly active front since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war. While not directly bordering Israel, Iraq has been the source of frequent drone and missile attacks claimed by a coalition of factions known as the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, which includes prominent groups such as the Nujaba Movement, Kataib Hezbollah, Ashab al-Kahf and others.\n\nUntil February, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq also claimed frequent attacks on U.S. troops in Iraq and neighboring Syria, but the deaths of three U.S. soldiers at the Jordan-Syria border saw a comprehensive set of U.S. strikes against militia positions in Iraq and Syria and a pause to the campaign. These groups have warned, however, that their halt was tied to promises of a U.S. withdrawal from Iraq, something the Pentagon has signaled no plans to carry out, and Iraqi militia leaders have repeatedly threatened to not only resume but expand their campaign against U.S. forces as strikes against Israel continue.\n\nYemen\n\nLocated even further away from Israel, Yemen's Ansar Allah, or Houthi movement, has established itself as one of the most disruptive \"Axis of Resistance\" factions of the ongoing war. The group, which has held the capital Sanaa since 2015 in defiance of a Saudi-led coalition supporting the country's internationally recognized government, has launched missiles and drones against Israel, sometimes in joint operations with the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, as well as against commercial vessels across the region accused of violating the militia-imposed blockade of trade with Israel.\n\nAnsar Allah has also faced repeated strikes from the U.S. and the United Kingdom as a result of its maritime offensive. But the group has sought to fortify its military infrastructure with a system of underground complexes and has vowed to enter into direct war with both Israel and the U.S. if necessary.\n\nIran\n\nLike the U.S., Iran has repeatedly stated that it did not seek a regional war, and Iranian officials have told Newsweek that, even in the event of an Israeli war in Lebanon, they believed Hezbollah had sufficient strength to defeat their mutual foe. But the Islamic Republic's language has notably sharpened in recent months as the prospect of an Israel-Hezbollah war increasingly came into focus and Iranian officials have readily advertised their direct support for \"Axis of Resistance\" factions.\n\nIran possesses the largest and most advanced missile arsenal in the Middle East, only a fraction of which was put on display during the April barrage against Israel. While Israel has long displayed the ability to strike the Islamic Republic from within, an open war could test Israel, nearby Arab states and the U.S. like never before.\n\nOther Potential Fronts\n\nThe \"Axis of Resistance\" touts largely Shiite Muslim fighters from across the Middle East and beyond, to include units made up of primarily Afghan and Pakistani fighters. Both Taliban-led Afghanistan and neighboring Pakistan have issued warnings against Israel over its offensive in Gaza but neither nation has displayed any willingness to get directly involved in the conflict and both governments also have their own complex histories with Iran and its allies.\n\nStill, the Iran-aligned coalition has sought to further broaden its horizons to include contingents from other countries such as Jordan and Bahrain, both close U.S. partners that have sought to crackdown on domestic activity suspected to have ties to Iran. Azerbaijan, a close Israeli partner that also borders Iran, has also contended with pro-Iran elements at home.\n\nAlso complicating the regional landscape has been a growing partnership between Iran and Russia, which has utilized Iranian drones in its ongoing war in Ukraine. Russia has traditionally sought to balance its relationships with Iran and Israel but has emerged as an increasingly vocal critic of Israel's campaign in Gaza and its airstrikes in Syria, where Moscow maintains troops and air defense systems.",

        "title": "Georgia's double game: European integration and Chinese investments",
        "body": "Over the past year, Georgia has achieved candidate status for EU membership and signed a strategic partnership agreement with China. Experts fear that these two paths are incompatible.\n\nGeorgia-China relations\n\nGeorgia has decided to grant the Chinese consortium [CCCC] the right to construct the deep-water port of Anaklia on the Black Sea, a port of strategic importance to Georgia. Only this consortium participated in the government-announced tender.\n\n\"Currently, legal and commercial assessments are underway for the proposal submitted by the bidder, after which the winner will be announced,\" a representative from the Ministry of Economy told JAMnews.\n\nThe China-Singapore Holding Company [CCCC] has been sanctioned by the US due to questionable activities related to its operations in the South China Sea. Additionally, the company is on the blacklist of the World Bank, Asian, and African Development Banks for engaging in corrupt practices. While the Georgian government sees the deal with this company as an \"economic relief\" for the country, Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili described this choice as a \"stab\" to American and European partners.\n\nShortly before the deal with the Chinese, the Georgian Parliament passed a controversial \"foreign agents\" law, seen by strategic partners as a shift in the country's geopolitical course. Some experts suggest a linkage between handing over a key infrastructure asset to China and effectively abandoning the European integration process.\n\nRelations between Georgia and China have intensified, especially since Georgia obtained candidate status for EU membership. Following the signing of a strategic partnership document, China introduced visa-free travel for Georgian citizens, and Georgian prime minister Irakli Kobakhidze highlighted a multifaceted deepening of relations between the two countries, with pro-Chinese messages increasing on government channels.\n\nMoreover, Georgia received candidate status conditional on meeting 9 recommendations, including a new one to align its overall foreign and security policy with that of the European Union.\n\nExperts speculate that this recommendation was added precisely due to the intensification of Georgian-Chinese relations, as the EU views China as a threat and has \"doubts about Georgia's sincerity in Euro-integration.\"\n\nGeorgia-China relations\n\nIvane Chkhikvadze, a researcher at the Open Society Georgia Foundation, believes that the rapid rapprochement between China and Georgia is incompatible with European integration, and Georgia will have to choose between these two integration processes.\n\nAccording to Chkhikvadze, the above-mentioned EU recommendation is due to two reasons:\n\n\"First of all, it's the strategic cooperation agreement signed by Georgia with China, which, according to the EU's security concept, poses a threat to European integration. The second reason is that Georgia has resumed air traffic with Russia. These two factors have raised serious questions within the EU about how sincerely Georgia is interested in European integration.\"\n\nChkhikvadze believes that by implementing large infrastructure projects (in Greece, Albania, and now in Georgia), China is trying to create a unified belt that will somewhat compete with the European Union. The Georgian government, on the other hand, thinks that transferring key infrastructure projects to China will help Georgia fulfill its historical transit function and bring it even closer to the EU.\n\nBut, according to Chkhikvadze, when it comes to European integration, \"the main thing is to fulfill the 9 recommendations, and there is no need to look for other formats beyond this, no need to reinvent the wheel.\"\n\nAnother problematic aspect is China's lack of a clear position on the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\n\"This war has left no more gray areas in international relations. It's impossible for a country to remain neutral; it needs to either be against the aggression or side with Russia,\" says Ivane Chkhikvadze.\n\nHe believes that the Georgian government will not be able to maintain the fragile balance between European integration and rapprochement with China:\n\n\"Armenia is a good example of how balancing policies don't work. It tried to stay in Russia's orbit in terms of security while signing a partnership agreement with the European Union, and we all saw the result.\"\n\nExperts estimate that China's economic power has become its political tool. Rapid economic growth has made the country a major player in international trade and investment. Currently, China's economy is the second largest in the world (GDP $14 trillion), and the country is the largest global exporter of goods. Thanks to investments in infrastructure projects and strategic sectors, China's geopolitical influence is also growing.\n\n\"In general, Chinese policy is not rigid or aggressive, like Russia's, for example. On the contrary, it is quiet and covert,\" says sinologist Teona Gelashvili.\n\nTeona studied Chinese language and literature at Tbilisi State University, won a Chinese government scholarship, and went to China on a special study program. After completing the program, she decided to continue her studies at the Beijing International University in the Faculty of Sinology.\n\n\"These were international relations from an Asian perspective. Both Chinese and European professors taught. There I understood the peculiarities of how the Chinese view their country and the world from a political perspective.\"\n\nTeona believes that establishing strategic relations with China requires a detailed understanding of the country's politics and culture. Her interactions with Chinese people and companies convinced her of the importance of maintaining a principled position. According to Teona, it is very important what position the Georgian government takes now:\n\n\"It's important to understand that if one country is interested in another and invests a lot of resources, it wants to gain political influence over it.\n\nYou always need to be principled. If you show weakness, it will be exploited and used against you. It's necessary to have firm positions.\"\n\nGeorgia-China relations\n\nInternational relations expert Tornike Sharashenidze sees no risks at this stage in the intensification of economic relations between Georgia and China:\n\n\"Georgia is a poor country and it needs Chinese investments. If someone thinks we shouldn't have economic interests, that's just foolishness. Every country tries to have allies and partners everywhere. The more allies you have, the better it is for you.\"\n\nSharashenidze believes that, unlike the European Union, Georgia cannot afford to forgo Chinese investments. He welcomes China's investments in the Anaklia port if the state retains a controlling stake:\n\n\"Every small country has to consider the international context. When the world was unipolar in the 1990s and 2000s and America was the strongest state, Georgia fully aligned with the US. Now, with China as the second strongest player, Georgia takes this reality into account at some level. Moreover, Russia cannot openly oppose China. We can view cooperation with China as a counterbalance to Russia's influence in the region.\"\n\nAccording to recent data, China is Georgia's fourth-largest trading partner. Over the last decade, trade turnover between the two countries has tripled. The main sectors of cooperation between Georgia and China are transportation, energy, and tourism.\n\nSpecifically, the trade volume last year approached $2 billion, a significant increase compared to the $1.1 billion in 2019. In the first quarter of 2023, Georgia received almost $20 million in Chinese investments.\n\nGeorgia became the first country in the region to sign a free trade agreement with China.\n\nGeorgia established a visa-free regime for Chinese citizens in September 2023. On February 26, 2024, it was announced that the People's Republic of China would lift the visa regime for Georgian citizens. The visa-free regime took effect on April 10.\n\nThe agreement signed between the countries includes political, economic, international, and intercultural dimensions. Both sides agree that, alongside the intensification of trade, deepening bilateral relations is a priority in foreign relations. They announced the enhancement of political consultations between legislative and executive bodies and political parties. Georgia welcomes China's \"Belt and Road\" initiative, as well as initiatives for global development, civilization, and security, and is convinced that \"China offers humanity a new path and choice for achieving modernization.\"\n\nHowever, according to Georgia's foreign minister, \"the strategic partnership with China does not imply a change in the country's foreign policy course.\"",

        "summary": "Over the past year, Georgia has pursued both European integration and Chinese investments, raising concerns about the compatibility of these paths. Georgia granted the Chinese consortium CCCC the right to construct the strategic Anaklia deep-water port on the Black Sea, despite CCCC being sanctioned by the US and blacklisted by several international banks for corrupt practices. Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili criticized this move as a betrayal to Western allies.\n\nThe Georgian Parliament also passed a controversial \"foreign agents\" law, seen as a shift away from European integration. Experts suggest that Georgia's deepening ties with China, including a strategic partnership agreement and visa-free travel, conflict with its EU candidate status, which requires alignment with EU foreign and security policies.\n\nResearcher Ivane Chkhikvadze argues that Georgia must choose between European integration and closer ties with China, noting that the EU added a recommendation for Georgia to align its policies with the EU due to concerns over its relations with China and resumed air traffic with Russia. Chkhikvadze warns that balancing these relationships is unsustainable, citing Armenia's failed attempt to balance ties with Russia and the EU.\n\nChina's growing economic influence, through investments in infrastructure and strategic sectors, is seen as a political tool. Sinologist Teona Gelashvili emphasizes the need for Georgia to maintain a principled stance in its dealings with China to avoid exploitation.\n\nInternational relations expert Tornike Sharashenidze sees no immediate risks in Georgia's economic relations with China, arguing that the country needs Chinese investments and can use them to counterbalance Russian influence. China is Georgia's fourth-largest trading partner, with significant growth in trade and investments over the past decade. The two countries have signed a free trade agreement and established a visa-free regime, with plans to enhance political and economic cooperation.\n\nDespite these developments, Georgia's foreign minister insists that the strategic partnership with China does not signal a shift in the country's foreign policy."

        "title": "Starmer, Sunak make final UK election push",
        "body": "In a final push before Election Day, Labour chief Keir Starmer and Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak spent Wednesday issuing dire economic warnings about their opponent's potential victory, as they concluded their national campaign efforts.\n\nAccording to opinion polls, Starmer's Labour Party is poised for a landslide victory in the election on Thursday, potentially ending the Conservative government's 14-year reign and ushering the center-left leader into the prime minister's office at 10 Downing Street.\n\nLabour strategists, concerned about potential voter complacency or protest votes, issued a final appeal as polling stations prepared to open. In a statement, the party's campaign coordinator Pat McFadden sought to remind the electorate of recent economic turmoil.\n\n\"Don't forget the economic chaos for which the British people are still paying the price,\" he said.\n\n\"If you vote Conservative, nothing will change. If you don't vote at all or vote for another party, you run the risk of waking up on Friday to Rishi Sunak walking through the door to No 10 once again.\"\n\nStarmer has centered his campaign on a singular promise of \"change\", resonating with a public frustrated by the UK's current state of affairs, Reuters reported. His message addresses concerns over struggling public services and falling living standards, which are attributed to a sluggish economy and political instability.\n\nDuring his 20-month tenure as prime minister, Sunak has sought to convince the electorate that he has steered the economy onto a path of recovery.\n\nHe argues that his leadership has effectively navigated the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effect of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, while also bringing stability after years of turbulence under previous Conservative administrations.\n\nSunak claims that implementing Starmer's proposed reforms would necessitate tax increases.\n\nSpecter of tax hikes\n\nUnable to reduce Labour's substantial lead of approximately 20 points in opinion polls, the Conservatives have shifted their strategy from pursuing outright victory to damage control, aiming to reduce the margin of their potential loss.\n\nIn the closing stages of their campaign, the Conservatives have cautioned that a decisive Labour victory would embolden Starmer to implement tax hikes beyond those already disclosed.\n\n\"The larger the scale of the supermajority, the easier it will be to ram through extreme policies -- and the more tax rises will be inflicted on the British people,\"\n\nthe Conservatives said in a statement.\n\nOn Tuesday, former prime minister Boris Johnson made a surprise appearance at a rally event to bolster support for the Conservative Party and Sunak.\n\nJohnson argued that voting for Labour or backing right-wing party Reform on Thursday would \"achieve nothing but usher in the most left-wing government since (World War II)\".\n\nSky News reported an average of all polls completed in the week up to Tuesday puts Labour on 40 percent, ahead of the Conservatives' 21 percent, followed by Reform on 16 percent, the Liberal Democrats on 11 percent and the Greens on 6 percent.\n\nWriting in the Daily Telegraph newspaper on Wednesday, former home secretary Suella Braverman said victory should no longer be the ambition for the Conservatives.\n\nBraverman told Conservative supporters to prepare for losing the election.\n\n\"Thursday's vote is now all about forming a strong enough opposition. One needs to read the writing on the wall: it's over, and we need to prepare for the reality and frustration of opposition,\" she said.\n\nSpeaking to Times Radio, Cabinet minister Mel Stride said, \"Unless it's an extraordinary upset, which is highly unlikely, you're going to get a Labour government, you're going to get the change.\"",

I am grateful for his frank dialogue and his answers,\" Orban said.\n\nZelensky told reporters his priority was to see \"Europe's support for Ukraine maintained at sufficient level\" and that it was \"important for cooperation between all the neighbors in Europe to become more meaningful and mutually beneficial\".\n\nHe later wrote on X that Orban's visit was a \"clear signal to all of us of the importance of unity in Europe and taking collective steps\" and added that he and Orban had \"discussed the path to a just, lasting, and fair peace\".\n\nHowever, a government spokesperson of Ukraine later said the nation does not favor a cease-fire but would prefer to find a lasting peace through an international peace summit.\n\nIn his role as president of the European Council, Orban will have a lot of influence in the coming months. In the past, he has sometimes been out of step with other national leaders in the 27-nation bloc, especially around the issue of Ukraine, and he previously slowed the progress of a 50-billion-euro ($54-billion) EU aid package for Kyiv.\n\nDuring their meeting, Orban and Zelensky also discussed ways the nations could work together in the infrastructure and energy sectors, cross-border collaboration, and bilateral trade.\n\nThe BBC said they also spoke about Ukraine's large population of ethnic Hungarians.\n\nOrban, who was making his first visit to Ukraine for 12 years, also said the nations may sign a bilateral agreement to regulate ties.\n\n\"We would like to make the relationship between the two countries better,\" Orban said. \"We would like to make a broad bilateral agreement with Ukraine, similar to the ones we already made with our neighbors. We would be happy to take part in the modernization of Ukraine's economy, we would like an ordered framework for this.\"",

The news agency's account did not explain why the Kremlin was opposed to Erdogan's participation.\n\nThe Turkish presidency said the two leaders also discussed the war in Gaza and ways to end the conflict in Syria.\n\nTurkey is a member of NATO, the U.S.-led Western military alliance.\n\nUnlike other NATO leaders, who have imposed sanctions on Putin's government, Erdogan has tried to maintain good relations with both Russia and Ukraine throughout the conflict.\n\nTurkey played a key role in putting in place a deal to ensure grain could be shipped safely from Ukraine's Black Sea ports. The accord remained in effect for a year.\n\n(Reporting by Tuvan Gumrukcu and Huseyin Hayatsever; Editing by Peter Graff, Ron Popeski and Trevor Hunnicutt)",

        "title": "The idiot's guide to confiscating Russian assets",
        "body": "Know what moves the world. Stay informed with Kompreno. Get quality journalism from across Europe.\n\nRussia continues to destroy Ukraine, and the West and Ukraine are footing the bill. Meanwhile, the G7 countries have frozen $300 billion of Russian assets in their banks but cannot make the jump to seize them to help Ukraine's fight.\n\nWhy the holdup? Euromaidan Press explains in collaboration with the International Center for Ukrainian Victory.\n\nNot fully. First, we cannot fully calculate the extent of damage; second, human lives are priceless. After Ukraine's victory, much will remain to be done to bring Russia to justice. But right now, the G7 have frozen Russian assets in their countries, which can be fully used. However, even now, they are already less than the damages suffered by Ukraine, and the size of the damages is still growing.\n\nThe biggest slice of the pie is Russian state assets (reserves of the Russian Central Bank, Russia's central financial institution) - $300 billion. They've been frozen in banking institutions across the G7 countries.\n\nSo why are these assets parked there in the first place?\n\nWell, at the time of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia kept some assets in money and securities abroad in reliable banks, scooping up foreign currency.\n\nWe know for a fact that the lion's share of these assets, €192 billion to be precise, is held in Euroclear, a financial institution headquartered in Brussels that specializes in the safekeeping and settlement of securities.\n\nAs for the rest of the assets, their exact size and location are a bit of a mystery since that information is classified, but it's a safe bet that a hefty chunk is in the USA.\n\nThere are also Russian private assets floating around abroad, like yachts and businesses belonging to Russian oligarchs and propagandists.\n\nBut the total value of these is way smaller than the $300 billion in state assets, and confiscating them is a whole other can of worms. Each country has to make its own call on the matter, and then there's a court procedure to go through for each individual case, which is going to take a while.\n\nIt is also very difficult because the human rights of Russians owning them should be complied with, and the highest legal standards should be applied. That's why the spotlight is on the state assets, given Ukraine's urgent military and reconstruction needs. Confiscating these will be a quicker process.\n\nThis step falls under the category of countermeasures against an aggressor state that has launched an aggressive war and is violating international law left and right. Western countries have already frozen these funds based on this logic, but they haven't quite mustered up the resolve to fully confiscate them and hand them over to Ukraine.\n\nThere have been plenty of times throughout history when states have frozen the assets of other countries as a response to aggression:\n\nBut actually confiscating those assets and transferring them to the victim country? That's a lot rarer.\n\nHistorically, this has always been part of a post-war settlement, like the Treaty of Versailles after World War I or Germany's and Japan's World War II reparations. Directly confiscating frozen assets and handing them over to the victim country while the conflict is still ongoing? That's uncharted territory.\n\nIf the proposed use of frozen Russian assets for Ukraine's reconstruction actually happens, it would be a pretty big deal in this regard, but there are solid grounds for it.\n\nRussia stands accused of committing genocide in Ukraine and has caused mind-boggling damage to its infrastructure.\n\nThe reconstruction bill already stands at a whopping $486 billion, according to the World Bank. The damage to Ukraine's power grid is especially severe, with Russian strikes destroying 70% of its generating capacity.\n\nUkraine does not insist that this money is simply given to Ukraine; rather, the plan is to make the funds work for Ukraine's defense, which is the top priority. There are a few ways this could play out:\n\nUkraine is pushing for the ability to buy domestically-produced weapons with these funds, which are less expensive than western-made ones. They're also beefing up their capacity to handle the funds by ramping up anti-corruption measures.\n\nBeyond defense, the Russian funds are likely to be used for reconstruction and compensation for victims, although the exact breakdown isn't clear yet.\n\nOne big step forward to the confiscation of these funds was the US passing the REPO (Russian Elites, Proxies, and Oligarchs) Act on 23 April 2024.\n\nWhile successfully implementing it depends on further actions and certifications, the REPO Act lays out a legal mechanism for asset confiscation, gives the President the power to start the confiscation process, and allows for coordination with G7 countries, the EU, and other partners. It could potentially give Ukraine access to an estimated $5-8 billion in Russian sovereign assets located in the US.\n\nHowever, the G7 did not follow the US's lead.\n\nInstead, on 3 May 2024, the Financial Times reported that the G7 was no longer considering a full confiscation of frozen Russian assets, with an official saying that these assets could be used as leverage in potential peace negotiations with Russia.\n\nThis stance fails to recognize Russia's true objectives and the pointlessness of using these assets as a bargaining chip, given Russia's continued escalation of aggression and substantial revenues from fossil fuel exports.\n\nSeveral initial steps have been taken to ensure that Russia's frozen funds are already benefiting Ukraine:\n\nThis loan would allow Ukraine to survive. However, it would not ensure that Russia is punished for its crimes against mankind, ensure Ukraine's victory, or compensate Ukraine for the massive damages Russia caused.\n\nWhile Ukraine is set to receive portions of the frozen Russian assets, the entire $300 billion would be a game-changer. To put this sum into perspective:\n\nThis funding would allow the West to shift from \"drip-feeding\" weapons to a more impactful \"shock and awe\" support strategy. It would ensure a stable supply of ammunition and weapons, addressing the kind of shortages that led to Russian gains in spring 2024 when US aid was delayed.\n\nEconomist Timothy Ash argues that for Ukraine to pose a serious challenge to Russia, Western aid needs to increase from $100 billion to $150 billion annually. He suggests that using the confiscated assets is:\n\nIn essence, this massive injection of funds could provide Ukraine with critical resources while easing the financial burden on Western taxpayers.\n\nWhat could Ukraine do with $300 billion in Russian assets?\n\nTo put this sum into perspective, let's look at the numbers:\n\nInterestingly, with these resources, Ukraine has managed to destroy Russian equipment worth an estimated $98.7 billion - nearly double the value of their own arsenal (check out how we made these estimates here).\n\nIf Ukraine were to receive the full $300 billion, it could potentially increase its military capacity by almost six times. Of course, this is a simplification, as factors like equipment availability also play a role.\n\nSo, what could Ukraine actually buy with this money? According to defense expert Ivan Kyrychevskyi, here's a potential shopping list:\n\nKyrychevskyi estimates this funding could provide Ukraine with a 5-year security cushion. However, he cautions that even with money available, acquiring weapons isn't always straightforward due to availability issues and rising prices.\n\nRussia has already been forcing sales of Western assets at knock-off prices, as well as imposing punitive taxes on Western enterprises for a while now, way before any talk of confiscating Russian assets started:\n\nReports show that Russia had also basically stolen assets from a bunch of other Western companies by handing them over to state-owned enterprises or Putin's buddies' businesses for super cheap:\n\nRussia did all this in violation of international investment law, so Western companies have every right to hit back. Plus, the longer Western companies stay in Russia, the more likely it is that their assets will get snatched up or sold for peanuts.\n\nSo playing nice with Russia on this issue probably won't do much to protect Western investments anyway.\n\nRussia will definitely try to challenge the confiscation of its assets in court, because it can. It will likely file lawsuits in various courts like the EU Court of Justice, the European Court of Human Rights, the International Court of Justice, and international investment arbitration tribunals.\n\nBut here's the thing - Russia's chances of actually winning these cases are really low.\n\nAt the end of the day, if asset confiscation measures are well-designed and clearly based on Russia's well-documented violations of fundamental international laws and norms, they will have a strong legal foundation to withstand Russia's legal challenges. Careful legal framing can make the measures even more bulletproof.\n\nSo while Russia will certainly use whatever legal options it has to fight back, its own blatant disregard for international law leaves it without a strong legal case.\n\nThe only courts where Russia is likely to win are Russian ones, and then the decision will apply to the territory of Russia. So, theoretically, Western companies that are still doing business in Russia can be affected, but as we've already seen, Putin's regime can confiscate their assets without any legal pretexts anyway, so it would be wiser for them to simply get out of Russia.\n\nSome worry that confiscating Russian assets might hurt the EU's economy. They think the euro could lose value if people start pulling their money out of banks.\n\nThere's a fear that other countries might get spooked, thinking their money isn't safe in EU banks anymore. This could cause financial trouble in the Eurozone. Big players like China, Saudi Arabia, and Indonesia have been lobbying against asset confiscation, worried about what it might mean for their own money.\n\nBut these fears might be blown out of proportion.\n\nHere's the thing: Russian assets are only on the chopping block because Russia invaded Ukraine. If you're not planning to invade anyone, you've got nothing to worry about. And if you are, perhaps you'll get second thoughts. Two birds with one stone.\n\nSome are particularly worried about China pulling its investments from Euroclear. But so far, China hasn't made any threats or official statements about doing this. And they haven't done anything like this in the past either.\n\nEconomist Timothy Ash points out that when the West froze Russian money two years ago, emerging economies did not react in any way.\n\nHe also says that even if countries like Saudi Arabia and China wanted to move their money elsewhere, there's really nowhere else to go. Western banks are still the safest and most reliable places to keep large amounts of money. The euro is still a superstar currency, used in countries with detailed banking laws and high standards to protect people's money.\n\nAsh adds that if a country did try to move its money, it would probably end up hurting itself more than anyone else. They could face sanctions from Western countries, see less economic growth, have less trade and investment, and even see oil and commodity prices drop. Countries like Saudi Arabia and China care a lot about keeping their economies stable, so they're unlikely to risk all that just to back up Russia.\n\nSo, while some people are worried, it's pretty unlikely that taking Russian assets would cause other countries to pull their money out of Western banks en masse. The potential downsides for countries trying to move their money, plus the lack of good alternatives to Western banks, make this scenario highly improbable.\n\nAt its core, the issue of confiscation comes down to political will.\n\nDespite the various reasons that are raised in discussions about confiscating Russian assets, the true answer is that Western countries still aren't fully convinced of Ukraine's eventual victory. As a result, they lack a clear strategy for ensuring Ukraine's success and Russia's defeat.\n\nThey want to maintain a window for future negotiations with Russia. They fear that asset confiscation will be perceived as a serious escalation and are reluctant to demonstrate strength. They are concerned about jeopardizing future business opportunities, hoping that the familiar world in which Russia was a business partner will eventually return.\n\nThe US Congress passing the REPO Act shows that asset confiscation is legally doable and can happen if the political will is there.\n\nDespite this big step forward, the G7 countries still haven't gathered the courage to do the same.\n\nRecent reports suggest that the G7 is backing off from fully confiscating frozen Russian assets, with some officials hinting that these assets could be used as a bargaining chip in potential peace talks with Russia. This attitude doesn't recognize the true nature of Russian aggression and the Kremlin's ultimate goal of replacing the rules-based order with a \"might makes right\" approach.\n\nUltimately, the West's hesitation to confiscate Russian assets comes from not being fully convinced that Ukraine will win in the end and not having a clear plan for making sure Ukraine succeeds and Russia loses.\n\nSome Western countries are still hoping to keep the door open for future negotiations with Russia, worried that taking their assets will be seen as a major escalation. They're also worried about losing out on future business opportunities, holding onto the hope that the familiar world where Russia was a business buddy will eventually come back.\n\nBut Russia's actions over the past two years have made it clear that it has no plans to return to the rules-based international order.\n\nIt's time for bold moves, and the G7 needs to find the courage to follow the US's lead in confiscating Russian assets. By doing this, they can show they're committed to Ukraine's victory, hold Russia accountable for its crimes, and make it crystal clear that aggression won't be tolerated in the 21st century.\n\nEverybody's support matters, and you can help! Raise your voice and tell your politicians, and especially G7 leaders, that the confiscation of Russian assets is a step towards justice, because Russia must pay for the crimes it has done. You could publish appeals to G7 leaders, tagging them, in social media requesting the confiscation of the funds. You could also contact your local politicians and ask them to ask the G7 leaders to give a green light to the confiscation of the funds.",

Thank you American taxpayers,\" read sticker text on a photo of an invoice shared in a July 1 Instagram post.\n\nThe invoice shown in the Instagram post is to \"Mrs. Olena Zelenska\" for a preorder of a Bugatti Tourbillon with a total price of nearly $4.5 million.\n\nThe Tourbillon is a new car by the luxury automaker that will cost more than $4 million and won't be delivered to customers until 2026.

This time, she said, Bugatti is making \"an exception because it is a false report.\"\n\nBugatti Paris, the official Bugatti partner in France, said in a statement posted July 1 on Instagram that the invoice was bogus and contained multiple errors, including the car's price, according to Meta's translation of the post.\n\nThe statement was from the Car Lovers Group, which owns Autofficina Parigi, the company that operates the Bugatti Paris dealership. The Car Lovers Group issued the same statement in a press release posted July 1 on its website. It said the company has filed a criminal complaint.\n\nThe statement referred to a video from a supposed Bugatti employee that was included in the Verite Cachee article and also shared separately in other social media posts.

The Center for Countering Disinformation also suggested it was generated with artificial intelligence.\n\nThe Verite Cachee website was created June 22 and many of the site's headlines are incomplete, with words such as \"Here is a short title for the article,\" according to a Google translation.\n\nOne article on the website about the Russia-Ukraine war appears to leave instructions on how to write the article with a pro-Russian slant.\n\n\"Here are some things to keep in mind for context. Republicans, Trump, DeSantis, and Russia are good, while Democrats, Biden, the war in Ukraine, big business, and pharma are bad. Feel free to add additional information on the topic as needed,\" the article's first paragraph said.\n\nThe Center for Countering Disinformation said \"Russian propagandists launched this fake before the NATO summit in order to discredit Ukraine's top leadership in the international arena.\" The NATO summit begins July 9 in Washington, D.C.\n\nAn Olena Zelenska Foundation spokesperson referred us to the X thread posted by the Center for Countering Disinformation.\n\nThe claim that Ukraine's first lady bought a $4 million sports car while visiting Paris with her husband is False.",

But a problem can be solved if one has the will and has the tools. We do have the will, and the tools - they haven't arrived yet.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian president also praised the $61 billion assistance package passed by Congress earlier this year -- but said it was taking too long to get the equipment to the front, the outlet said.\n\n\"This is the biggest tragedy of this war, that between the decision and real fact, we have a real long, long, long wait,\" Zelenskiy said.\n\nYesterday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the Pentagon will send Ukraine a military aid package worth $2.3 billion that will include \"more air defense interceptors, anti-tank weapons and other critical munitions from US inventories,\" Austin said.\n\nSome of that money will also pay for additional Patriot surface-to-air missile systems and National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems that are critical to defending Ukraine's airspace from Russian attacks, he said.\n\nThe Ukrainian president also rejected overtures from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who urged him to consider a cease-fire.\n\n\"Nobody has an answer,\" Zelenskiy said, adding that those saying he should accept an armistice haven't said how it would work.",

We will not allow this,\" Scholz said.\n\nLast month, the Russian president named several conditions before peace talks with Ukraine could begin. Moscow would order a ceasefire the moment Kiev withdraws troops from the territory of all four regions that voted to join Russia and officially announces it no longer wishes to join NATO, he said.\n\nScholz was also asked to guarantee that Germany would not become a party to the war. Berlin has been the biggest EU donor to the Ukrainian cause, while insisting that this did not make Germany a participant in the hostilities.\n\n\"Yes, I give this guarantee,\" Scholz said. \"As chancellor, I stand by that.\"\n\nGermany's ruling 'traffic light' coalition has been rattled by a poor showing in last month's European Parliament election, leading to speculation that Scholz might have to resign in the near future.

        "title": "Xi Jinping-Putin-led club adds ally to confront US - ExBulletin",
        "body": "A club of Eurasian countries led by China and Russia to advance their leaders' vision of an alternative world order is set to expand again this week -- this time by adding a staunch Russian ally that has openly supported Moscow's war in Ukraine.\n\nBelarus' expected admission to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) at its annual leaders' summit in Astana, Kazakhstan, is a new attempt by Beijing and Moscow to transform the group from a regional security bloc into a geopolitical counterweight to Western institutions led by the United States and its allies.\n\nBelarus, which helped Russia launch its invasion of Ukraine in 2022, will become the latest authoritarian state to join the club, after Iran became a full member last year.\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in Astana for the summit that began on Wednesday (3), their second meeting this year. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, leader of the world's largest democracy, did not attend the event, underscoring unease among some members about the direction the SCO is taking.\n\nFounded in 2001 by China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to combat terrorism and promote border security, the SCO has grown in recent years in line with Beijing and Moscow's shared ambition to counter what they see as US hegemony and reshape the international system in its favor.\n\nIn 2017, the bloc underwent its first expansion to welcome India and Pakistan. With the addition of Belarus, it will have 10 members, representing more than 40% of the world's population and about a quarter of the global economy. The organization also has two observer states, Afghanistan and Mongolia, and more than a dozen dialogue partners ranging from Myanmar to Turkey and Arab states.\n\nThe SCO's expansion comes after another bloc led by China and Russia, the BRICS group of major emerging economies, more than doubled its membership and significantly expanded its global reach last year.\n\nAs the SCO has gained international visibility and economic clout, it has also expanded its geopolitical ambitions.\n\nThe expected admission of Belarus, a country bordering the European Union, highlights how the SCO's mission has changed in recent years, said Eva Seiwert, a China foreign policy expert at the Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS) in Berlin.\n\nUnlike Iran, Belarus' entry does not really result in much economic or security cooperation. That is why I argue that this is another geopolitical move.\n\nWith Russia deeply embroiled in the third year of its grueling war with Ukraine, the SCO has become a crucial diplomatic channel for Putin, as well as a platform to show that he is not isolated on the international stage.\n\nAs relations between China and the United States have collapsed, Beijing is now less concerned about the SCO being labeled an anti-Western organization -- a perception that has only deepened after Iran's admission, Seiwert said.\n\nThey want the SCO to be seen as a large bloc that can no longer be ignored, she said. With all these countries together, both China and Russia (who want to show it) have many supporters for their worldview.\n\nAnd in this common worldview, there is no place for the United States in Eurasia. At a meeting with senior Foreign Ministry officials last month, Putin outlined a future vision of a new system of bilateral and multilateral collective security guarantees in Eurasia, with the help of existing organizations like the SCO, and a long-term goal of gradually eliminating the military presence of external powers in the Eurasian region.\n\nDuring my recent visit to China, President Xi Jinping and I discussed this issue. It was noted that the Russian proposal is not contradictory, but rather comprehensive and is in line with the basic principles of China's global security initiative, Putin said, visiting Beijing in May.\n\nThis grand vision of an alternative future will be the main message to China and Russia at this SCO summit, said Bates Gill, a senior fellow at the National Bureau of Asian Research.\n\nBut Belarus' membership also creates big question marks that will weigh on the organization, Gill said.\n\nThis creates all sorts of problems and new questions about the reputation, legitimacy and mandate of the organization, given the nature of the Belarusian regime and its blatant support for Russia's violation of international law and invasion of Ukraine, he said.\n\nObviously, the SCO can tolerate authoritarian regimes, but for the organization's mandate, this further diversifies and dilutes its initial orientation, which was focused on Central Asia.\n\nThe bloc's expansion has not been without friction - notably the admission of bitter rivals India and Pakistan - while tensions between Beijing and New Delhi have also risen in recent years following deadly clashes on the disputed Himalayan border.\n\nThe group's increasingly anti-Western orientation following the admission of Iran and now Belarus has also fueled unease among members who want to maintain good relations with the West, including with former Soviet states in Central Asia.\n\nIn some ways, this puts the Central Asian states in a very uncomfortable position, Gill said. They are pursuing what they like to call multi-vector diplomacy. They don't want to commit to dealing with just one major power, like Russia or China.\n\nGill, who visited Central Asia in April and May, said there was ambivalence in regional capitals about the future of the SCO.\n\nIndia also seemed to be losing interest. Last year, the country hosted the summit virtually -- a low-key arrangement that allowed Modi to avoid the ethics of hosting Putin and Xi in New Delhi while seeking closer ties with the United States.\n\nThis year, newly sworn in for his third consecutive term, the Indian leader is absent from the Astana summit - despite reports in Russian state media that he will visit the Kremlin next week.\n\nThis tells us that the SCO is not the most effective channel to defend Indian interests in this part of the world, Gill said.\n\nEven China, the main force behind the SCO expansion, is seeking a more direct way to interact with Central Asia - without Russia's participation.\n\nLast year, five regional leaders were lavishly welcomed at the inaugural China-Central Asia summit in the Chinese city of Xi'an, the starting point of the ancient Silk Road trade route that linked imperial China with Western civilizations. recently. In March, a permanent secretariat for the China-Central Asia mechanism was established in the same city.\n\nAnd while China and Russia aspire to present the SCO as a counterweight to US-led institutions, it remains a much weaker and less cohesive bloc than NATO, the European Union or the Group of Seven.\n\nGiven the increased membership with India, Pakistan, Iran and Belarus, the organization will look even less like a common alliance or committed group, and more like a strategic vision-type organization...representing a Eurasian identity, Gill said.\n\nAfter the Astana summit, China is expected to take over the rotating chairmanship of the SCO for one year. Seiwert, the MERICS expert, said Beijing would try to find common ground among member states.\n\nFor China, it is important that the SCO does not fail, that it is seen as a success. I think they are also aware of all the difficulties associated with all these different expansions, she said.\n\nIf it continues to grow - if Russia and China continue to strive to expand - then I think its regional relevance will actually diminish.",

        "summary": "The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), a Eurasian bloc led by China and Russia, is set to admit Belarus, a staunch Russian ally, at its annual summit in Astana, Kazakhstan. This move aims to transform the SCO from a regional security group into a geopolitical counterweight to Western institutions led by the US. Belarus, which supported Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, joins the SCO following Iran's admission last year. The summit, attended by Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin, but not Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, underscores the bloc's growing anti-Western orientation. Founded in 2001, the SCO now includes 10 members, representing over 40% of the global population and about a quarter of the world economy. The expansion raises questions about the organization's legitimacy and mandate, especially given Belarus' controversial support for Russia. The SCO's increasing geopolitical ambitions and anti-Western stance create tensions among members, particularly Central Asian states and India, who seek balanced relations with the West. Despite these challenges, China, set to chair the SCO next year, aims to maintain the bloc's cohesion and success."

        "body": "The U.S. Department of the Treasury recently proposed new rules that seek to strengthen regulations against money laundering and terror financing and to ensure such security programs are effective in the current scenario.\n\nThe proposed rule targets anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) programs implemented at financial institutions like banks. It requires entities to adopt more stringent policies to counter such activities.\n\n\"The proposed rule is a critical part of our efforts to ensure that the AML/CFT regime is working to protect our financial system from longstanding threats like corruption, fraud, and international terrorism, as well as rapidly evolving and acute threats, such as domestic terrorism, and ransomware and other cybercrime,\" said Andrea Gacki, director of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) in a June 28 press release.\n\nThe new rules mandate institutions to amend their existing programs and explicitly require the establishment of effective anti-money laundering programs with certain minimum requirements including a mandatory risk assessment process.\n\nFinCEN further requires financial firms to work with and incorporate \"government-wide AML/CFT priorities,\" and promote clarity and consistency with new changes regarding laundering and terrorist financing activities.\n\nThe rule requires that AML/CFT programs have a designated individual or group of individuals tasked with coordinating and monitoring everyday compliance with related activities.\n\nInstitutions are required to have their anti-money laundering programs independently audited, in large part to assess whether these programs are adequate to combat illicit activities.\n\nThe report identified five key contributors to money laundering risks in the United States: misuse of legal entities; lack of AML/CFT coverage in sectors like investment advisory; the lack of transparency in real estate transactions; compliance and supervision weaknesses at regulated financial institutions; and merchants and professionals misusing their positions.\n\nThe Treasury Department found that the United States continued to face a \"wide range of terrorist financing threats.\" In addition to the terrorist organization Hamas exploiting the international financial system, the report also detailed violent extremist movements within America.\n\n\"Whether it's terrorism, drug trafficking, Russian aggression, or corruption, illicit finance is the common thread across our nation's biggest national security threats,\" said Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian E. Nelson.\n\n\"Treasury, through our National Risk Assessments, is at the cutting edge of analyzing the global risk environment to protect the U.S. and international financial systems from abuse by illicit actors.\"\n\nThe Treasury has recently taken several actions to crack down on money laundering operations that threaten the country.\n\nOn July 1, the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned money launderers based in Mexico and China who were linked to the Sinaloa Cartel, a major drug syndicate. The actions were taken as part of an effort to disrupt the inflow of narcotics into the United States.\n\nLast month, the OFAC sanctioned almost 50 individuals and entities that were part of a vast \"shadow banking\" network used by Iranian entities to gain illicit access to the global financial system.\n\nThe network was used, for example, by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL) to process billions of dollars in funds from 2020.\n\nSubsidiaries of MODAFL are known to manufacture ballistic missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles that are not only used by the Iranian military but also exported to terrorist groups like the Houthis based in Yemen.",

        "title": "Blinken attempts to bully China for its relations with Russia - BLiTZ",
        "body": "In a move likely to stoke geopolitical tensions, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken recently turned his attention to China, asserting that its support for Russia is exacerbating the most significant security threat in Europe since the Cold War. These comments come just a week before the NATO Summit in Washington, DC, and have been interpreted by experts as a strategic attempt to align European allies with Washington's geopolitical agenda, while simultaneously creating divisions and inciting chaos, potentially sparking \"another Ukraine crisis\" in Asia.\n\nBlinken's remarks, delivered at the Brookings Institution-a prominent Washington-based think tank-have added fuel to an already volatile international landscape. Blinken claimed that China's actions were contributing to Europe's greatest security threat and stressed that this sentiment is echoed by China's neighbors in Asia. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg echoed Blinken's rhetoric, accusing China of aiding Russia in inciting the largest military conflict in Europe since World War II by providing advanced technology for missile and drone production.\n\nChina was quick to rebuff these allegations. Mao Ning, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, responded to Blinken's comments at a press briefing, condemning the US for its attempts to provoke conflict. Mao questioned the values purportedly upheld by NATO, suggesting that if they involve creating conflicts and escalating tensions, China cannot endorse them. She argued that NATO has consistently interfered in China's domestic affairs, misrepresented its policies, and posed significant threats to China's interests and security.\n\nRegarding the Ukraine crisis, Mao reiterated China's commitment to promoting peaceful dialogue and finding a political solution. She urged NATO to reflect on its role in the crisis and focus on its contributions to peace in Europe and globally, rather than deflecting blame onto others.\n\nBlinken's statements are seen by many as a calculated move to drive a wedge between China and Europe, as well as between Russia and Europe. Li Haidong, a professor at China Foreign Affairs University, suggested that Blinken's rhetoric is designed to maintain US dominance and keep Europe in a subordinate position. By inciting division, the US aims to prompt its European allies to increase their investments in resources and capabilities directed toward engaging in a geopolitical competition with China. This strategy could potentially lead to the creation of a \"mini-NATO\" in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nMoreover, experts believe that the US is attempting to hinder China's development by complicating its internal and external environment, thereby ensuring America's continued global supremacy. This approach, however, is criticized as shortsighted and ultimately detrimental to US interests.\n\nThe rise of right-wing political forces in Europe adds another layer of complexity to this situation. Blinken's attempt to rally European allies against China might not be as effective as anticipated. There is a possibility of strong backlash and controversy, as European nations might resist being drawn into another geopolitical conflict orchestrated by Washington.\n\nBlinken emphasized the relevance of Asian challenges to European partners, citing a joint statement by NATO and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. The statement, made in the wake of the Ukraine crisis, suggested that events in Europe could easily be replicated in Asia, highlighting the interconnectedness of global security threats.\n\nWashington's approach, as noted by experts, seems to aim at inciting another crisis in Asia similar to the Ukraine conflict. For the US, global peace and stability do not align with its hegemonic aspirations. Instead, a turbulent world serves to maintain American dominance. This strategy, however, is transparent to many Asian and European countries, which recognize the US's intentions to incite chaos to secure its global standing.\n\nLi Haidong pointed out the potential for significant backlash against Blinken's statements. With the growing influence of right-wing nationalists in Europe, there is a strong likelihood that these remarks will not be well-received, and could instead foster greater resistance to US policies.\n\nBlinken's recent accusations against China reflect a broader strategy by the US to consolidate its influence and maintain its hegemonic position. By attempting to draw European allies into its geopolitical schemes and incite divisions, Washington risks provoking further instability. The reaction from China, as well as the potential backlash from European nations, underscores the complexity and volatility of the current international landscape. As the NATO Summit approaches, the implications of these developments will undoubtedly be a focal point of discussion among global leaders.",

        "title": "Biden's struggle and Trump's return: Age, Politics, and global consequences - BLiTZ",
        "body": "Joe Biden, the current President of the United States, recently faced one of his most challenging moments on the political stage. In a debate against his formidable opponent, Donald Trump, Biden's age seemed to catch up with him in a way that was unmistakable to tens of millions of viewers. The spectacle of this showdown highlighted not only the intense scrutiny politicians endure but also the merciless nature of public opinion and media.\n\nBiden's struggle during the debate was a stark reminder of how age can betray even the most seasoned leaders at critical junctures. In this highly anticipated and widely watched event, Biden failed to perform convincingly both as an attacker and a defender. He appeared unable to maintain the composure and sharpness that are crucial in such high-stakes encounters. This public faltering transformed what might have been seen as a minor setback into a perceived catastrophe.\n\nThe modern political landscape is unforgiving, especially under the relentless spotlight of social media, where commentators and critics can be particularly harsh. The slightest sign of weakness is often amplified, with slanderous and wolfish attacks that can sway public opinion dramatically. This environment is particularly unforgiving for a president seeking re-election, as any perceived decline in capability can have dire consequences for their campaign.\n\nWithin the Democratic Party, there is growing concern about Biden's ability to lead the charge into the next election. Prominent voices, including The New York Times, have suggested that Biden should consider stepping aside. This sentiment has been echoed by various party members who fear that his continued presence might lead to an unavoidable defeat. However, replacing a sitting president in the middle of a campaign is not a simple task. It involves complex political maneuvers and would require Biden's own agreement to step down -- a challenging prospect for any politician.\n\nJill Biden, the president's wife, has been seen by some as a potential influencer who might persuade her husband to make this tough decision for the greater good of the party and the country. Similarly, former President Barack Obama is also expected to play a crucial role in guiding Biden through this difficult period.\n\nConvincing a lifelong politician to retire is no easy feat. The allure of power and the prestige of office are hard to relinquish, especially for someone who has spent decades in public service, culminating in the presidency. The psychological attachment to power is profound, making the prospect of stepping down akin to accepting defeat. This was exemplified in an anecdote where a wise politician, despite his advanced age, could not easily detach himself from the presidential palace-a symbol of his enduring connection to power.\n\nThe recent debate not only highlighted Biden's personal challenges but also underscored the broader issues facing America. In an era of rapid technological advancements and geopolitical shifts, the country appears to be struggling to put forth a younger, dynamic candidate for the highest office. This has led to deeper divisions within the nation and increased uncertainty on the global stage.\n\nThe potential re-election of Trump adds another layer of complexity to this scenario. Known for his unpredictable policies and unorthodox approach, Trump represents a significant departure from traditional political norms. His return to the White House would likely exacerbate existing tensions both domestically and internationally. Allies and adversaries alike are wary of his volatile leadership style, which contrasts sharply with Biden's institutional approach.\n\nThe stakes in the upcoming election are incredibly high, not just for the United States but for the world at large. Trump's potential victory raises questions about America's role in global affairs, particularly concerning relations with Russia and China. Trump's perceived lack of seriousness about the \"Russian threat\" and his focus on China as the primary adversary suggest a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy priorities.\n\nIn Europe, there is widespread concern about the implications of a Trump presidency. Leaders worry that Trump's deal-making mentality might lead to compromises that could undermine European security, particularly in the face of Russian aggression. The fear of a repeat of the appeasement policies of the past looms large, with many drawing parallels to the pre-World War II era.\n\nIn the Middle East, the situation remains volatile with ongoing conflicts in Gaza and the potential for a wider war involving Lebanon. The prospect of a Trump-led administration complicates efforts to achieve a lasting peace, particularly given his controversial decision to assassinate Iranian General Qassem Soleimani. Negotiating with Iran under a Trump presidency would likely be fraught with difficulties, casting a shadow over any potential nuclear agreement.\n\nAs the 2024 election approaches, the political landscape is fraught with uncertainty. Biden's apparent vulnerability and the prospect of Trump's return to power have created a highly charged atmosphere. The decisions made in the coming months will not only shape the future of American politics but also have far-reaching implications for global stability and security.\n\nIn this high-stakes environment, the American electorate faces a crucial choice. Will they opt for continuity with Biden, despite the challenges of his age and performance, or will they take a gamble on Trump, with all the unpredictability that entails? The outcome of this decision will reverberate far beyond the borders of the United States, influencing the course of international relations for years to come.",

        "summary": "The article discusses the recent political challenges faced by U.S. President Joe Biden, particularly during a debate with former President Donald Trump. Biden's performance, hindered by his age, raised concerns about his ability to lead, especially as he seeks re-election. The debate highlighted the harsh scrutiny politicians face, amplified by social media. Within the Democratic Party, there is growing unease about Biden's viability as a candidate, with some suggesting he step aside, a complex and difficult decision. Key figures like Jill Biden and Barack Obama may influence this decision.\n\nThe article also explores the broader implications of the upcoming 2024 election. Trump's potential return to the presidency introduces significant uncertainty, given his unpredictable policies and departure from traditional norms. This has global ramifications, particularly concerning U.S. relations with Russia, China, and European allies, as well as ongoing conflicts in the Middle East. The election's outcome will significantly impact both American politics and international stability, presenting the electorate with a critical choice between continuity with Biden or the unpredictability of Trump."

        "body": "KUALA LUMPUR: CIMB Group Holdings Bhd will no longer provide new dedicated financing for upstream oil fields starting from Jan 1, 2025.\n\nThis is a part of the bank's 2030 decarbonisation targets that was unveiled in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.\n\nThe group stated this policy applied to upstream oil fields approved for development after Dec 31, 2021. To assist its oil and gas (O&G) clients in their decarbonisation efforts, CIMB will also be reducing the Financed Emissions Lending Intensity of its O&G portfolio by 16% by 2030.\n\nCIMB is the first local bank to complete its 2030 decarbonisation target setting for high-emitting sectors. This is part of its broader 2050 net-zero commitments that include thermal coal mining, cement, palm oil and power.\n\nAnother sector was real estate, where the group has announced its target to reduce the operational emissions intensity of its commercial real estate portfolio by 34% by 2030.\n\nAddressing concerns on whether this means the bank will drastically shift away from certain clients, CIMB Malaysia and CIMB Bank chief executive officer Gurdip Singh Sidhu said it will not be the case.\n\n\"We are taking a very consultative and collaborative approach. When we were coming up with these targets, for critical sectors like O&G and palm oil, we engaged with industry players, bodies and major clients to align our targets with their trajectories and plans.\n\n\"Moreover, for all sectors, with the exception of coal, our total outstanding financing with clients is expected to increase leading up to 2030.\n\n\"So, to say that we think by doing this (setting targets) it may negatively affect our business growth, that will certainly not be the case because we are projecting growth in all those sectors,\" he said during the CIMB Sustainability Roundtable 2024.\n\nCIMB has also updated its previously published white paper detailing its decarbonisation plans, delineating sector-specific pathways and immediate strategies for all six sectors, which collectively accounts for 60% of its financing portfolio emissions as of 2023.\n\nGurdip, who also oversees the overall group sustainability efforts in CIMB, said many corporations are already feeling the push towards greener operations due to mechanisms like the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).\n\n\"Many of our clients exporting to Europe will soon realise, if they haven't already, that their products could become marginally less competitive compared to those of producers in other countries with greener operations.\n\n\"This is because products exported from Malaysia may incur higher carbon taxes under the European Union's regulations,\" he said.\n\nNevertheless, Gurdip contends that to assume there would not be any challenges, both internally and externally, in the implementation of the targets would be overly optimistic.\n\n\"We do not foresee internal challenges, like our bankers choosing not to subscribe to this pathway and giving out loans to the coal sector, for example, to be an issue that will curtail us from achieving our targets. We believe we have put enough safeguards in our process,\" he said.\n\n\"The external dependencies and challenges are the ones that we are not in full control of.\n\n\"For instance, the trade off on the balance with a just transition like with the Russia-Ukraine war. The spike in energy prices that took place when the war started created trade-offs between prioritising net-zero goals and securing energy supplies, be it clean or not so clean,\" he said.\n\nEven so, Gurdip said the group remains confident in the momentum towards sustainability, looking at the pace of progress since the company started its sustainability journey in 2019.\n\n\"As we pursue our 2050 goals, we will encounter some speed bumps along the way. However, given that Malaysia is a very big trading country, where exports have a big part, so even if government policies do not move as quickly as what was originally planned, the push and pull factor as a result of things like the CBAM will be a catalyst,\" he said.\n\nIn addition to the 2030 climate targets, CIMB has increased its sustainable finance target to RM100bil by 2024, surpassing RM86.2bil as of December last year.\n\nGurdip said that for large corporations, CIMB has launched the sustainability linked loan facility which the group has committed RM3bil to.\n\n\"We have deployed a certain chunk of that. This is essentially setting targets for clients. It also acts as an incentive for them to achieve those targets, so that they can get rebates on the interest rates of their loan,\" he said.",

        "title": "Dark Star Announces Letter of Intent to Purchase Uranium Assets in the Central Mineral Belt of Newfoundland/Labrador",
        "body": "Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - July 3, 2024) - DARK STAR MINERALS INC. (CSE: BATT) (FSE: P0W) (the \"Company\" or \"Dark Star\") is pleased to announce that the Company has entered into a letter of intent (the \"LOI\") to acquire (the \"Acquisition\") all of the outstanding share capital of Ghost Lake Mining Corp (\"Ghost Lake\"). Ghost Lake holds an option to purchase a 100 % interest in the Ghost Lake mining claims (the \"Property\").\n\nMarc Branson, President, Chief Executive Officer and a director of Dark Star stated: \"We are very excited to expand our exploration prospects into Uranium. This purchase will give the Company the ability to be on the forefront of exploring for critical minerals and fulfilling our mission of creating Canada's energy independence through exploration\".\n\nAbout the Property and Central Mineral Belt\n\nLocated in the prolific Central Mineral Belt (CMB) of Labrador, the Ghost Lake Property consists of 28,575 Ha of contiguous claim blocks. The Property is bound on three sides (N, W, E) by [properties held by] Atha Energy Corp. (the \"Atha Properties\") and overlaps structural trends with known deposits such as Paladin Energy Ltd.'s Michelin Project, Labrador Uranium Inc.'s, and the Mustang Lake and Jacques Lake deposits. The CMB is a diverse geological environment and is host to widespread uranium mineralization. The neighboring Atha Properties host a number of uranium deposits, including the Anna Lake, Moran Lake, and Mustang deposits while Paladin Energy hosts the Michelin Uranium Project. Mineralization on the neighbouring properties is not indicative of potential mineralization on the Ghost Lake Property.\n\nTargets on the Ghost Lake Property focus on areas of Radiometric Uranium highs over 0.5km2 from regional airborne surveys. Primary targets include: Anomaly 24_1, an uranium radiometric anomaly in proximity to historic uranium lake sediment samples, and Anomaly 24_3 (~15km2), which is located along the western margin of Ghost Lake and covers historic \"Anomaly B\". The property wide northeast trending corridor is prospective for structurally related uranium mineralization. The corridor is defined by anomalous uranium lake sediment samples, along a north east trending fault that transects the peripheries of radiometric anomalies.\n\nThe claims overly the southern margin of the CMB, a northeast-trending, 260 x 75 km belt of Proterozoic volcanic and sedimentary rocks and associated granites. The south-western margin of the Project straddles the boundary between granitoid rocks of the Trans Labrador Batholith and the Proterozoic Bruce River Group while the northern edge of the Property overlies a 12km section Mesoarchean Makkovik granitoid gneiss.\n\nBayswater Uranium Corporation performed exploration in the northeast part of the current Ghost Lake Project area between 2006 and 2009. Exploration included an airborne radiometric surveys as well as a ground based radon gas sample grid, along with minimal traverses. Bayswater was successful in identifying distinct radiometric targets around Ghost Lake. Ghost Lake anomaly B occurs at the west end of the lake, within the claim boundaries and is characterized by a distribution of high radiometric values. Bayswater later completed a Radon Gas soil survey over Anomaly B. Survey results from anomaly B indicated several NE-SW anomalous trends of moderate to high radon flux (Third Year Assessment Report on the Labrador, Central Mineral Belt Project , 2009, Fraser, R.D., Thomas, A., Galbraith, C.).\n\nSantory Resources and Mega Uranium completed field work from 2005 - 2008 in the southwest part of the current Ghost Lake Project. The cumulation of their fieldwork including airborne, water, and lake sediment surveys as well as prospecting resulted in identification of a property wide northeast-southwest prospective corridor. The corridor host numerous anomalous uranium lake sediment samples, coinciding with a regional fault along the peripheries of radiometric anomalies (Third Year Assessment Report of Lake Sediment, Lake Water, Surface Water Geochemistry Sampling, and Prospecting on Licenses 10359M, 10779M, 013573, and 013730M Gravelly River Property, Mega Uranium LTD, March 2008,, Gilman, T.L.)\n\n.\n\nSummary of the Acquisition as set out by the LOI\n\nPursuant to the terms of the LOI, the Company and Ghost Lake will enter into a definitive agreement (the \"Agreement\") which will include consideration payable by the Company to Ghost Lake through the issuance of: (i) 10,000,000 common shares of Dark Star (the \"Consideration Shares\"); and (ii) 10,000,000 Dark Star warrants where each warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Dark Star common share, exercisable for a period of two years beginning on the date of the Acquisition, at an exercise price equal to the greater of: (a) $0.20 per share; and (b) the lowest price permitted under the policies of the Canadian Securities Exchange (the \"Warrants\").\n\nThe sole asset of Ghost Lake is an option agreement to acquire 100% of the Ghost Lake mining Claims from Cronin Exploration Inc. (\"Cronin\").

Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as: \"believes\", \"expects\", \"anticipates\", \"intends\", \"estimates\", \"plans\", \"may\", \"should\", \"would\", \"will\", \"potential\", \"scheduled\" or variations of such words and phrases and similar expressions, which, by their nature, refer to future events or results that may, could, would, might or will occur or be taken or achieved. All statements in this news release that are not purely historical are forward-looking statements and include statements regarding beliefs, plans, expectations and orientations regarding the future. Although the Company believes that such statements are reasonable and reflect expectations of future developments and other factors which management believes to be reasonable and relevant, the Company can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. In making the forward-looking statements in this news release, the Company has applied several material assumptions, including without limitation, that market fundamentals will support the viability of critical mineral resource exploration, the availability of the financing required for the Company to carry out its planned future activities, and the availability of and the ability to retain and attract qualified personnel. Other factors may also adversely affect the future results or performance of the Company, including general economic, market or business conditions, future prices of minerals, changes in the financial markets and in the demand for minerals, changes in laws, regulations and policies affecting the mineral exploration industry, as well as the risks and uncertainties which are more fully described in the Company's annual and quarterly management's discussion and analysis and in other filings made by the Company with Canadian securities regulatory authorities under the Company's SEDAR profile. Ongoing labour shortages, inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, the global financial climate and the conflict in Ukraine and surrounding regions are some additional factors that are affecting current economic conditions and increasing economic uncertainty, which may impact the Company's operating performance, financial position, and future prospects. Collectively, the potential impacts of this economic environment pose risks that are currently indescribable and immeasurable. No assurance can be given that any of the events anticipated by the forward-looking statements will occur or, if they do occur, what benefits the Company will obtain from them. Readers are cautioned that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and, accordingly, are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty of such statements. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update such forward‐looking information whether because of new information, future events or otherwise, except as expressly required by applicable law.\n\nNeither the CSE nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the CSE) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.",

        "body": "Marc Branson, President, Chief Executive Officer and a director of Dark Star stated: \"We are very excited to expand our exploration prospects into Uranium. This purchase will give the Company the ability to be on the forefront of exploring for critical minerals and fulfilling our mission of creating Canada's energy independence through exploration\".\n\nAbout the Property and Central Mineral Belt\n\nLocated in the prolific Central Mineral Belt (CMB) of Labrador, the Ghost Lake Property consists of 28,575 Ha of contiguous claim blocks. The Property is bound on three sides (N, W, E) by [properties held by] Atha Energy Corp. (the \"Atha Properties\") and overlaps structural trends with known deposits such as Paladin Energy Ltd.'s Michelin Project, Labrador Uranium Inc.'s, and the Mustang Lake and Jacques Lake deposits. The CMB is a diverse geological environment and is host to widespread uranium mineralization. The neighboring Atha Properties host a number of uranium deposits, including the Anna Lake, Moran Lake, and Mustang deposits while Paladin Energy hosts the Michelin Uranium Project. Mineralization on the neighbouring properties is not indicative of potential mineralization on the Ghost Lake Property.\n\nTargets on the Ghost Lake Property focus on areas of Radiometric Uranium highs over 0.5km from regional airborne surveys. Primary targets include: Anomaly 24_1, an uranium radiometric anomaly in proximity to historic uranium lake sediment samples, and Anomaly 24_3 (~15km), which is located along the western margin of Ghost Lake and covers historic \"Anomaly B\". The property wide northeast trending corridor is prospective for structurally related uranium mineralization. The corridor is defined by anomalous uranium lake sediment samples, along a north east trending fault that transects the peripheries of radiometric anomalies.\n\nThe claims overly the southern margin of the CMB, a northeast-trending, 260 x 75 km belt of Proterozoic volcanic and sedimentary rocks and associated granites. The south-western margin of the Project straddles the boundary between granitoid rocks of the Trans Labrador Batholith and the Proterozoic Bruce River Group while the northern edge of the Property overlies a 12km section Mesoarchean Makkovik granitoid gneiss.\n\nBayswater Uranium Corporation performed exploration in the northeast part of the current Ghost Lake Project area between 2006 and 2009. Exploration included an airborne radiometric surveys as well as a ground based radon gas sample grid, along with minimal traverses. Bayswater was successful in identifying distinct radiometric targets around Ghost Lake. Ghost Lake anomaly B occurs at the west end of the lake, within the claim boundaries and is characterized by a distribution of high radiometric values. Bayswater later completed a Radon Gas soil survey over Anomaly B. Survey results from anomaly B indicated several NE-SW anomalous trends of moderate to high radon flux (Third Year Assessment Report on the Labrador, Central Mineral Belt Project , 2009, Fraser, R.D., Thomas, A., Galbraith, C.).\n\nSantory Resources and Mega Uranium completed field work from 2005 - 2008 in the southwest part of the current Ghost Lake Project. The cumulation of their fieldwork including airborne, water, and lake sediment surveys as well as prospecting resulted in identification of a property wide northeast-southwest prospective corridor. The corridor host numerous anomalous uranium lake sediment samples, coinciding with a regional fault along the peripheries of radiometric anomalies (Third Year Assessment Report of Lake Sediment, Lake Water, Surface Water Geochemistry Sampling, and Prospecting on Licenses 10359M, 10779M, 013573, and 013730M Gravelly River Property, Mega Uranium LTD, March 2008,, Gilman, T.L.)\n\n.\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/9815/215359_68f9b49814486b99_002full.jpg\n\nSummary of the Acquisition as set out by the LOI\n\nPursuant to the terms of the LOI, the Company and Ghost Lake will enter into a definitive agreement (the \"Agreement\") which will include consideration payable by the Company to Ghost Lake through the issuance of: (i) 10,000,000 common shares of Dark Star (the \"Consideration Shares\"); and (ii) 10,000,000 Dark Star warrants where each warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Dark Star common share, exercisable for a period of two years beginning on the date of the Acquisition, at an exercise price equal to the greater of: (a) $0.20 per share; and (b) the lowest price permitted under the policies of the Canadian Securities Exchange (the \"Warrants\").\n\nThe sole asset of Ghost Lake is an option agreement to acquire 100% of the Ghost Lake mining Claims from Cronin Exploration Inc.

        "body": "Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - July 3, 2024) - DARK STAR MINERALS INC. (CSE: BATT) (FSE: P0W) (the \"Company\" or \"Dark Star\") is pleased to announce that the Company has entered into a letter of intent (the \"LOI\") to acquire (the \"Acquisition\") all of the outstanding share capital of Ghost Lake Mining Corp (\"Ghost Lake\"). Ghost Lake holds an option to purchase a 100 % interest in the Ghost Lake mining claims (the \"Property\").\n\nMarc Branson, President, Chief Executive Officer and a director of Dark Star stated: \"We are very excited to expand our exploration prospects into Uranium. This purchase will give the Company the ability to be on the forefront of exploring for critical minerals and fulfilling our mission of creating Canada's energy independence through exploration\".\n\nAbout the Property and Central Mineral Belt\n\nLocated in the prolific Central Mineral Belt (CMB) of Labrador, the Ghost Lake Property consists of 28,575 Ha of contiguous claim blocks. The Property is bound on three sides (N, W, E) by [properties held by] Atha Energy Corp. (the \"Atha Properties\") and overlaps structural trends with known deposits such as Paladin Energy Ltd.'s Michelin Project, Labrador Uranium Inc.'s, and the Mustang Lake and Jacques Lake deposits. The CMB is a diverse geological environment and is host to widespread uranium mineralization. The neighboring Atha Properties host a number of uranium deposits, including the Anna Lake, Moran Lake, and Mustang deposits while Paladin Energy hosts the Michelin Uranium Project. Mineralization on the neighbouring properties is not indicative of potential mineralization on the Ghost Lake Property.\n\nTargets on the Ghost Lake Property focus on areas of Radiometric Uranium highs over 0.5km2 from regional airborne surveys. Primary targets include: Anomaly 24_1, an uranium radiometric anomaly in proximity to historic uranium lake sediment samples, and Anomaly 24_3 (~15km2), which is located along the western margin of Ghost Lake and covers historic \"Anomaly B\". The property wide northeast trending corridor is prospective for structurally related uranium mineralization. The corridor is defined by anomalous uranium lake sediment samples, along a north east trending fault that transects the peripheries of radiometric anomalies.\n\nThe claims overly the southern margin of the CMB, a northeast-trending, 260 x 75 km belt of Proterozoic volcanic and sedimentary rocks and associated granites. The south-western margin of the Project straddles the boundary between granitoid rocks of the Trans Labrador Batholith and the Proterozoic Bruce River Group while the northern edge of the Property overlies a 12km section Mesoarchean Makkovik granitoid gneiss.\n\nBayswater Uranium Corporation performed exploration in the northeast part of the current Ghost Lake Project area between 2006 and 2009. Exploration included an airborne radiometric surveys as well as a ground based radon gas sample grid, along with minimal traverses. Bayswater was successful in identifying distinct radiometric targets around Ghost Lake. Ghost Lake anomaly B occurs at the west end of the lake, within the claim boundaries and is characterized by a distribution of high radiometric values. Bayswater later completed a Radon Gas soil survey over Anomaly B. Survey results from anomaly B indicated several NE-SW anomalous trends of moderate to high radon flux (Third Year Assessment Report on the Labrador, Central Mineral Belt Project , 2009, Fraser, R.D., Thomas, A., Galbraith, C.).\n\nSantory Resources and Mega Uranium completed field work from 2005 - 2008 in the southwest part of the current Ghost Lake Project. The cumulation of their fieldwork including airborne, water, and lake sediment surveys as well as prospecting resulted in identification of a property wide northeast-southwest prospective corridor. The corridor host numerous anomalous uranium lake sediment samples, coinciding with a regional fault along the peripheries of radiometric anomalies (Third Year Assessment Report of Lake Sediment, Lake Water, Surface Water Geochemistry Sampling, and Prospecting on Licenses 10359M, 10779M, 013573, and 013730M Gravelly River Property, Mega Uranium LTD, March 2008\" Gilman, T.L.)\n\n.\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/9815/215359_68f9b49814486b99_002full.jpg\n\nSummary of the Acquisition as set out by the LOI\n\nPursuant to the terms of the LOI, the Company and Ghost Lake will enter into a definitive agreement (the \"Agreement\") which will include consideration payable by the Company to Ghost Lake through the issuance of: (i) 10,000,000 common shares of Dark Star (the \"Consideration Shares\"); and (ii) 10,000,000 Dark Star warrants where each warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Dark Star common share, exercisable for a period of two years beginning on the date of the Acquisition, at an exercise price equal to the greater of: (a) $0.20 per share; and (b) the lowest price permitted under the policies of the Canadian Securities Exchange (the \"Warrants\").\n\nThe sole asset of Ghost Lake is an option agreement to acquire 100% of the Ghost Lake mining Claims from Cronin Exploration Inc. (\"Cronin\").

        "title": "Thank you, Elon Musk",
        "body": "Starlink provides reliable internet service to rural areas\n\nPresident Biden and his pals in the White House don't like Mr. Musk and avoid doing business with him, even when he offers the best solution to problems they say they want to solve.\n\nThat's a mistake.\n\nMr. Biden would say that his products aren't as good as he claims, but even the casual observer knows it's his politics. They used to like Mr. Musk, who said he voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and for Mr. Biden in 2020. In a series of interviews in the early days of the new administration, Mr. Musk said he liked the new president's agenda.\n\nStill, administration officials cut Mr. Musk from discussions promoting electric vehicles because his facilities weren't unionized. In touting electric vehicles, the president refused for months to refer in any way to Mr. Musk or his electric vehicle company, Tesla, and finally threw his support behind legislation that restricts government subsidies to EVs produced by unionized labor.\n\nThen Mr. Musk bought Twitter and released emails that revealed how the Democrats pressured social media companies to help them win the 2020 and 2022 elections. He also began criticizing Mr. Biden's economic plans and announced that he wouldn't vote for Mr. Biden in November. Since then, the White House has been doing all it can to avoid doing business with Mr. Musk despite contracts with his company SpaceX, which is vital to the space program and the communications infrastructure Ukraine relies on in its war with Russia.\n\nJust last week, another stark example of how this political animosity has hurt Americans and the Biden administration's ability to implement its own programs was revealed.\n\nIn 2021, Mr. Biden talked Congress into appropriating $42.5 billion to bring internet service to the underserved corners of rural America. Still, a recent government report reveals that not one more business, house or school has gotten access to the web under his program. The reason: Funding is restricted to potential providers willing to install costly fiber-optic cable in remote areas that could be much more easily and cheaply reached through Mr. Musk's Starlink, a subsidiary of his SpaceX, which relies on satellites rather than cable to reach its customers.\n\nMr. Biden and his Federal Communications Commission rejected Mr. Musk's approach as less reliable than what came before and excluded Starlink as a means of reaching the underserved rural areas of the country.\n\nMr. Musk is best known for the ubiquitous Tesla. Still, he also provides rockets used by the military and private corporations to launch satellites and out-of-the-box solutions to other problems. His Starlink system is a typical Musk solution. He began by rejecting older ways of linking people to the internet, came up with an alternative and then built it just as entrepreneurs used to do.\n\nUkraine had no qualms about Starlink. Their military relies on Mr. Musk's service for communication in the war with Russia. When Vladimir Putin's army invaded, Mr. Musk immediately donated Starlink access and terminals to Ukraine. It is estimated that Mr. Musk provided as much as $100 million worth of equipment and service, and without his assistance, that country might not have survived the early days of the war.\n\nBut one doesn't have to go to Ukraine to find support for Starlink. A million and a half Americans have Starlink and, like the Ukrainian military, beg to differ. For decades, my wife and I spent as much time as we could in rural Montana, but for most of this time, there was little or no practical access to the internet anywhere near our home. I was, at the time, opinion editor of The Washington Times, so I had to review the work of our contributors and get their copy and my own to the paper every day.\n\nThe satellite hookups available at the time never worked, so I drove 35 miles one way every morning to the nearest McDonald's for coffee and Wi-Fi. It was inconvenient, but the chain's reliable Wi-Fi was far better than its hamburgers, and the daily 70-mile round trip became routine.\n\nThen, the local phone company offered a bundle that included cellphone and internet service via satellite. It was expensive, less reliable, and couldn't compare to McDonald's service. It didn't come with coffee, and it worked in only one part of the house.\n\nEventually, my wife came to the rescue, as she often does. She had lobbied for regulations that opened up the satellite industry and was waiting for Mr. Musk's Starlink to provide service in our area. Now, thanks to Elon Musk, we have reliable, fast internet service not just in the house but also in my workshop and on the outside deck, where I can write overlooking one of my favorite trout streams.",

        "summary": "The article discusses the political tension between President Biden and Elon Musk, highlighting how it has impacted the implementation of internet services in rural America. Despite Musk's significant contributions through his companies, such as SpaceX and Starlink, the Biden administration has avoided collaborating with him due to political differences and unionization issues. This avoidance has led to inefficiencies, such as the failure to utilize Starlink's satellite-based internet service to provide connectivity to underserved rural areas, despite a $42.5 billion congressional appropriation in 2021 aimed at solving this problem. The article also notes Musk's critical role in supporting Ukraine's communication infrastructure during its conflict with Russia, contrasting this with the U.S. administration's reluctance to engage with his solutions. The author shares a personal anecdote about the benefits of Starlink in rural Montana, emphasizing the practical advantages of Musk's technology."

        "body": "The recently concluded G7 summit demonstrated to the world that Europe and the United States are determined to deter the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Russia from further aggression, with sanctions introduced against Chinese entities, including financial institutions that provide economic impetus for Russia to maintain its war against Ukraine.\n\nIn the G7 communiqué released on June 14, \"China\" was mentioned a rare 28 times in its elaborating of the Chinese communist regime for threatening geopolitics and peace on issues such as production overcapacity, support for the Russia-Ukraine war, \"militarization, and coercive and intimidation activities\" in the South China Sea, and other issues.\n\nLeaders from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, as well as the European Union, warned the Chinese regime against its support for the Russian war, vowing in the statement to take \"measures against actors in China and third countries that materially support Russia's war machine, including financial institutions, consistent with our legal systems, and other entities in China that facilitate Russia's acquisition of items for its defense industrial base.\"\n\nLi Hengqing, a U.S.-based Chinese economist, told The Epoch Times on June 17 that this G7 summit has reached a consensus against the CCP, a focal point of interest different from the past summits.\n\n\"In the past, those Western countries more or less considering their economic, diplomatic, and political relationship with Communist China, have always dodged naming China (CCP), but this time the G7 has made a major change, sending a clear signal that 'if the CCP furnishes resources to the Russian war, then it will be made to pay a heavy price,\" he said.\n\n\"The U.S. is targeting the CCP as a counterpart bundled with Russia,\" said Henry Wu Chia-lung, macroeconomist and lead economics researcher at Taiwan AIA Capital\n\nMr. Wu shared during the New Tang Dynasty program \"Pinnacle View\" on June 18: \"The U.S. sanctions against Russia have gone through several rafts of escalation, and now they have been further escalated to expand the sanctions against Russia's financial system, including countries with which Russian banks have business dealings, with the obvious intention of targeting the CCP.\"\n\nIt included Hong Kong trading companies that \"route payments related to gold sales through foreign financial institutions back into the Russian financial system.\"\n\nThe Treasury Department also imposed sanctions on key parts of Russia's financial infrastructure, including the Moscow Exchange, as well as its securities depository and the country's largest national clearing center.\n\nIn response, the Russian Stock Exchange suspended on June 13 trading in U.S. dollars and euros in foreign currencies and precious metals, as well as using these two currencies as financial instruments.\n\nOn June 13, the Russian central bank issued 14.2 billion yuan (about $1.96 billion) in loans to commercial banks in Russia for 174.2 billion rubles in a currency swap transaction. The day after, the bank doubled the limit of the currency swap to 20 billion yuan (about $ 2.76 billion).\n\nThe China-Russia Bilateral Local Currency Swap Arrangement was signed earlier in October 2014, when Russia was under sanctions by the West over its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea.\n\nHowever, numerous agricultural and commercial banks in northeastern provinces bordering Russia, including Jilin Bank, Changchun Farmers' and Merchants' Bank, Changchun Development Bank and Yanbian Farmers' and Merchants' Bank, continue to provide \"a freer and more flexible settlement channel for border trade\" through the Cross-Border Inter-Bank Payments System (CIPS) supported by China's central bank, according to multiple Chinese media reports.\n\nThe report said those banks shared ruble channel of Hunchun Bank's ruble channel, and \"given the transactions are mainly settled using the ruble as the currency, not the yuan, this system is outside the regulatory scope of the International Payment System (SWIFT) and won't be directly impacted [by the sanctions].\"\n\nIn this regard, Mr. Li indicated that these small banks are not directly connected to the SWIFT system, which does not mean that they can violate the U.S. and European Union bans and escape sanctions.\n\n\"If the Chinese Communist government continues to support Russia's war against Ukraine in this way, the West will eventually step in and impose sanctions on all Chinese banks. All Chinese banks are more or less state-owned, with shares linked to the Communist regime.\" Mr. Li said.",

        "title": "Fact check: New fakes on Zelenskyy's purported wealth",
        "body": "Did Ukraine's first lady Olena Zelenska just buy a million-dollar sports car? Someone presenting himself as a Paris car salesman has claimed so in a viral Instagram reel. DW's fact-checking team looked into the matter.\n\nUkraine's first lady, Olena Zelenska, has been regularly accused of going on extravagant shopping sprees while her husband, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, sends Ukrainians to war with Russia. Sometimes, she's said to have bought jewelry or a luxury yacht, other times, it was a private estate once belonging to the British royal family.\n\nFalse evidence purporting to show that the president and first lady of Ukraine are living a lavish life and have amassed untold wealth -- financed by corruption -- regularly circulates online. The most recent of these claims suggests the couple bought one or two luxury sports cars from the Italian manufacturer Bugatti as gifts for themselves on a recent trip to Paris.\n\nClaim: Ukrainian First Lady Olena Zelenska just bought a million-dollar luxury sports car.\n\nIn a video first appearing on a now-deleted Instagram account, an individual claiming to work for Groupe Schumacher, a suburban Paris car dealer, declared support for Ukraine and welcomed the Zelenskyys to the \"Bugatti family.\" Since Monday (July 1), the (archived) video has been shared millions of times on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter.\n\nAn article on the French website Verite Cachee (Hidden Truth) even claims to present an invoice for the sale. And a tweet by the notorious fake news disseminator Jackson Hinkle, in which he attempts to prop up the claim by presenting a \"copy\" of the aforementioned \"invoice,\" was seen by no less than 6.5 million X users. So, did Olena Zelenska really put in an order for a €4.5 million ($4.9 million) Bugatti Tourbillon?\n\nDW fact check: False.\n\nThe suburban Paris car dealership referenced in both the video and the invoice is real, and a manager from the business answered a DW inquiry into the online claims with a written response. The dealership said it had nothing to do with the incident, and had filed a complaint with authorities for, among other things, document forgery, identity theft and libel.\n\nThe invoice posted online contains a number of inaccuracies, which lends credence to the dealership's claim that the invoice is a forgery. Mistakes include the misspelling of the Paris suburb Neuilly-sur-Seine in the address line, the omission of obligatory sales tax information, and no mention of method of payment -- in fact, no currency is listed at all in the document.\n\nThe since-deleted video itself also raised a number of questions. The person in it moved in a suspiciously stiff manner, and his gestures as well as the tone of his voice did not seem to fit the news he was announcing. The speaker's French was full of mistakes, and his words were oddly inarticulate.\n\nAlthough these impressions could be considered subjective, the account itself also offered evidence to suggest that the video was fake.\n\nThe since-deleted Instagram account jacqes_bertin_ls was said to belong to \"automobile salesman\" Jacques Bertin. However, DW was unable to find images or references to any such a person online other than in relation to the one video in question.\n\nAll in all, the clues investigated by DW suggested that rather than being a real person, the speaker featured in the video was likely a composite created with artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe \"news\" site where the story first appeared online offers the third indication that the story was fabricated. Although the text of the story was made to look like a normal tabloid article and offered enough detail to make it appear as if it had been generated with AI, the site itself contains the hallmarks of a troll site.\n\nIt has no masthead, no author names, no picture information and no publication dates for any of its articles. Moreover, the page's jumbled layout, skewed images and awkwardly cropped images are all the likely result of sloppy programming.\n\nPerhaps the biggest red flag is the fact that nearly every article featured on the page starts with the words \"Voici un titre court pour l'article\" (Here's a short title for the article). This gives rise to the suspicion that someone, or something (like a computer program) tasked an AI chatbot with creating titles for articles and then posted the entire response on the page.\n\nThe way the false claim was distributed conforms to a pattern that has become familiar when dealing with Russian propaganda.\n\nFirstly, fake information is conceived and packaged in a way that will further the interests of the creator -- in this case, the targeted defamation of Ukraine's president.\n\nAfter that, a fake is constructed to push the false claim -- in the form of a social media video, a spoofing production (imitating an established media outlet) or a manipulated photo -- these are often created with the help of AI, or a standard image processing program.\n\nIn the next step, a fake news portal -- such as Verite Cachee -- picks up the story. Then relevant social media accounts begin sharing the story at more or less the same time. The fake stories then spread like wildfire as a result of the large numbers of followers that such X, Facebook, Telegram or TikTok accounts have.\n\nNevertheless, the claim might not be entirely baseless. The Pandora Papers, published in 2021 by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists suggest that Zelenskyy is the owner of an offshore shell company and may have profited from a billion-dollar corruption scheme by Ukrainian oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky.",

        "title": "The Rising Sun: Japan's Strategic Re-Awakening and the Art of Balance in the Indo-Pacific - The Geopolitics",
        "body": "Japan's recent pivot towards a robust defense posture and its longstanding economic prowess in East Asia present a paradigm shift. Japan's defense budget for 2021 was approximately 5.34 trillion yen ($48.56 billion), marking a continuous increase for the ninth consecutive year and setting a new record for the country. This evolution is not merely a reaction to the contemporary crescendo of tensions but a thoughtful, deliberate stride informed by a rich historical consciousness and a profound philosophical underpinning. More specifically, the Japanese government, in its 2020 Defense White Paper, explicitly identified China as a significant strategic challenge, underscoring the escalating tensions in the East China Sea, especially around the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands. Hence, the unveiling of Japan's new defense strategy by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida marks a pivotal moment, symbolizing a nation ready to navigate the delicate balance between its pacifist constitution and the exigencies of an increasingly precarious international landscape.\n\nA New Zero From the Rising Sun\n\nJapan's decision to bolster its military capabilities, with a significant investment in U.S.-made Tomahawk cruise missiles, represents a recalibration of its strategic posture. Critics argue this move contravenes the pacifist ethos enshrined in Japan's post-war constitution, yet it reflects a deeper, existential deliberation about national security and sovereignty. This strategic augmentation, positioning Japan as the third-largest military spender globally, is not merely an accumulation of martial prowess but a statement of intent and a redefinition of Japan's role on the world stage.\n\nEchoes of Past Imperialism\n\nThe critique from regional adversaries like North Korea, Russia, and China, although steeped in historical grievances, underscores the transformative potential of Japan's new trajectory. China's response, in particular, highlights the dialectic of power and perception in regional geopolitics, framing Japan's military enhancement as a deviation from a peaceful path. Yet, this narrative belies a more complex reality of a region in flux, where economic influence, strategic partnerships, and military deterrence are intricately intertwined. For example, it was the specter of the Ukrainian crisis that crystallized Japan's resolve, serving as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities inherent in the existing world order. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, in various statements, has drawn parallels between the situation in Ukraine and potential future conflicts in Asia, suggesting that Japan views the Ukrainian crisis as a cautionary tale for its security planning (Nikkei Asia, 2021). The notion that Ukraine's today could be Asia's tomorrow has spurred Tokyo into action, catalyzing a reevaluation of its defense doctrine. This recalibration towards a more proactive defense posture is infused with the wisdom of Japanese philosophy, acknowledging that true strength lies not just in the ability to defend but to deter.\n\nA Velvet Gloving Gripping the Samurai\n\nJapan's economic influence in Southeast Asia is a testament to its soft power and strategic foresight. Japan's commitment to infrastructure development in Southeast Asia is evident through its leading role in projects like the Jakarta Mass Rapid Transit system in Indonesia and the North-South Commuter Railway in the Philippines, totaling investments that significantly surpass those of China's Belt and Road Initiative in the region (Asian Development Bank, 2020). As such, Japan has cultivated a sphere of influence that extends beyond mere economic transactions.\n\nThe Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has been pivotal in providing low-interest loans for infrastructure projects across Southeast Asia, emphasizing Japan's approach to win goodwill and influence through economic means rather than coercive debt practices often associated with China's investments (JICA Annual Report, 2020). This approach, characterized by favorable loan terms and a respect for sovereignty, are not just investments in the future prosperity of Southeast Asia but also in the stability and security of the Indo-Pacific region and stands in stark contrast to the debt-laden overtures often associated with Chinese projects.\n\nBushido in Diplomacy\n\nThe philosophical underpinnings of Japan's strategic pivot can be traced to the nuanced legacy of Bushido, the way of the warrior. This ethos, characterized by honor, loyalty, and courage, informs Japan's approach to leadership and responsibility on the international stage. The transition from a pacifist posture to a proactive defense strategy reflects a broader societal acknowledgment of the changing dynamics of global power and the imperatives of national security. Japan's pivot to a more assertive defense posture while maintaining its pacifist principles illustrates the application of Bushido's values in contemporary geopolitical strategy.\n\nThe Rising Sun Rising Again\n\nJapan's significant investments in defense, infrastructure, and technological innovation are part of its broader vision to play a more proactive role in ensuring regional stability. Initiatives like the Quad (Quadrilateral Security Dialogue) involving Japan, the United States, India, and Australia, exemplify Japan's commitment to contributing to a stable and secure Indo-Pacific region (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan, 2021).\n\nAs Japan navigates this strategic evolution, it does so with an acute awareness of its historical legacies and the contemporary challenges that shape the Indo-Pacific landscape. The investment in defense, infrastructure, and technological innovation is indicative of a nation that seeks to redefine its role, not as a mere participant in the international system but as a pivotal architect of a more balanced, stable, and prosperous regional order.\n\nThis strategic re-awakening, while fraught with obstacles, is informed by the lessons of living history, the imperatives of the eternal present, and the possibilities of a self-made future. As Japan continues to shape its path, it does so with the grace of the samurai, the foresight of the strategist, and the commitment of a nation poised to play a defining role in the Indo-Pacific theater. The rising sun, emblematic of Japan's national flag, thus symbolizes not just the dawn of a new day but the emergence of a new paradigm in the delicate dance of power, principle, and peace in the 21st century.\n\n[Photo by 海上自衛隊, via Wikimedia Commons]",

        "title": "Reimagining Russian Warfare: The Transformation in the Ukraine Conflict - The Geopolitics",
        "body": "In the crucible of the Ukraine conflict, Russian forces have embarked on a radical transformation of their armored warfare strategies. This evolution, epitomized by the emergence of advanced infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) and the so-called \"turtle tanks,\" reveals a broader strategic shift and underscores Russia's commitment to maintaining its military edge in an increasingly drone-dominated battlefield.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has entered a potentially perilous phase as Russia deploys a new generation of IFVs to the front lines. The BMP-3 and BMD-4M are not mere troop carriers; they represent the pinnacle of modern military engineering, bristling with firepower, agility, and robust armor designed to shield soldiers on the battlefield. Their introduction signals a profound shift in Russia's military strategy, raising concerns of further escalation in an already devastating conflict.\n\nIn tandem with this deployment, there has been a notable 20% increase in BMP-3 production by Kurganmashzavod, a powerhouse in Russia's defense industry. This translates to Russian forces receiving 50% more of these vehicles in 2024 compared to the previous year, highlighting the resilience of Russia's domestic military production despite severe international sanctions. The question arises: what capabilities do these new IFVs bring to the fight, and what are the potential consequences of their deployment on the battlefield?\n\nThe BMP-3 and BMD-4M are the backbone of Russia's mechanized infantry. To grasp their significance, one must understand the Soviet military doctrine that shaped their development. Post-World War II, the Soviet Red Army emphasized heavily armored formations capable of breaching enemy lines. This philosophy extended to their infantry fighting vehicles. The BMP-1, for example, was armed but vulnerable, sitting tall and unable to swim, making it an easy target.\n\nThe BMP-3, introduced in the 1980s, addressed these shortcomings with a design capable of conquering both water and mountainous terrain. It boasts a formidable 100mm main gun capable of firing high-explosive shells and anti-tank missiles, making it versatile enough to handle enemy troops, fortified positions, and tanks. Additionally, a 30mm autocannon and a coaxial 7.62mm machine gun provide a barrage of firepower against lighter targets and helicopters. The BMP-3's adaptability extends to its mobility with water jets for amphibious operations and a sophisticated suspension system for navigating rough terrain.\n\nThe BMD-4M, in contrast, traces its lineage to the Cold War's emphasis on airborne assaults. Designed to be lightweight and maneuverable, it can be parachuted into combat zones and dominate the battlefield once deployed. The BMD-4M retains the BMP-3's powerful armament but is enhanced with improved fire control systems for greater precision. It also features anti-tank guided missiles, offering substantial armor-piercing capabilities. Its lightweight design includes an NBC (nuclear, biological, chemical) protection system, safeguarding the crew from various threats.\n\nDespite their advanced design, the brutal realities of the Ukrainian conflict have tested these vehicles under harsh conditions. They have proven vulnerable to sophisticated anti-tank weapons and drone tactics employed by Ukrainian forces. In response, Russia's Kurganmashzavod is rapidly deploying upgraded versions of these IFVs to the front lines. Recent modifications include bar armor on the sides and cage structures over the turrets to deflect RPGs and drone-mounted explosives, enhancing their survivability.\n\nThese upgrades are complemented by the Nakidka thermal camouflage system, which reduces the vehicle's thermal signature, making it harder for enemy forces to detect. Additionally, the RP-377VM1L jamming system disrupts the communication between drones and their operators, potentially neutralizing drone threats. While these enhancements represent significant advancements, their real-world effectiveness remains to be fully tested.\n\nIn a fascinating adaptation to modern warfare, Russian forces have also introduced \"turtle tanks\" -- a peculiar yet effective response to the increasing threat posed by Ukrainian FPV drones. Initially, these tanks were local improvisations characterized by makeshift counter-FPV drone shelters fabricated from available materials. Early iterations featured simple metal sheets hastily affixed to the tanks, creating an armored shell designed to protect against drone attacks. Despite their rudimentary appearance, these modifications have proven remarkably effective in the field.\n\nFootage from late April captured a Russian armored assault near Krashna Harfa, showcasing a column of infantry fighting vehicles equipped with these counter-FPV shelters. The lead tank, protected by a cope cage, spearheaded the assault, effectively clearing mines with its plow before retreating to safety. This tactic underscores the tanks' dual role: mine clearance and providing cover for advancing units.\n\nBy early May, the design of turtle tanks had further evolved. Images from UAVs revealed T-62 tanks with hybrid shelters, combining chain link, grating, and reactive armor. These modifications illustrate a blurring of the lines between traditional cope cages and the new turtle shells. The incorporation of electronic warfare (EW) modules and mine plows underscores a comprehensive approach to battlefield threats.\n\nDespite these innovations, the turtle tanks are not invulnerable. Videos from May showed several instances of these tanks being damaged or destroyed by mines and FPV drone attacks. One particularly striking example involved a turtle tank immobilized by a mine, subsequently attacked by multiple FPV drones. This highlights a significant vulnerability: while the shells offer protection, they are not foolproof against concentrated attacks.\n\nThe proliferation of turtle tanks across various Russian units, including the 40th Naval Infantry Brigade, indicates a decentralized yet widespread adoption of this concept. This suggests that the Russian military recognizes the value of these modifications and is willing to experiment with different designs to enhance their effectiveness.\n\nHowever, the reliance on makeshift solutions also points to a potential weakness: the lack of a unified, centrally coordinated approach to countering drone threats. As the conflict continues, it is likely that both Russian and Ukrainian forces will continue to adapt their tactics, leading to an ongoing cycle of measure and countermeasure.\n\nThe introduction of these upgraded IFVs represents a double-edged sword. The additional armor and jamming systems provide critical defense against drone strikes and RPG attacks. However, their impact on the war's trajectory is uncertain. Ukrainian forces are likely to adapt their tactics, and these upgrades will not transform these IFVs into invincible war machines. Nonetheless, the improvements may offer enhanced protection for Russian troops, potentially reducing casualties and enabling more aggressive maneuvers.\n\nIn the evolving theater of modern warfare, the significance of drones has grown exponentially, transforming battle strategies and posing unprecedented challenges to traditional armored vehicles. Recognizing this paradigm shift, Russia has embarked on an ambitious project to revolutionize its military hardware, particularly its iconic T-90 series tanks, to counter the ever-increasing threat of drone warfare.\n\nThe T-90 series, a cornerstone of Russian military might, has undergone significant transformations to maintain its dominance on the battlefield. The latest iteration, the T-90M \"Proryv-3,\" showcases remarkable advancements in armor, firepower, and electronic warfare capabilities. This state-of-the-art tank is designed to adapt to the rapidly changing dynamics of modern conflict, where drones play a pivotal role in reconnaissance, surveillance, and offensive operations.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin himself has lauded the T-90M as the world's premier battle tank, a sentiment echoed by Russian state media following its deployment in Ukraine in late December 2022. This deployment marked a critical moment in Russia's military strategy, as the T-90M began to engage in active combat against sophisticated adversaries equipped with advanced anti-tank systems and precision-guided munitions.\n\nA recent photo circulating on Russian social media has captured the attention of military analysts worldwide. It depicts a T-90M tank fitted with a new anti-drone armor system, a significant departure from the previously seen \"cope cages\" on the tank's turret. This upgrade features symmetrical armor plates on either side of the turret, a design aimed at enhancing the tank's resilience against drone strikes.\n\nThese modifications are not merely cosmetic; they represent a meticulously engineered response to the growing prevalence of FPV (First-Person View) drones. The new armor plates, positioned approximately 20 inches above the main armor, provide a robust shield against aerial attacks targeting the tank's turret. Additionally, the installation of a jammer on the turret's rear, protected by another armor plate, further strengthens the tank's defenses against drone-delivered ordnance.\n\nThe enhanced armor of the T-90M is a testament to Russia's commitment to staying ahead in the drone warfare game. These upgrades are tailored to mitigate the specific threats posed by drones, which have become a persistent challenge on the modern battlefield. However, the threat landscape is multifaceted. While these enhancements improve the tank's survivability against drones, they do not fully eliminate the risks posed by advanced anti-tank weapons such as the FGM-148 Javelin or the Bonus and SMArt 155 submunitions.\n\nThe strategic importance of these upgrades cannot be overstated. By bolstering the T-90M's armor and integrating advanced electronic countermeasures, Russia aims to enhance the tank's operational effectiveness and longevity in combat. The new design also ensures comprehensive protection for critical components such as the engine and transmission, further safeguarding the tank's mobility and functionality.\n\nDespite these advancements, the real-world efficacy of these upgrades remains to be thoroughly tested in active combat scenarios. The success of the T-90M's new armor system will depend on its ability to withstand the multifaceted threats it faces, from drone strikes to advanced anti-tank missiles. Military analysts speculate that these modifications represent the initial phase of a broader strategy to modernize Russia's armored fleet, with the potential for similar enhancements to be applied to other tanks, such as the T-72B3, in the near future.\n\nThe transformation of Russian armored tactics in the Ukraine war, exemplified by the development and deployment of turtle tanks and advanced IFVs, reflects a broader trend towards improvisation and rapid adaptation on the modern battlefield. These innovations, while effective to a degree, also expose new vulnerabilities and challenges. As both sides continue to evolve their strategies, the lessons learned from these adaptations will likely influence armored warfare tactics for years to come.\n\nThe BMP-3 and BMD-4M's upgrades are a clear indication that Russia is acutely aware of the changing dynamics of warfare and is taking proactive steps to ensure its armored vehicles remain formidable adversaries in the face of new and emerging threats. As the conflict in Ukraine continues to evolve, the effectiveness and impact of these formidable machines will undoubtedly play a crucial role in shaping its outcome.\n\n[Representational image, by Vitaly V.

        "title": "Fluctuating Relations: What Are the Current Dynamics Between Poland and the EU? - The Geopolitics",
        "body": "Poland is the most important EU member state in Eastern Europe and plays a pivotal role in the EU's foreign policy dynamics. Joining the EU in 2004 was a crucial moment in the European integration process that marked the country's commitment to democracy, market economy, and collective security. However, its foreign policy journey has not always been smooth, reflected in the tension between aspirations for national sovereignty and engagement in the much deeper process of EU integration.\n\nOver the past few decades, Poland has faced a series of challenges that have affected its foreign policy outlook and implementation at the EU level. One of the most contentious issues in Polish domestic politics and its relations with the EU is the migration crisis. In June 2023, the EU finally passed the reformed Immigration and Asylum Seekers Law after a long delay. The Immigration and Asylum Act was agreed to share the burden of refugees fairly between member states. Poland refused to agree to this due to its skepticism of EU migration quotas, which it sees as a threat to national sovereignty and social stability. Around one million immigrants from Ukraine have voluntarily settled in Poland since the beginning of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but if Poland agrees to the refugee burden, it will only add more social and security problems to Poland's already alarming population due to the lack of birthrates and a dwindling working-age population using immigrant labor due to the labor crisis.\n\nThis step taken by Poland is not only in its national interest but is also supported by other actors within the European Union itself. The Visegrad Group, comprising Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, formed in 1991 as a regional forum to accelerate integration into the European Union, has been transformed into a political alliance that addresses economic and security issues, particularly migration policy. As part of this group, Poland maintains its cultural identity and regional security by changing its immigration policy which tends to pay more attention to cultural identity but still adapts to global demands. In this sense, Poland's policy changes reflect the complex dynamics involving interactions with neighboring countries and perspectives within the Visegrad group.\n\nMoreover, in 2021, the narrative of \"Polexit\" or Poland's exit from the European Union also emerged, which became a controversial issue in Polish politics. Although no concrete steps have been taken in this direction, speculation about the possibility of Poland leaving the EU has reflected domestic political uncertainty and its potential impact on regional stability. Polexit has also reflected some Poles' resentment of EU policies that are perceived as intervening too far in domestic affairs, especially in sensitive issues such as the judicial system, rule of law, and media freedom.\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine war also highlighted Poland's important role in Eastern European security. As a country that shares a border with Ukraine, Poland has been a pioneer in supporting sanctions against Russia and strengthening NATO's military presence in the region. Poland's response to Russian aggression also emphasizes the country's importance as a key ally in maintaining stability in Eastern Europe.\n\nHowever, Poland also faces major challenges in terms of democratic values and civil liberties at home. Issues such as the judicial system, rule of law, and media freedom have raised serious concerns at the EU and international levels. The Polish government under the Prawo i Sprawiedliwość (PiS) or Right-Wing Party of Poland passed laws that threatened the independence of judicial institutions and restricted media freedom, drawing criticism from various quarters that questioned Poland's commitment to the fundamental principles of the European Union.\n\nDespite these fluctuations in relations between Poland and the EU, Poland has an opportunity to play a strategic role in supporting Eastern European integration. This would not only strengthen Poland's position within the EU but also help realize a more robust and unified vision for European integration as a whole. With this in mind, Poland's role in EU foreign policy is not just about navigating current challenges but also about taking the initiative to shape a more stable and integrated future for the EU as a whole. By addressing internal tensions and responding coherently to global challenges, Poland can play an important role in promoting security and stability in Europe.\n\nIf we try to keep looking ahead, Poland's engagement in the EU will continue to be tested by complex domestic political dynamics and the demands of adapting to an increasingly changing security environment in Europe. Polexit, as a controversial issue, reflects not only the divisions in Polish politics but also its potential impact on the stability and strength of the EU as a whole. Therefore, the challenges and opportunities faced by Poland in EU foreign policy cannot be separated from the discussion about the future of European integration and Poland's role within it.\n\n[Photo by Kpalion, via Wikimedia Commons]",

        "title": "An overview of the French elections | Explained",
        "body": "The story so far:\n\nThe first phase of the French elections conducted on June 30, after President Emmanuel Macron's sudden decision to dissolve parliament, has placed the far-right National Rally (RN) and its allies in the lead with a 33% vote share. The New Popular Front, a left-wing coalition, came second with 28%, while Mr. Macron's centrist bloc got only 20.7% of the vote share. The second phase will be held on July 7.\n\nWhy elections now?\n\nOn June 9, Mr. Macron stated that he was dissolving parliament, three years too soon, observing that \"France needs a clear majority if it is to act in serenity and harmony\". This announcement came after his bloc's devastating defeat at the hands of the RN in the European Parliament elections. While the decision came as a shock to most of his party members and allies, Marine Le Pen, the RN leader, welcomed the decision, claiming, \"we're ready for it\".\n\nExperts say Mr. Macron's decision was an attempt to stop the rise of the RN. His gamble was that the French public, faced with the choice of having a far-right party in power, would consolidate against the right-wing wave. However, if that was indeed the reasoning, it seems as if Mr. Macron placed the wrong bet. Almost all opinion polls by major outlets were predicting a lead for the RN (but short of an absolute majority), while Mr. Macron's approval ratings hit rock-bottom to 36%, according to a Toluna-Harris Interactive poll.\n\nThe sudden call for elections and the high stakes involved in the race has energised the electorate, with the Interior Ministry stating that 59.4% of registered voters had cast a ballot as of 5 p.m. on June 30, as compared to the 39.4% at the same time two years ago.\n\nHow are elections in France conducted?\n\nThere are 577 seats in the French parliament, which include 13 overseas districts and 11 constituencies that represent French citizens abroad. So to hold an absolute majority in parliament, a party needs 289 seats.\n\nThe first phase of the elections is equivalent to a qualifying round wherein candidates must at least get 12.5% of locally registered votes in order to stay in the race and not get eliminated. If a candidate gets more than half of the total votes cast in the first round itself, they will automatically win. If not, candidates who have met the qualifying criteria will move on to the second phase. At this stage of the elections, 'horse-trading' is a common practice wherein parties form blocs among themselves and drop candidates in constituencies which may split the vote and favour a rival party/alliance.\n\nThe 2024 snap elections are mainly a three-way battle between the RN and its allies, the New Popular Front, the left-wing coalition which include the Socialists, the Greens, the Communists and France Unbowed, and Ensemble, which is Mr. Macron's bloc.\n\nWhat is at stake?\n\nThe RN, founded as the National Front (FN), was established by Ms. Le Pen's father, Jean Marie Le Pen. The FN was an offshoot of a fascist organisation created as a reaction against the Algerian war, the formation of the Fifth French republic and the protests of May 1968 in France. However, under Ms. Le Pen, the party has undergone a significant rebranding wherein she has sought to whitewash the party's fascist roots as well as her father's Holocaust denial and anti-Semitism. By changing the name of the party from FN to RN, Ms. Le Pen also softened the organisation's once hardcore policies such as leaving the EU and opting out of the euro, the region's currency. Additionally, ever since the Russia-Ukraine war and the subsequent energy crisis, the party has actively distanced itself from Russian President Vladimir Putin with whom Ms. Le Pen once kept close ties.\n\nHowever, in other aspects, the RN is as far-right as it always was. The policy of 'national priority', which the RN espouses, gives French citizens the first choice when it comes to social housing, employment and social benefits -- a scheme which goes against the French Constitution. Similarly, the RN is completely opposed to immigration. It calls for the deportation of all 'illegal' immigrants and strict border controls, and characterises immigrants as destroying the 'European way of life'. The party has also promised to abolish citizenship by birth to children born to parents of foreign descent.\n\nThus, the RN has risen to popularity within the French republic due to fears of culture clashes, a cost-of-living crisis and Mr. Macron's unpopular policies such as increasing the age of retirement. It increased its seat share in the French parliament from seven to 89 in 2022 and now hopes for it to jump as high as anywhere between 240 to 300 seats. Moreover, the party has also been able to tap into the electorate in the provincial towns and villages of southern France, mostly composed of blue-collar workers who have often felt neglected by the political elites of Paris.\n\nMr. Macron's political gamble could potentially lead to France being ruled by a far-right party for the first time since the end of the Second World War. Already there have been reports of a rise in racist attacks, along with anti-far-right protests in many parts of Paris on June 30, some of which ended in violence and arson. The political uncertainty has stoked fear in immigrants and minority communities, particularly among Muslim groups who have often been attacked by the RN.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAs the date for registering the final list of candidates who will be contesting from various constituencies is over, more than 200 candidates from the centre and left alliances have dropped out of the race in order to consolidate votes against the RN.\n\nThe sudden formation of the New Popular front (a reference to the 1936 Popular Front where Socialists and Communists allied against far-right rioters), is part of a practice known as the \"republican front\", wherein centrist and left parties' team up to keep right-wing parties out of power. However, whether the 'front' will hold this time is questionable, especially considering the presence of leftist leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a controversial figure who was accused of anti-Semitism by his rivals.\n\nThe president of the RN and its Prime Ministerial candidate, Jordan Bardella, has stated that he won't enter into an alliance with any of the other blocs. He said he didn't want to be the \"President's assistant\" and that he would rather be a 'cohabitation Prime Minister' as accorded by the French Constitution. A cohabitation is where the President is part of one party and Parliament is ruled by a party not of the President's. Here, domestic policy is governed by the Prime Minister and his Cabinet while defence and foreign policy are handled by the President's office. Mr. Bardella, like his patron Ms. Le Pen, promises that he would prioritise French citizens and bring more purchasing power into their hands by reducing VAT on essential products such as fuel, food, etc.\n\nThe last time a snap election was called was in 1997, when centre-right President Jacques Chirac dissolved the National Assembly to consolidate his party's dominance after a slew of unpopular policies surrounding fiscal austerity. However, his gamble backfired as a new left-wing government came to power inadvertently entering him into a cohabitation alliance. By next week, one would know whether Mr. Macron's decision will also go the same way, and whether his party will be, as Ms. Le Pen stated, \"wiped out\" by the RN.\n\nRead Comments",

        "body": "New multi-country polling report reports sustained public support for the delivery of weapons and ammunition to Ukraine, but shows divisions on how the war will end - and the purpose of European aid.\n\nIt is published by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) on Wednesday, just ahead of the 2024 NATO Summit.\n\nIt suggests NATO leaders are unlikely to find domestic backing for troop deployments or increases in defence spending to assist the war effort.\n\nFollowing the dramatic delay of a critical US support package for Ukraine earlier this year, a political shift in Europe towards populist parties of the far-right, and the recent intensification of Russian military attacks against critical infrastructure in Ukraine, the report found that there has been no discernible collapse of morale in Ukraine or change in support for the Ukrainian war effort among its European allies.\n\nIt reveals, almost two and half years into Russia's invasion of the country, that a majority of Ukrainians (58%) believe they can secure a battlefield victory, and that confidence in the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the country's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, remains high. However, there are major divisions in Ukraine when it comes to prospective trade-offs that could bring an end to the conflict.\n\nThe study's authors and foreign policy experts, Ivan Krastev and Mark Leonard, believe looming divergences of opinion between European and Ukrainian publics could make finding agreement on how the war should end extremely challenging - and have significant impacts on Kyiv's pathway to NATO and EU accession.\n\nLeonard, co-author and founding director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, told this site: \"Our new polling suggests that one of the key challenges for Western leaders will be reconciling the conflicting positions between Europeans and Ukrainians on how the war will end. While both groups recognise the need for continued military provision, to help Ukraine push back at Russian aggression, there is a profound gulf around what constitutes a victory - and what the purpose of Europe's support actually is.\n\n\"While Europeans predominantly see a negotiated settlement as the most likely outcome, Ukrainians are not yet ready to countenance territorial trade-offs for NATO accession, nor engage with the idea of 'Finlandisation', in which they would keep their territory but forgo their EU and NATO ambitions.\"\n\nThe report is based on a public opinion poll of adult populations (aged 18 and over) conducted in May 2024 in 15 countries (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, Poland, Portugal, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and Ukraine). The total number of respondents was 19,566.\n\nThe poll was conducted online by Datapraxis and YouGov in the Czech Republic (9-16 May, 1,071 respondents), France (9-20 May, 1,502),Germany (9-17 May, 2,026), Great Britain (9-13 May, 2,082), Greece (1-16 May, 1,093), Italy (9-17 May, 1,036), Poland (9-23 May, 1,550), Portugal (9-20 May, 1,070), the Netherlands (9-15 May, 1,014), Spain (9-17 May, 1,508), Sweden (9-23 May, 1,026), and Switzerland (2-15 May, 1,079).",

        "summary": "A new report by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) reveals sustained public support in Europe for supplying weapons to Ukraine, but highlights divisions on how the war should end and the purpose of European aid. Published ahead of the 2024 NATO Summit, the report suggests NATO leaders may struggle to gain domestic support for troop deployments or increased defense spending. Despite recent political shifts in Europe and intensified Russian attacks, Ukrainian morale and support from European allies remain strong. The report, based on a May 2024 poll of 19,566 adults across 15 countries, shows that 58% of Ukrainians believe in a battlefield victory and maintain high confidence in President Zelenskyy and the Armed Forces. However, there are significant differences between European and Ukrainian views on ending the conflict, with Europeans favoring a negotiated settlement and Ukrainians rejecting territorial trade-offs for NATO accession. The findings indicate potential challenges for Western leaders in reconciling these conflicting positions, which could impact Ukraine's path to NATO and EU membership."

        "body": "A conservative writer argues that his country's rulers exhibit the vices of youth, not old age\n\nThe discombobulated performance that President Joe Biden gave at the first presidential debate on June 27th sent Democratic Party loyalists, and the journalists who staff the television stations they watch, into a state of shock. It shouldn't have.\n\nBiden's condition has been no mystery to those who work closely with him, nor to daily reporters who have had ever less access to his ever less frequent public appearances. His administration has been marked by malapropisms, confabulations and confusion. \"Incidents\" have multiplied of late - staring emptily amid a frenzy of gospel music and dancing on the White House lawn in mid-June, \"freezing\" on stage before being led off by former president Barack Obama at a Hollywood fundraiser. Indeed, the Biden who appeared before more than 50m Americans at the debate has been with us for quite some time.\n\nOne telling moment came at a February campaign rally in Las Vegas, as Biden tried to rouse the crowd with a story about a summit in Cornwall in 2021. \"Right after I was elected\", he began, \"I went to a 7 meeting in southern England. And I sat down and said, 'America is back!' and Mitterrand from Germany - I mean France - looked at me and said, 'How long you back for?'\" Biden might well have asked the same of François Mitterrand, president of France at the end of the cold war. After all, Mitterrand had been dead since 1996.\n\nA few days later, surprised by a question at a tightly controlled press conference, he seemed to confuse Egypt's Abdel Fattah al-Sisi with the president of Mexico. The press conference had been hastily called after a Justice Department report found that Biden had mishandled classified documents, a criminal offence. The prosecutor declined to press charges only because the president, whom he called \"a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory\", was someone no jury would think capable of committing a crime \"that requires a mental state of wilfulness\".\n\nIt would be natural under the circumstances for voters to ask some uncomfortable questions. If the president lacks the wilfulness to store a document properly, how would he find the power of concentration to manage a multi-front war, or the command of detail to balance a budget, or the common sense to know which foreign leaders to trust? Biden is the oldest president in American history, and the oldest candidate ever to stand for the office.\n\nVoters can throw him out, of course. But the gaffes of the debate bring a deeper problem into focus. Looming behind an adjacent podium that Thursday night was Donald Trump - at 78 years old the second oldest candidate ever to stand, and one to whom various other unflattering superlatives have been attached.\n\nWhat happened? Americans have come to realise that their country is no longer the youthful and forward-looking society it took itself for in the Clinton, Bush junior and Obama years. It is faced with a choice between two ancient and unpopular politicians, which increasingly feels like the only kind of leader America has. Until last year the country's most powerful legislative post, speaker of the House, was also held by its oldest-ever-occupant, 82-year-old Nancy Pelosi. Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell is 82 as well. The Republican delegation to the powerful Senate Budget Committee is led by 90-year-old Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who was elected during the Carter administration.\n\nSuch an elderly profile for the Senate is not wholly regrettable. The upper chamber is supposed to be a place of tradition, good manners and bipartisan comity - and voters tend to like it that way. Unfortunately the loudest and most social-media-savvy parts of the public are an exception. When Democratic senator Dianne Feinstein embraced Republican senator Lindsey Graham to congratulate him on a well-run confirmation hearing in 2020, her own party's Twitter activists demanded she leave the Senate. They got their wish last autumn when she died in office at the age of 90.\n\nWe have heard about \"gerontocracies\" - societies ruled by elders far past their prime, out of touch and yet untouchable, preserving a frozen system from some previous era. They make for pitiable scenes: China in the last confused years of Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai in the early 1970s; or the Soviet Union a decade later, ruled in turn by Leonid Brezhnev on his deathbed, Yuri Andropov on his dialysis machine, and Konstantin Chernenko struggling to catch his breath in public. China and the , of course, were dictatorships. Their leaders naturally resisted being replaced. But that's partly what makes it so alarming to see the United States failing to inject fresh blood into the body politic.\n\nMost societies have been inclined, or liable, to be ruled by older people. Up to a point this is common sense: the old, we assume, have experience and wisdom. The Roman senate that gives its name to ours derives from the word senex, or \"old man\". The Spartan senate was called the Gerousia - a name meaning \"council of elders\" that has occasionally been used by the Greek republic for its upper house, most recently in the 1920s and 1930s. Its members were called gerontes - again, \"old men\". In town government, our good English word alderman originally carried the sense of \"elder\" or \"patriarch\" or \"head of clan\". Lest we forget, the most important task for a state is survival, and an old person is someone who has managed that, at least.\n\nOld leaders have also been thought useful for reviving old ways, or preserving customs under threat. That's the role Konrad Adenauer - der Alte, \"the old man\" - played in post-war Germany for almost two decades. Already 68 years old when he emerged from a Nazi prison at the end of the second world war, Adenauer became chancellor at 73. \"No experiments!\" was one of his campaign slogans. His shell-shocked voters were grateful for the connection he represented to a Germany that had not known Nazism. So grateful, in fact, that they sent Adenauer to Bonn for three more terms as chancellor. In the early 1960s, when the Beatles were playing their first gigs in Hamburg, Germany was still being ruled by an octogenarian born 13 years before Hitler.\n\nSeniors are, admittedly, often short on vim and aggression, qualities that are indispensable to self-defence. But the hope is that this lack might be compensated by wisdom and a cool head. The inclination to violence that marks many men between adolescence and their early 30s can be an advantage in a martial era. But it isn't always, and whether in wartime or peacetime it should be allowed to subside before a leader takes the control of a nation with an army. Andrew Peabody, a Harvard clergyman and classicist from the age of the 19th-century railroad barons, described aged rulers' role as that of \"brakemen\" on the state's passions.\n\nSlower can be better. Journalists were hard on Ronald Reagan for napping daily (and occasionally even during meetings with dignitaries, most famously with Pope John Paul II in Rome in 1982). But ideally a president should not be sleep-deprived, working overtime, or simply too harried to take a bit of shuteye when he needs it. In his classic account of 19th-century central banking, \"Lombard Street\", Walter Bagehot claimed that we should celebrate - not resent - the unchallenging work by which bankers grow rich. Do you want your banker to be investing your savings in ventures so complicated that he must burn the midnight oil to manage them? Of course not. Such matters are too important. \"The business of banking ought to be simple,\" Bagehot wrote. \"If it is hard it is wrong.\" This is not to say that a lack of vigour is an asset - only that statesmanship conforms better than we usually think to an old man's energy level.\n\nAt the same time, the old are often free agents in a way young people cannot be. Plutarch, who considered envy \"the greatest evil attending the management of public affairs\", approved of old rulers on the grounds that they were less susceptible to it. The old can thus more easily form dynamic alliances. With most of their careers behind them, they are unlikely to be careerists. They can be reckless in the service of truth, at least as they see it - a vital quality in an age of speech codes and self-censorship.\n\nBut there is a darker view of having old people in power, which mirrors a dark view of old people more generally: they have lost touch with their fellow citizens. Joe Biden, for instance, is older than 97% of Americans. This threatens to be especially alienating in a time of rapid social and technological change, because old people tend to adapt poorly. Biden says \"ain't\" and \"y'all\" when he talks to black people, in what he seems to think is a sign of empathy. He addresses America's union workers as if they all still work on assembly lines in automobile plants, whereas today half of unionised workers are in the public sector, and many of those in the private sector are employed by government-adjacent companies: utilities, transport and education.\n\nA novelty of our age is that, since technology creates certain predictable problems (protecting privacy online, climate change, regulating drone traffic), a democracy can be divided into two classes of citizens. There are young ones, who will have to live with the consequences of a problem, and older ones, to whom that problem might be outright invisible. This has not been a failing of Biden's administration, which has designed, and muscled through Congress, vast government programmes meant to establish green-energy infrastructure and restore American competitiveness in microchip manufacturing. But even when it is politically competent, the domination of a country's politics by old people can be evidence of some deeper problem, some uncomfortable sociological reality that is disrupting the usual system of generational succession and blocking the rise of the young.\n\nThe Soviet gerontocracy of the early 1980s, for instance, was fallout from the Stalinist purges of the late 1930s. Brezhnev, Andropov and Chernenko had all, as young men, been among the communist cadres who proved themselves trustworthy - or at least managed to survive at a time when many of their colleagues wound up in the gulag or an early grave. The second world war introduced a crop of heroes whose claims on public loyalty had little to do with the party programme - Marshal Georgi Zhukov conspicuous among them. In most societies a genial soldier like Zhukov would be promoted. In Stalin's, he was considered a rival and marginalised. The pre-war generation circled the wagons, and by 1980, Russia was led by a doddering core born before the first world war. Andropov, the most original among them, decided Mikhail Gorbachev was a trustworthy enough Leninist to be introduced as a voting member of the Politburo, even if he was a raw youth of 49.\n\nThe United States owes its present leadership crisis to a similar generational logjam, albeit one with a different and more benign mechanism. The American baby boom, which lasted from 1946 to 1964, was larger than its European equivalents. By the early 1980s all its members were old enough to vote, and they made up roughly 40% of the country's electorate for decades. This made the baby-boomers politically invincible on any question where the generation had a strong preference. Their whims became laws. In the 1950s, the boomers' parents presided over a huge increase in the country's education budget, which, by the time the youngest boomers graduated, would see university enrolments quintuple.\n\nThe circumstances of the 1960s - in other words, luck - did a great deal to empower the boomers as a generation. They had nothing to do with devising the war in Vietnam, but they were the first to protest against it, and when discontent with the war became a majority sentiment, they wound up vindicated. When Watergate brought the resignation of President Richard Nixon and the landslide Democratic victory in the congressional elections of 1974, half a dozen baby-boomers, still in their 20s, entered Congress. The average age of America's representatives fell below 50 for the first time since the second world war.\n\nAlthough the baby-boomers seemed committed to personal liberation and self-exploration in the 1960s, over time they proved a relatively conservative generation. By the 1980s, they had rallied behind Ronald Reagan and money-making. In the 1990s, they backed the abolition of the tax on inheritances, just in time to collect theirs. These days they back the ruthless protection of full retirement benefits.\n\nAt every step of his career, Joe Biden, born four years before the baby boom began, has been in a position to benefit from demographic change. Just as he is the oldest president in American history, he was in 1972 elected as one of the youngest senators in American history, indeed younger than the constitutionally mandated minimum age of 30. (He was able to take office because his 30th birthday fell in the eight weeks between election day and the Senate's swearing-in.)\n\nHis advantage, and the advantage of politicians like him, has been consolidated by the emergence of an American plutocracy and the role it plays in a money-saturated political system. In the United States, the people who bankroll campaigns do not just want to advance a cause - they want a personal relationship with the politician they're backing. That explains why so much fundraising takes place at fairly intimate dinners.\n\nNow campaign-finance laws make it hard to transfer assets from one candidate to another. That is one reason why, after Biden's debate debacle, the howls of outrage from Democratic-leaning pundits about Biden's unsuitability as a candidate did not immediately bring constructive efforts to replace him. For a trust-fund activist or an oil mogul, an incumbent is an asset whose value must be protected deep into old age. And beyond, if possible: that is why the designation of offspring (such as George W. and Jeb Bush) and wives (such as Hillary Clinton and perhaps, some day, Michelle Obama) as successors has become acceptable, indeed preferable, among political powers-that-be. One can see why monarchy with familial succession is such a deep anthropological norm across societies - it gives those who have rallied behind a ruler the best chance of preserving their privileges.\n\nBaby-boomers made up only 30% of voters in the most recent midterm elections of 2022. Their unceremonious dismissal from the stage of American public life is surely not far away. Yet their power remains entrenched for now. Why might this be?\n\nReplacing leaders gets harder in a time of mass migration and inter-ethnic division. American voters always hesitate to pass the torch to the next generation; they may hesitate even more to pass the torch to a generation that includes newcomers from Latin America and Asia. Democrats are the party of migration and demographic change, trying to win an election at a time when Western voters are suspicious and even hostile to it - consider the recent elections across the European Union. Biden, with his half-century of Washington experience and middle-of-the-road demeanour, allows a dynamic party to reassure swing voters with a familiar face. When Donald Trump described Biden as \"Sleepy Joe\" in 2020, he may have been doing him a favour.\n\nGerontocracies, as noted, often aspire to lock an entire lost political order in place. If we thought of Biden as a gerontocrat, we would see his elevation as an attempt to revive the New Deal culture - a nation of traditional working-father-and-homemaking-mother families earning their livings in factories and on farms - that the party has jettisoned in recent decades, along with the working class that built its lives around it.\n\nBut that is not what is happening now. In the last election Democrats cobbled together a dynamic and fractious alliance of interest groups - single women, gays, government employees, tech entrepreneurs - committed to defeating Donald Trump. They had done this before, in the Obama-era bloc that the journalist Ronald Brownstein called the \"coalition of the ascendant\". But beyond their ascendance, these interest groups still don't have much in common, and in 2020 they had to come together during a summer of protests and riots over race and policing.\n\nAt the time, Biden was not particularly popular among Democratic primary voters. But he provided an image of continuity for a government of discontinuity and promised to reconcile the different wings of his coalition. This reconciliation still proves elusive. Someone who marches for George Floyd might not be committed to arming Ukraine or subsidising green-energy billionaires or keeping abortion legal. The extent of the challenge is visible in its intra-party strife over Israel, as well as the colossal deficits Biden has found it necessary to run up in order to maintain unity. You don't keep a coalition like this together by saying \"no\".\n\nThe problems with Biden are not the traditional problems with gerontocrats - it's not that he's running things like an old man or snoozing through important decisions. It's that the detail-orientation and hyperactivity of his administration leave the impression that he isn't running things at all. Things are being run by some younger people, whom none of us voted for and whose names we perhaps don't even know.\n\nThe American system right now is something very different from a gerontocracy, even if it is being disguised as one. For a country undergoing tremendous stress and change, America is responding with surprising vigour (consider Trump's covid-vaccine programme or Biden's green-energy and tech subsidies) and surprising aggression (consider Biden's eagerness to turn the Russian war against Ukraine into a Western war against Russia).\n\nThat gives something of a logic to the weird face-off between the two candidates. Biden is an old-fashioned person with a progressive and in many ways radical agenda. Trump is delivering promises of a restoration, even if he is not a person who would be deemed worthy of the Oval Office in the America his voters would like him to restore. Whichever side one prefers, there is nothing sleepy or crepuscular about any of it. Immoderation, impetuosity, egotism: the vices of the present day are those not of age but of youth. ■",

The tabloid backed Labour.\n\n-- Rishi Sunak experienced an insane meeting of minds on \"This Morning.\" And revealed his on-brand favorite meal.\n\n**A message from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation: Between 2000 and 2020 Gavi protected one billion children from vaccine-preventable diseases. With the UK's support, we can make our world safer by protecting more children against more diseases, faster than ever before.**\n\nTOP OF THE NEWSLIST\n\nIT'S THE FINAL COUNTDOWN: Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer are preparing to make their final pitches to voters ... with three seat-level polls in the past hour predicting an ever-worsening night for the Conservatives.\n\nFirst data point: The latest YouGov MRP poll dropped in the past few minutes showing an even worse result for the Conservatives than the pollster's previous research a couple of weeks ago. It predicts Labour winning 431 seats with the Tories on 102. That Conservative number is down from 108 in the previous YouGov MRP.\n\nThis is big: That would be a 212 majority for Keir Starmer -- the biggest Commons majority since 1832. The Lib Dems meanwhile are predicted to win 72 seats, the SNP 18 and Reform three.\n\nSecond data point: Another MRP poll for More in Common, in partnership with the News Agents podcast, predicts the Tories will win 126 seats and Labour 430 -- giving the new administration a majority of 210. That sounds like quite good news for the Tories in the current context ... until it's compared with the most recent More in Common MRP from two weeks ago, which predicted Sunak would end up with 155 seats and Labour 406.\n\nThe small print: There are 133 seats in the More in Common poll with majorities of less than 5 percent, meaning a last minute swing could well change the overall picture. And there are 52 seats effectively tied, including those of Conservative leadership hopeful Penny Mordaunt against Labour in Portsmouth North and Labour frontbencher Thangam Debbonaire against the Greens in Bristol Central.\n\nExtras: The Lib Dems are set to win more than 50 seats, More in Common reckons, while the SNP is set to fall below 20. The pollster also predicts former Labour boss Jeremy Corbyn will win his Islington North seat, while Nigel Farage and Lee Anderson are set to win their respective Clacton and Ashfield targets for Reform. Full map here.\n\nThird data point: The Conservatives have dropped a further two seats since last week in the latest MRP for Focaldata, also released this afternoon. The poll puts the Labour on 444 seats (down six on last week) and the Tories on 108, meaning a 238 majority for Starmer and co. The Lib Dems are the main beneficiaries of the shifting sands, up seven seats on 57, while the Reform has doubled its expectations in a week ... to two seats.\n\nAnd there's more: There have been a whole bunch of voting intention polls in the past few hours too (those boring old normal polls we used to get excited about before the MRP bubble came along) predicting nothing less than a 17-point Labour lead.\n\nOnwards to (not) victory! Sunak will nevertheless keep his duracell rabbit vibe going to the bitter end, hosting a rally at 8 p.m. tonight in Hampshire. Expect warnings about tax rises, supermajorities, increased legal and illegal migration and all the other things that are horrible when it's not the Tories doing them.\n\nSupermajorities latest: Minister for the broadcast studios Mel Stride told Times Radio this morning Britain looks to be on the brink of \"the largest landslide we will have ever seen,\" urging voters to consider \"supporting the Conservative Party so we can hold this government to account going forward.\" Quite the line less than 24 hours before polls open.\n\nMixed messages: Appearing on \"This Morning,\" erm, this morning, Sunak said Stride wasn't conceding defeat. The PM insisted he was \"fighting hard for every vote\" and that a few more ballots in the right places \"can make the difference in this election.\" Easier said than done.\n\nStill not giving up, honest: And in an interview with PA which landed in the last few minutes, the PM said he wasn't willing to reflect on his time in office while the election was ongoing. \"As long as I can look myself in the mirror and know that I am working as hard as I can, doing what I believe is right for the country, that is how I get through,\" he said.\n\nDon't believe the hype: Speaking to broadcasters during a campain event in Wales, Starmer said the Stride line was an effort in \"voter suppression,\" adding : \"It's trying to get people to stay at home rather than go out and vote.\" He said something or other about people who want change needing to vote for it.\n\nNot bovverd: Starmer also told hacks Boris Johnson materializing on the campaign trail like a mirage in the dessert last night wasn't a concern. \"Having argued for six weeks that they're chaotic and divided, to bring out exhibit A, with 24 hours to go, just vindicated the argument I've been making,\" he said. Steven Swinford has the behind-the-scenes on how Sunak talked BoJo into a campaign appearance.\n\nNot to mention: Playbook PM remembers when BoJo was opening for all the final stump speeches Theresa May did in the 2017 election. And we all know how that ended. Even BoJo's dad ain't following his advice.\n\nLast Starmer stump: The Labour leader is expected to appear at a rally in Worcestershire at around 8 p.m. too.\n\nMaking platforms for Nigel: Reform boss Nigel Farage will be doing his Donald Trump impressions at Clacton Pier from 6 p.m. for his last hurrah of the campaign. He's done his final campaign interview with Chris Hope of GB News (who else?) which should appear on the broadcaster around 7 p.m. Farage faced further accusations of hanging out with wrong 'uns this afternoon.\n\nOn the Ed one last time: Lib Dem boss Ed Davey has been in Hertfordshire with his second-in-command Daisy Cooper. He drove a tractor earlier with \"he who dares wins\" printed on it -- the line Michael Gove is said to have delivered to Cabinet when Rishi Sunak called the election. There's no doubt Davey has proved he has more daring balls than Gove during this campaign. Not least because Gove didn't even dare stand.\n\nBack to the polls: While readers wait for those final campaign pitches, there has been shed loads more polling out since this morning, which is as good a form of entertainment as any -- including various interesting side-insights exclusive to Playbook PM.\n\nConservative Hail Mary pass: A good chunk of undecided voters could return to the Tories in vital seats, making the difference between election defeat and total wipeout, per new research by JL Partners shared with Playbook PM. Nine percent of voters in safe-ish Conservative seats are still undecided (slightly higher than in seats overall) and almost two-thirds of these undecideds voted Conservative in 2019.\n\nCold comfort: There are signs these late deciders are not yet ready to switch allegiance. Rishi Sunak's approval rating is at net -5 among this group and has improved over the campaign, compared with a score of -34 for Keir Starmer. Promising stuff for the Tories.\n\nHowever: Another More in Common poll for the New Britain Project think tank and shared with Playbook PM showed Labour ahead of the Tories (and Reform) on various crucial metrics, such as having a long-term vision for Britain, competence, fixing problems, being stable and being good in a crisis.\n\nAnd to make matters even worse ... more than a quarter of voters are planning to cast their ballot tactically, acording to research from Savanta for the Electoral Reform Society and shared with Playbook PM. That's up three points since the questin was asked at the start of the campaign. But (and this is quite the but) it's lower than at the same point before the 2019 election, when intention to vote tactically was at 30 percent. Would it be a huge surprise if all the noise about tactical voting comes to nothing again?\n\nStill want more polling? More in Common boss Luke Tryl will be discussing his latest MRP data with UCL in a 6 p.m. webinar. Details here.\n\nPolling product warning: It's well worth reading this thread from Savanta's Chris Hopkins, which does lots of important expectation management and tries to un-spin the inevitable spin from the parties once the actual results become clear.\n\nDRIVETIME DEBRIEF\n\nIT HAPPENED: The Sun backed Labour! The right-wing tabloid was never gonna be on the losing side, right? Its leader article for tomorrow says the Tories are \"exhausted\" after endless chaos.

She told the Telegraph she agreed with Sunak that sandwiches are the best meal. \"I'm totally with him on sandwiches being the best,\" she told the paper. \"My favorite is bacon, lettuce and tomato.\" She added: \"Rishi Sunak was gorgeous, he had beautiful skin, lovely eyes and teeth -- I'd love to give him a good sandwich.\" No prizes for guessing what she'd like to do with his beautiful skin.\n\nAnd there's more: \"I'm not into politics whatsoever. I know I should care, but I don't,\" Holt said, speaking for most of Britain. \"I like the memes but other than that I have no interest.\"\n\nSeriously, this stuff keeps coming: Asked which party leader she would get tattooed on her body, she said she would get Sunak. \"I'd get a picture of his face and put a little caption saying 'when I was little I didn't get Sky TV,'\" she said.

Even traditionally Conservative supporters, like Boris Johnson's father and the Sun newspaper, are backing Labour. Sunak remains determined, hosting a rally in Hampshire, while Starmer campaigns in Worcestershire. The election's outcome could reshape British politics, with implications for party leadership and future governance."

        "body": "The lack of underground shelter space for protection during a nuclear conflict is prompting people to invest in private bunkers.\n\nThe \"scare factor\" from potential nuclear fallout, especially with the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, is a major reason why individuals are preparing for the worst, according to Charles Hardman, who runs the company Subterranean Spaces.\n\nSome of his clients include energy company directors, Middle Eastern royalty, and European car company owners.\n\nHe said that fear of nuclear conflict, especially due to the recent Russia-Ukraine war was a major reason for bunker purchases, though a desire to showcase wealth also played a role.\n\nHe said that very wealthy people wanted \"to tick the box\" with a Ferrari, an Aston Martin, a house in Europe, and a house in the UK.\n\nBut now, a nuclear bunker is \"something they can tick the box with,\" he said.\n\nMr. Hardman, who also has quite a lot of inquiries overseas, in Europe and Saudi Arabia, said that demand had \"plateaued\" in England, in part due to the fact that news coverage of the Ukraine war has dropped.\n\n\"The only reason people call up is if they get worried,\" he said.\n\n\"It's the wrong time; it's too late then. These things take eight to ten months to a year to build. People should be preparing now. The whole of Europe is getting them done,\" he added, citing Sweden, Switzerland, and Germany as examples.\n\nThough he warned that in the UK there's no preparation. \"There's nothing,\" he said.\n\n\"Israel has to have a safe room for every property. China and Russia have built vast bunkers for their populations, and yet, in the UK, they're like, 'No, we don't need bunkers,'\" he said.\n\nMr. Thompson's company fills a niche by building smaller, more affordable bunkers, ranging from £20,000 to £150,000.\n\n\"You tend to have people who build bunkers for billionaires and millionaires, some of these are extremely lavish, with cinemas and swimming pools. But that's not what the everyday person can afford,\" he said.\n\nThough he said that the growing interest due to increased awareness of potential conflicts.\n\n\"More and more people are waking up to the fact that we are basically marching towards World War Three between NATO and Russia,\" he said.\n\nNuclear war followed by climate change were people's biggest concerns.\n\n\"We had them in World War Two, Anderson shelters, of course, they made a couple of million, but they did save millions of lives,\" he said.\n\nHowever he explained that the difference between now and then is that the humble World War II Anderson shelter was designed to offer British householders an afternoon of protection during bomb raids.\n\nBut in a fallout shelter, where you must hide from potential radiation, people may need to stay for two weeks or longer. Therefore, it has to be comfortable to live in, with sleeping quarters, cooking facilities, washing and bathing amenities, and entertainment and games etc.\n\n\"We had fallout from Chernobyl land in Wales, and we still have to scan the sheep today for radiation,\" he said.\n\nMr. Thompson's wife, a trained psychologist, provides video content to help people cope during crises in a potential bunker situation.\n\nHe said that planning permission is growing and depends on \"what area you live in and who you are.\" However, some clients may wish to remain tight-lipped about such a project.\n\n\"Do you want to advertise your bunker? Because when it all goes wrong, they are going to be in your bunker -- and if you've only built one for your family you can't support half the neighbourhood,\" he said.",

        "title": "The dragnet approach to the EU individual sanctions regime is failing",
        "body": "Dr Moshe Kantor's case clearly demonstrates a cleanup of the list is long overdue. Those who deserve sanctions should remain, while those who were caught up in the overly tenacious initial compilation should be removed, Eldad Beck writes.\n\nSince the very beginning of the Russia-Ukraine war in February 2022, the European Union has taken many measures and posed sanctions against Russia and those deemed to be \"supporting, financing or implementing actions\" in the war effort.\n\nUnfortunately, in a hurried approach, some of the bureaucrats who put together the list and the criteria for applying personal sanctions against hundreds of individuals took what now appears to be a scorched earth policy. On many occasions, they seemingly relied on simple Google searches and Russia's rich list, much of which would not have stood up in court.\n\nIn fact, in April, this was proven true.\n\nTwo individuals, Mikhail Fridman and Petr Aven, successfully proved before the European Court of Justice that the European Council had not presented enough evidence to establish that they met the necessary bar of being involved in efforts that \"undermine or threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine\".\n\nNow, another hearing on one of the most egregious cases to date could deal another blow to the sanctions regime.\n\nOn 19 June, the General Court, the Court of Justice of the European Union, held a hearing on the case of Dr Moshe Kantor, former President of the European Jewish Congress (EJC), who stepped back from his position following the Council's decision to include him on the list of individual sanctions in 2022.\n\nKantor is the only democratically elected leader of a European minority community who was included on the individual sanctions list. In his role as a Jewish leader, he met with many European heads of state, European decision-makers and opinion-shapers.\n\nFor his activities, the promotion of tolerance and fighting against xenophobia and antisemitism, Dr Kantor received, over the years, state honours from, amongst others, Poland, Ukraine, Italy, Romania, Belgium, Austria and France.\n\nIronically, French President Emmanuel Macron awarded Kantor with the title of Commandeur de la Légion d'Honneur only a few weeks before France voted, as a member of the EU Council, to sanction him because of Kantor's presumed economic ties with the Kremlin.\n\nDuring the hearing at the EU Court, Kantor's defence team stressed that the whole process against Kantor was born in sin and haste and created an \"exceptional situation\", in which Kantor is sanctioned despite the fact that he has been living for decades away from Russia, has dedicated his life for the fight against antisemitism, promoting tolerance and ensuring the security of Jewish communities in Europe.\n\nMoreover, insisted the defence, the sanctions were renewed time and time again since September 2022 with an \"incomprehensible insistence\" despite all evidence provided to the Council, showing that Kantor ceased all his business activities even before the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014.\n\nAfter the EU Council legal team made its case, clearly exasperated, one of the judges asked again for evidence for the \"mechanisms of benefit\" between Kantor and Russian President Vladimir Putin, a crucial element in the case for sanctions. The Council's lawyers responded that all the evidence had previously been presented and were unable or unwilling to add anything new.\n\nTo demonstrate another problematic part of the accusations against him, Kantor's legal team brought up the fact that the first official file against him stated that he had \"Jewish-Russian\" nationality, a highly problematic and discriminatory appellation used by the Nazis against Jews in the 20th century.\n\nKantor was the only person on the EU sanctions list whose religious affiliation was referred to. This \"mistake\" brought the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, to apologise to Kantor.\n\nA letter signed by Michel0s Head of Cabinet, Frederic Bernard, dated 27 July 2022, explains: \"We sincerely regret the error that has been made by the responsible service with regards to your nationality in the evidence pack and has been rectified. The correct version of the document is enclosed herewith.\"\n\nWhile this was the most controversial, it was not the only error in the case against Kantor.\n\nAccording to numerous articles and experts who have assessed the working files of some of those sanctioned, the evidence compiled was \"slipshod\", \"shaky\" and \"embarrassing\".\n\nThe document used as a basis to sanction Kantor in 2022 contains only 64 pages and includes just eight articles and websites, six of which are machine-translated versions of Russian-language originals. The bulk of the packet consists of screenshots of entire articles, with relevant passages highlighted in yellow.\n\nTwo of the articles, on the Russian web portal Rambler and outlet Vecherniy Murmansk, are labeled on the websites as an \"advertisement\" or \"paid advertisement\", a description that was not included in the evidence packet. It is unknown who paid for these advertisements.\n\nSome of these articles are what can only be described as \"fake news\" pieces, which antisemitically accused Kantor of using his position as a Jewish leader to distort the memory of the Holocaust and minimise antisemitism for personal gain.\n\nAccepting these types of articles at face value, knowing they are paid advertisements on sometimes obscure websites by unknown figures, can themselves be construed as antisemitic.\n\nThe file also mistakenly lists Kantor as a shareholder of Acron, a Russian-based mineral fertiliser producer, instead of as an ultimate beneficiary.\n\nOn the point of Kantor's relationship with Putin, he has not held any business position in Russia for 30 years and has devoted all of his time and efforts to leading the European Jewish community over the last 20 years. No other person on the list is comparable to him in these respects. All the other people listed as \"businesspersons\" have either business positions or capital holdings in Russia.\n\nThe Court has even annulled the Council's decision to retain a businessperson on the sanctions list who left his position a few months before the renewal, as was the case for Alexander Shulgin last September.\n\nAs Kantor's legal team made clear, contrary to many other individuals on the sanctions list, Kantor was never invited to the numerous business forum meetings organised by the Kremlin for leading businessmen in Russia.\n\nIn the hearing, Kantor's legal team asserted that the Council's supposed case is simply based on the idea that one cannot be wealthy and of Russian origin without being a \"leading\" businessperson involved in a sector providing a substantial source of revenue to Russia.\n\nKantor's lawyers spoke about a \"real blindness\" of the Council in front of facts and of \"impossible scenarios,\" accusing Kantor of minimising the dimension of antisemitism in Russia or disproportionally promoting Russia´s role during WWII for personal gains\n\nThe EU Council's legal team admitted several times that mistakes were made in the preparation of Kantor´s sanctions file regarding his nationality and the claim that he was a shareholder of the Acron group.\n\nThe question that requires answering is why Kantor was sanctioned in the first place and remains on the list.\n\nSome have argued that his tireless campaigns for the security of Jewish communities, against antisemitism, as well as fighting Holocaust distortion and denial over the last 20 years, have fueled resentment against Kantor, and some old and baseless allegations against him are now weaponised.\n\nThe jurist Regis Bismuth, professor at the Sciences Po Law School in Paris and Director of Studies of the French Branch of International Law Association (ILA) and an expert on EU sanctions sees a structural failure in the way the sanctions list was prepared, and in the case of Kantor in particular.\n\n\"I think that it is interesting to place this case in the larger background of how sanctions are adopted by the EU Council. In 2022, hundreds of people were listed on the EU restriction measures list. Of course, some of them are deeply connected with the Russian regime, but not all of them,\" Professor Bismuth said.\n\n\"The files on the first group of sanctioned individuals were completed in just a few days. We do not have information on how files justifying individual sanctions were made. We have to keep in mind that many people were put on the list very quickly and often on the basis of information gathered from newspapers, sometimes Russian publications that are not completely reliable, or from social media.\"\n\n\"With Dr Kantor, there is a clear manifest error of assessment. What is particularly shocking about the case of Dr Kantor is that the file is relatively empty, and he appears to have been listed on the basis of his alleged wealth\".\n\nRegardless of the motivations for placing and maintaining Kantor on the sanctions list, the public hearing at the General Court laid bare many problems of the individual sanctions regime.\n\nThat is why a cleanup of the list is long overdue. Those who deserve sanctions should remain, while those who were caught up in the overly tenacious initial compilation should be removed.\n\nThe EU sanctions regime has suffered some recent blows. Disassociating itself from those who clearly have no place on the list would be a good start in its reputational restoration.\n\nEldad Beck is an Israeli journalist.",

Since the Russia-Ukraine war began in February 2022, the EU imposed sanctions on many individuals, but the process was rushed and often relied on unreliable sources. Dr. Moshe Kantor, a prominent Jewish leader and former President of the European Jewish Congress, was sanctioned due to presumed economic ties with the Kremlin, despite his long-standing efforts against antisemitism and his lack of business activities in Russia for decades.\n\nIn June 2023, the General Court of the European Union held a hearing on Kantor's case, where his defense argued that the sanctions were based on erroneous and discriminatory information. The EU Council's legal team admitted to several mistakes in Kantor's file. The case underscores broader issues with the EU's sanctions list, which was hastily compiled and included individuals based on flimsy evidence. The article calls for a thorough review and cleanup of the sanctions list to restore the regime's credibility."

Russia will face increasing difficulties in its defense production, especially its production of armored vehicles. You'll see increasing U.S. and European production coming online. You'll see the introduction of F-16s, which will at least give Ukraine some additional flexibility. Ukraine's strategy through 2024 is going to be to play defense, and hopefully that puts them on a footing for a possible offensive in 2025.\n\nThere are people in Washington who say we can't keep supporting Ukraine because it undermines our ability to prepare for China. But if we're looking at a potential future conflict with China, there are two worlds we could fight it in.\n\nOne is a world in which Ukraine loses. In that world, all of our European allies are going to be laser-focused on protecting themselves from the next attack from Russia. The United States will be more diplomatically isolated, because those 31 NATO allies are going to be much more concerned about their own security than about helping the United States in a fight against China.\n\nThe other world is one in which Ukraine wins. Then you have a Ukraine that is going to be the largest and most capable army in Europe acting as a bulwark against Russian aggression. That gives you a strong European flank to the United States' east. You have countries that are confident not only in their own security but in the collective capability of NATO to deter and defeat aggression. They are going to be more willing to contribute if the U.S. finds itself in a war in the Indo-Pacific. This idea that somehow helping Ukraine leaves us less prepared for a war in China is just seeing the world as flat when it's not.\n\nIt needs to either bring them in or make it clear they're not going to be a member. Leaving them in diplomatic limbo just makes things worse for Ukraine and undermines NATO. Personally, I think Ukraine must become a member, but a bigger question right now is, What does NATO need to do to ensure Ukraine wins this war?\n\nA victorious, unified Ukraine would be the most capable military in Europe, and at that point it would just be foolish not to bring them in.\n\nIncrease its defense industrial base. As long as Russia sees that it's outproducing the combined capabilities of the United States and its European allies in NATO, it will see that it can continue to fight this war. As soon as the United States and Europe match those numbers, the calculus changes.\n\nI'd also like to see NATO air defenses providing a shield over western Ukraine. You've seen Russia fire missiles and attack drones that actually overfly NATO territory. And rather than air defenses from those nations firing at them and shooting them down, they've relied on Ukraine to use its air defenses to do that. The idea that you wouldn't protect NATO skies by engaging those missiles and drones -- it's not only not helping Ukraine, but it's undermining NATO's Article 5 deterrence. I'd also support France's proposal to start bringing troops into western Ukraine, far from the front lines, to provide training on the ground to Ukrainians.\n\nThe same way they've responded so far, which is with a lot of nuclear bluster. They know as soon as they mention tactical nuclear weapons, it will freeze decisionmakers in some capitals.\n\nWe're seeing an increase in threats below the level of military action -- massive amounts of disinformation, illicit finances being used to undermine political processes. NATO has been so successful over the past 75 years that its enemies are trying to use other ways to attack or undermine the alliance. It's going to struggle to define what constitutes an attack, and then to ensure it has the capabilities it needs to respond. You've seen China and Russia engage in these threats below the level of what you would consider conventional military actions. NATO needs to make itself a harder target by developing more capabilities that are below the threshold of direct military confrontation and demonstrating a willingness to use them. But it needs to do that while also upholding the democratic ideas of freedom and openness.\n\nI had considered joining at several points in my life. Then, in 2015, I was the senior adviser on Russia strategy, and I'd participate in these wargames, where Russia was attacking NATO. I was always advocating for more NATO forces forward and, in particular, more U.S. forces. We also consistently found that the U.S. Army had not nearly enough large-scale engineering capabilities. My mom used to always say, 'If you want something done right, then do it yourself.' I decided to join as an Army engineer, not just because I thought it was important for me personally. I was advocating moving forward U.S. military forces, essentially as a tripwire, and I wasn't comfortable doing that if I wasn't willing to put myself in that position.\n\nOne thing the Army has taught me is how the military approaches risk. It doesn't get to decide which missions to pursue. It just has to look at how to assess and mitigate risk, with the understanding that it will always have to accept a certain level of risk to complete the mission. That's something military leaders understand very well, but it's not necessarily deeply engrained in civilian culture. It's also helped me think more broadly about defense and security problems -- not just looking at things and platforms, but at people and leadership.\n\nI was a big Detroit Red Wings fan when I was a kid. Hockey fans might remember, back in the '90s, the Russian Five. It was this line of five Russian players who were brought to the Red Wings and ended up winning several Stanley Cups. Growing up, I would watch Tom Clancy films with my dad, where the Russians were always the bad guys; and then I would watch the Detroit Red Wings, where the Russians were the good guys. It caused this cognitive dissonance in my mind, this contradiction that I wanted to study more. So I pursued Russian studies and international relations in college, and I guess the rest is history.",

The decision to withhold military aid risks not only undermining solidarity but also signalling weakness that could embolden further aggression and escalate conflicts into neighbouring regions.\n\nWestern nations must understand the prolonged nature of the standoff with Russia. Doubts about Russia's future must be dispelled, and fears of its potential dissolution should not dictate policy. The current state of Russia, maintaining a quasi-imperial stance, poses significant threats to global security, including the uncontrolled proliferation of missile and nuclear technologies among adversarial states.\n\nFailure to support Eastern European democracies sends a clear message globally that the era of Western dominance in global affairs is waning. This reluctance could potentially lead to a new era of instability characterised by localised conflicts and the ominous spectre of a major global war, possibly involving nuclear weapons.\n\nThe current ceasefire in Ukraine may prove to be a precursor to potential broader global conflicts. Observers note with concern the West's apparent reluctance or inability to address global challenges. This hesitance emboldens proponents of global realignment, who are increasingly stirring conflicts in the Middle East, East and South Asia, and the Persian Gulf. Russia's actions in Ukraine serve as a catalyst, encouraging proxies worldwide to challenge the existing global order.\n\nThe West is currently being tested on its ability to confront contemporary challenges decisively. Failure to do so could lead to scenarios where critical international corridors, such as the Suwalki Corridor, will fall under threat, or where aggression against Baltic states becomes a reality.\n\nRussian society's deep-seated resentment and nostalgia for its former imperial status exacerbate global tensions. Western democracies must acknowledge their historical responsibilities and the immense international pressures they will face should they fail to adequately support Ukraine with the necessary military aid.\n\nReduced aid to Ukraine not only places the United States and other Western nations under international scrutiny but also shifts the burden of historical responsibility onto them for potentially exacerbating a global crisis.\n\nIt is crucial for NATO to maintain comprehensive support particularly through military aid to Ukraine. The economic and strategic costs of countering Russian ambitions in Ukraine far outweigh the costs of preventive measures.\n\nIt is not solely Ukraine's struggle; the democratic free world must adopt a resolute stance against the current regime in Moscow. This includes setting clear conditions for ending the conflict, maximising Ukraine's military capabilities, and diplomatically isolating Russia to prevent future aggression.\n\nTimely provision of arms and ammunition to Ukraine is critical to avoid scenarios where NATO must invoke Article 5 of its Treaty as a last resort.\n\nThe West faces a critical juncture where its decisions will resonate globally. By unequivocally supporting Ukraine with military aid it needs, the West can demonstrate its commitment to international stability and reaffirm its leadership in an increasingly tumultuous world. The consequences of indecision or half-hearted support would be catastrophic, spawning a dangerous new global order that would threaten peace and security worldwide.",

        "title": "The Future of NATO",
        "body": "To mark NATO's 75th Anniversary summit in Washington, D.C., the Quincy Institute invited leading U.S. and European analysts to comment on the future of the alliance. While differing greatly in their assessment both of NATO's role to date and of how they would like to see it develop in the future, all agree that NATO is facing an exceptionally difficult and dangerous period in its history.\n\nNATO likes to describe itself as \"the most successful alliance in history\" not because it won a war, but because during the Cold War it deterred a Soviet attack on Western Europe and thereby prevented a new world war. What is too often forgotten, however, is that war was prevented not just by NATO solidarity, but also by NATO caution. Successive U.S. administrations -- fully backed by their European allies -- rejected calls for aggressive policies aimed at \"rolling back\" Soviet power in Eastern Europe.\n\nSince the end of the Cold War, by contrast, NATO has become committed to rolling back Russian power even in former Soviet countries on Russia's own borders. As a result of the clash between this and Moscow's determination to maintain a sphere of influence, NATO now finds itself in a proxy conflict with Moscow on the European Continent itself. If this turns into direct war, there is a good chance that it will end with a nuclear exchange. At that point, the question of the future role of NATO will become meaningless, if only because there will be nobody left to ask it.\n\nIf direct war can be avoided, most analysts predict that mutual hostility between Russia and the West will continue for the foreseeable future, and will involve the risk of further clashes around Russia's borders -- for example, over the future of Belarus and Russian access to the exclave of Kaliningrad across NATO territory in Lithuania. How great this threat will be depends on how the war in Ukraine eventually ends, and whether it is through a compromise peace or a petering out into an endless semifrozen conflict.\n\nAnalysts agree that NATO's European members will definitely try to rearm, especially if Donald Trump is reelected and U.S. commitment to Europe seems uncertain. Their efforts in this direction will, however, be hampered by economic stagnation, the conflicting demands of increasingly endangered budgets for health and social welfare, and the resistance of European countries to pooling their military production. In an effort to please Washington and ensure that the U.S. maintains its military presence in Europe, NATO is also likely to make public gestures toward a global role and the containment of China.\n\nIf the U.S. does pull back from Europe to any significant extent, NATO is likely to abandon its expansionist program of recent decades and limit itself to the defense of its existing members. This shift would, however, lead to considerable tensions between NATO members over policy toward Russia.\n\nOne notable result of the war in Ukraine has been the almost complete disappearance from NATO discussions of the threat of climate change, previously described as \"existential.\" Nor does NATO have any strategy for the stabilization of countries to its south, or for addressing illegal migration across the Mediterranean. A few decades from now, however, the growth of these dangers may render many of NATO's existing preoccupations irrelevant.\n\n- Anatol Lieven, Eurasia Program Director, Quincy Institute\n\nSince the end of the Cold War, NATO has gone through many incarnations: NATO, the agent of transformation to bring Eastern Europe into the league of Western democracies. NATO, the fighter in the war against terrorism. NATO, the cybersleuth. The democracy-builder. The rules-based order enforcer.\n\nAnd finally, at its 75 anniversary, NATO seems to be going back to its original mission: a collective defense pact to keep Europe safe -- and Russia out.\n\nIt is not surprising that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has energized the organization and reaffirmed the importance of Article 5 to all member states, big or small. NATO is no longer \"brain-dead\" and certainly has the capacity to deter Russia from attacking its member states.\n\nBut there still is much to do for the alliance to retain its relevance into the future.\n\nThe first is creation of benchmarks and incentives for members to do more for their own defense, so Europe can reduce its reliance on the United States as its sole security guarantor. No matter who gets to the White House in November, American public sentiment is shifting in ways that are certain to have long-term implications for U.S. commitment to European security.\n\nAt a time when Washington views China and the Indo-Pacific as the foremost strategic challenge, Europeans need to develop industrial capabilities so as to have the freedom to make independent decisions for their own destiny. That inevitably means increasing military spending and manufacturing to complement the U.S. role in European security today and develop more autonomous reflexes tomorrow.\n\nNATO also needs to have a clear-eyed view of what its endgame in Ukraine is. Despite the slogan \"Ukraine's defense is Europe's defense,\" Ukraine's Western backers do not have a unified vision for where Ukraine fits in Europe's security. While supporting Ukraine's ability to defend itself against Russian aggression has been critical for the alliance, given that Russia is far from losing the war, it's time to start thinking of how this war ends -- in ways that preserve Ukraine's sovereignty and build a new security architecture for Europe.\n\nUkraine's theory of victory is increasingly looking unachievable to its Western backers. It's not hard to imagine negotiations for a ceasefire -- even with continued Russian occupation in parts of Ukraine -- at some point over the next few years. The U.S. and its allies need to be able to provide sufficient security guarantees for Ukraine, so its leaders and society have the confidence to accept a bitter peace -- and embark toward a more desirable future.\n\nThat means a smaller but stronger Ukraine -- and NATO can be a critical piece of that.\n\nWhat role NATO plays in negotiations to end the war will define the future of the alliance -- and the nature of strategic stability with a nuclear Russia. If NATO can play some role in the creation of a postconflict Ukraine, even in the absence of full membership for Ukraine, it will remain relevant in Europe's future security architecture.\n\nOf course, none of this might happen. Europe may remain divided on the question of strategic autonomy, with many member states following the U.S. lead on geopolitical challenges. There may not be consensus inside the alliance for an active role for an endgame in Ukraine -- leaving the matter entirely to Washington. America's strategic involvement with the Indo-Pacific might make individual member states more eager to strike bilateral arrangements with Washington -- hollowing out NATO's core mission or creating an internal constituency that wants to steer the alliance more toward greater competition with China.\n\nThat, I am afraid, would mean that NATO's perpetual search for a mission will continue into its fourth quarter-century and well into the next generation.\n\nAsli Aydintasbas is a Visiting Fellow at the Brookings Institution's foreign policy program and a Senior Associate Fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.'\n\nIn the European theater, conventional deterrence and defense should be ensured by Europeans. The 300,000 troops in a high state of readiness that the NATO New Force Model envisages on the eastern flank should be European troops. And they should need but a single American to be fully operational: SACEUR.\n\nAs it is, however, those 300,000 troops will still be dependent on American strategic enablers: intelligence, transport, deep strike, etc. Therefore, the European allies should go beyond the capability targets that NATO has currently assigned to them, and acquire all the necessary enablers themselves. That will undoubtedly require a collective effort, such as German Chancellor Scholz's Sky Shield initiative for a unified European air defense system.\n\nThat is where the European Union can help. Not in trying to align capability development and defense planning of its member states under the E.U. flag. After exactly 25 years (the Common Security and Defence Policy was launched in 1999), it is clear that nations do not want this. But the E.U. does have instruments that work, or can work: the European Defence Fund to invest in research and industry and the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) to build modular multinational capabilities. Those should be put to use to help the European allies build a comprehensive, full-spectrum force package within NATO.\n\nIf the Europeans managed to achieve this, this force package would constitute a tangible European pillar of NATO, in terms of capabilities. The U.S. should fully support such a move, and refrain from irritating allies by seeing everything in terms of defense industrial interests. If Europeans spend more money, of course they will want to spend more (not all) of that on European equipment. Washington needs Europe to do more, for it will free up conventional military resources for its own priorities in Asia, while the American nuclear umbrella remains the ultimate guarantee.\n\nIndeed, it is precisely because President Obama in 2012 already made Asia into the U.S.' No. 1 priority that Europeans must build a complete pillar within NATO. Twelve years later, it is about time the European allies stop convincing themselves that whatever happens, the U.S. cavalry will always be there. The reality is that in case of simultaneous wars in Europe and Asia, the U.S. is likely to prioritize the latter. Moreover, E.U. member states can only confidently support E.U. candidate country Ukraine (and Moldova and Georgia) without having to fear direct Russian retaliation, because NATO provides deterrence -- the conventional part of which Europeans must in the end ensure themselves.\n\nAn alliance that rests both on the U.S. and on an autonomous European pillar would be a much more balanced, and therefore more healthy alliance. But the Europeans should also build this pillar to prepare for less-healthy scenarios. If domestic politics lead the U.S. to reduce its commitment to NATO, the Europeans should be ready to seamlessly take over any task that the U.S. might withdraw from. Strategy is all about being prepared to uphold your interests, whatever comes to pass.\n\nProf. Sven Biscop is the Director of the Europe in the World program at Egmont -- The Royal Institute for International Relations in Brussels. He also lectures at Ghent University.\n\nAs with so much else, NATO's future will ultimately depend on the future America chooses for itself. American policymakers would do well to reconsider the wisdom of continuing the 80-year American military presence in Europe. One alternative would be to pursue a \"less-than-grand\" strategy of American engagement that focuses primarily on a regional security arrangement between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada in anticipation of China's rise. If the U.S. is unlikely to ever fully exit the North Atlantic alliance, it might, at a minimum, step aside from NATO's integrated military command, in the manner of Charles de Gaulle in 1966.\n\nGiven that it inhabits an entirely different part of the planet, Europe will naturally confront a set of different challenges from those facing the U.S. The most pressing, if various models are to be believed, will be the challenge posed by mass migration.\n\nFor Europe to have a happy future, it must tend to its own garden, and this necessitates a strategy of containing and mitigating the effects of climate migration. The strategy could be twofold: First, E.U. member states might set up a kind of climate mitigation fund for sub-Saharan Africa, which, in turn, would be coupled with a robust interdiction strategy against illegal migration in the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean.\n\nNATO, as currently conceived by transatlantic elites, is a danger to regional, and indeed, global stability: no NATO expansion, no war in Georgia in 2008; no NATO expansion, no war in Ukraine in 2022. Meanwhile, NATO's 2011 intervention in Libya resulted in the destruction of the Libyan state and mass migration flows across the Mediterranean.\n\nSen. Richard Lugar's indelible phrase, \"Out of area or out of business,\" implied that to survive, NATO had to go hunting for work outside of its borders -- and in the three decades that followed Lugar's recommendation, it did. But it turns out that there is plenty of \"in-area\" work for NATO to do -- only contrary to what transatlantic elites constantly tell us, that work doesn't have to do with the Russians. The threat to Europe's future will not come from its east, it will come from its south -- and the challenge will not be a military one. It will be humanitarian.\n\nTo successfully deal with this, NATO should adopt a medium- to long-term strategy of targeted devolution -- its primary focus would be to defend Europe's borders -- and therefore its prosperity, its identity, and its security. The idea that NATO now has to go further and further \"out of area\" to the Indo-Pacific, is deeply misconceived -- instead, in the coming decades NATO should transform itself into a pan-European coast guard and border patrol -- perhaps in some combination with the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) and the European Gendarmerie Force.\n\nIn the end, if NATO is to actually serve a useful role in securing Europe's future, it needs to abandon its pretensions of being a \"global policeman\" and become, instead, a cop on the beat.\n\nJames Carden is a contributing writer for foreign affairs at The Nation. He served as a policy advisor to the Special Representative for Intergovernmental Affairs and the Office of Russia Affairs at the US State Department.\n\nOver the next generation, the NATO alliance should be prudent about both development and change. Historically, the alliance has excelled at being what it formally is: a defensive military alliance. The alliance had been created to deter the Soviet Union, which it did for the duration of the Cold War. Now its task is to deter Russia. Although Russia's invasion of Ukraine has destabilized Russia's relations with the West, NATO territory has not been attacked, and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of NATO member states has not been challenged by Russia. NATO's most important responsibility is to ensure that this remains the case.\n\nNATO's self-definition as a defensive military alliance does not mean it can or should turn inward. Tensions between Russia on the one hand and Europe and the United States on the other are going to remain high for years, if not for decades. Even if NATO is unable to incorporate new states into the alliance -- Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus, or states in the Balkans and in the South Caucasus -- NATO should be conceptualized as the inner circle of a two-layered strategy designed to contain the spread of Russian military power.\n\nNATO should not be directly involved in the war in Ukraine or in subsidiary wars that flow out from Russia's invasion of Ukraine (in Moldova, say, or in Georgia). Yet NATO members should be deeply committed to ensuring Ukraine's security. Were Russia to conquer Ukraine, NATO's deterrent work would be rendered vastly more difficult. Were the Kremlin to see its war in Ukraine as a dead end, Russia would be easier to deter throughout Europe. In this way does Ukraine's security reflect the overall health of the NATO alliance.\n\nNATO runs two separate risks in its possible course of development and change. These risks can be characterized as overreach and underreach.\n\nOverreach would entail the blurring of lines in the existing struggle between NATO and Russia. If the alliance is not disciplined, it could allow several things to happen: direct forms of conflicts between its members and Russia; direct involvement (of the alliance) in the war; and lack of clarity about NATO's mission, which is to say lack of clarity about whether NATO is a defensive military alliance or an alliance geared toward expeditionary ventures.\n\nNATO has been involved in wars previously -- in Afghanistan and in Libya. NATO has never been involved in a war with a nuclear power. NATO's strategic purpose is to avoid war with Russia or to make such war impossible. Overreach leading to unwanted escalation and in effect to a Russia-NATO war would be catastrophic. It could lead to a nuclear exchange, or it could lead to NATO's backing down (to prevent a nuclear exchange) and thus to NATO's undermining of confidence in the integrity and purpose of the alliance itself.\n\nUnderreach would occur were NATO to be unconcerned with the territory outside its formal perimeter. Were NATO to think of itself as \"fortress NATO,\" preoccupied only with the defense of member states, it could find itself in an increasingly precarious position.\n\nWere Ukraine and Moldova to follow the trajectory of Belarus, NATO would face the Russian military across a very long border: Kaliningrad and Belarus in the north; Ukraine and Moldova in the south and on the Black Sea. The Balkans could become a zone of active contestation. This would be a great multiplicity of challenges for NATO, which Russia could exploit to gain advantage, to instill fear in alliance members, and to compel the United States to pull away from Europe and to concentrate on matters closer to home. Over time, underreach could weaken the alliance dramatically.\n\nNATO will succeed in future years if it can find the golden mean. This means not falling into outright war with Russia; this means preserving the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a Ukrainian state and polity; and this means keeping Russia at bay in the many gray areas that surround the NATO alliance. In sum, NATO's challenges in 2024 are greater than they were in 1949, when the alliance was created. Thus, its adaptability and strategic acumen will have to be greater as well.\n\nMichael Kimmage is a Professor of History at the Catholic University of America.

His most recent book is Collisions: The War in Ukraine and the Origins of the New Global Instability.\n\nThe best development for NATO that one should wish for, I believe (even if the odds against its happening appear daunting at present), is that it should return to its fundamentals: Prevent war, in accordance to its obligation not just to defend all the signatories of the treaty but also to commit itself, in the words of the treaty, \"not to enter into any international commitments that conflicted with the treaty\" and to adhere \"to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\"\n\nThe U.N. Charter states, as its first objective, \"to maintain international peace and security\" and \"uphold international law.\" In other words, in a more perfect world, NATO should work toward peace and not toward managing conflicts solely through military means in the future.\n\nUnfortunately, how NATO probably will develop and change is a very different matter. In his new strategic concept presented at the Madrid Summit in June 2022, Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg set out five points for the development of NATO. Only one of these, \"taking a global outlook,\" was really \"new.\" This \"global outlook\" involves extending the treaty's mandate exponentially. NATO would develop into a supranational organism with tentacles reaching into many corners of the world, if not all.\n\nOn the other hand, a new generation of populist politicians in the United States and Europe will probably not want to take such a \"global outlook\" but will retreat, if trends are anything to go by, to their own shores in the perhaps-mistaken idea that conflicts here and there will not affect them directly.\n\nHowever, the same conflicts ongoing now might already have escalated to the extent that, even a generation ahead, their consequences will instead produce a general desire to project strength, whatever the human consequences. Thus, European nations will have rearmed and retrained their military and will possibly no longer accept the sole leadership of the U.S. in NATO affairs. It will then take a very astute politician to rein in everyone's power instincts: Failing the presence of such a man or woman, NATO could actually break apart amidst exacerbated rivalries, including economic ones, and conflicting nationalist postures and interests.\n\nAnne Kraatz is a Non-Resident Fellow at the Quincy Institute. She was a Senior Fellow at the Institute for Open Diplomacy in Paris, and a member of the Executive Committee of Democrats Abroad in France, in charge of organizing and moderating public debates on U.S. foreign affairs.\n\nNATO was created in 1949 to protect its members against the Soviet threat. During the Cold War, NATO was also very aware of the risks of escalation, some of which were existential. Accordingly, the main aims were to deter armed conflict and to ensure a reliable defense capability. In addition, the alliance sought very early on to contain the risk of a military conflict breaking out by respecting the Soviet Union's central \"red lines\"; it did not even shy away from dialogue and verifiable agreements with an opponent not considered as trustworthy. This attitude found classic expression in the dual strategy from 1967 (the so-called Harmel Report), which is still valid for NATO today. According to this, on the basis of a guaranteed defense capability, NATO was ready for dialogue and détente with the opposing side.\n\nAfter 1989, the bipolar confrontation only seemed to have disappeared. It has not been possible to integrate Russia into a new European security order. Rather, Putin saw that, in particular from the beginning of the 2000s onward, the policies of the U.S. and NATO had not taken into account Russian superpower interests, and that \"red lines\" had been crossed, especially by promising future NATO membership to Ukraine and Georgia. This was also due to the arrogant \"unipolar\" actions of the U.S. administration under George W. Bush and its insensitive focus on military superiority and expanding its and NATO's sphere of influence.\n\nParticularly due to the Russian aggression against Ukraine and the emergence of a Cold War 2.0, it is now important to heed the lessons of NATO's 75-year history:\n\nRegardless of the outcome of the elections in the U.S., however, the European partners must increase their defense efforts in order to focus more on Europe's own security and to be able to assert themselves in the looming phase of global geopolitical upheaval. If this is not possible within the framework of the E.U., a \"core Europe,\" primarily under the leadership of France and Germany, should proceed in order to achieve strategic autonomy in the military area too. This is, moreover, the only way to limit defense spending. At this crucial juncture, the alliance must pursue with sound judgment a realistic security policy aimed at reestablishing sustainable peace and cooperation in Europe and the world.\n\nRüediger Lüedeking is a former German diplomat who served as Permanent Representative to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and Ambassador to Belgium.\n\nIt is imperative for NATO to become more balanced between America and Europe when it comes to burden-sharing. The European members of NATO should organize themselves in a way that they would be able to conduct military operations in their own neighborhood without the direct support of the Americans. While this does not need to be done by the European Union, the E.U. has a key role to play when it comes to providing joint financing for defense procurement and to help develop a European military-industrial policy. Key European members of NATO that are not members of the E.U. -- including the United Kingdom, Norway, and Turkey -- have a lot to offer to such a European pillar of the alliance, and they should be fully integrated into any European defense architecture.\n\nSuch a \"rebalancing\" of the Atlantic alliance -- with the goal of the European members to spend a roughly equal amount of money on defense and having similar military capabilities -- would guarantee that NATO will endure through the 21 century, as it would no longer be subject to the whims of American domestic politics. After all, an international alliance sharing both common interests and common values is equally valuable for both Americans and Europeans, as it would increase both North America's and Europe's influence in the rest of the world, and benefit its citizens by providing stability and security in which their mixed-market economies can continue to grow and thrive.\n\nIn reality, however, there is a substantial risk that European efforts will fall well short of what is needed to achieve a proper rebalancing of NATO. For political economy reasons, current and future American presidents will continue to encourage European allies to buy weapons and military hardware from the United States, and E.U. internal discord over joint financing and the interests of national defense industries will prevent integration of European military procurement. Aging European societies will only increase their demands for more social welfare at the expense of military spending.\n\nIn this scenario, the United States will continue to exert a disproportionate sway over the alliance, which will maintain the unhappy equilibrium of American dominance and European free-riding within NATO, with those perceptions of each side reinforced across the Atlantic, and increased uncertainty over America's future commitment to the alliance. There may also be pressure to expand NATO beyond the Northern Atlantic space, and invite America's democratic allies in the Pacific, including Japan, South Korea, and Australia, to join. NATO would then serve as the U.S. vehicle to contain not only Russia, but also China. If this development materializes, it has the potential of further increasing geopolitical tension between the West and the rest as well as within NATO.\n\nMatthias Matthijs holds the Dean Acheson Chair at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and is a Senior Fellow for Europe at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nAn armistice agreement in Ukraine -- which now seems likely in the foreseeable future -- should include a commitment by NATO and Russia to set verifiable limitations on conventional deployments on either side of a demilitarized truce line. This could either be considered a revamping and redesign of the Conventional Forces in Europe agreement or could be more circumscribed and less ambitious. In either case, for the U.S. in particular, structuring a durable peace would require reactivating diplomatic capacities sidelined during the zero-sum struggle between Russia and NATO.\n\nThe postwar framework should explicitly allow the European members of NATO to increase national defense outlays to achieve a rough balance of conventional capability vis à vis Russia. This would require U.S. acceptance of a collective E.U. role in defense industrial development. The aim of this Europeanization of NATO would be to render the U.S. conventional military force presence in Europe less essential. The U.S. would still extend its nuclear umbrella over NATO members in Europe, but NATO's European pillar would become more capable and have a greater voice in decision-making. NATO should shift its focus from expansion eastward to supporting Europe's development of its conventional defense capabilities, an enterprise likely to take at least a decade.\n\nNATO would remain the principal framework for mutual defense of the Transatlantic West. Russia and NATO should work to revive stabilizing measures to diminish the risk of renewed conflict in Europe, as in the years following the Cuban missile crisis. The restoration of nuclear arms control agreements should be given priority.\n\nThe hard lessons of the last few years have exposed the failure of military power and even the harshest economic sanctions to resolve interstate conflict without unacceptable risk to the broader security interests of all parties. Diplomatic contacts between Russia and the United States would have to be put on a more sober and patient track.\n\nWithout such agreements, the continuation of the war in Ukraine on its current trajectory carries the danger of escalation to direct confrontation between NATO and Russia. The determination of the U.S. and its partners to project unity and resolve in defense of Ukraine has taken on a life of its own and functions as an instrument within an information war, favoring \"narrative\" over reality. The summit in Washington in July risks being absorbed almost entirely in avoidance of any unwelcome controversy over the question of Ukraine's path to membership and in the frantic attempt to make the prospect of eventual NATO membership credible to Ukraine's leadership. Any open debate and frank reflection around shoring up NATO under a possible Trump presidency and exploring scenarios for the end of the war will, at best, remain behind closed doors.\n\nThe nostalgic reification of NATO has played a big role in producing the dilemma now facing us. The July summit will celebrate the revival of U.S. prestige within NATO, the near-unanimity among European allies in supporting \"victory\" for Ukraine, and the restored relevance of NATO in the face of a renewed military threat from Russia to the alliance. The papering over of challenges to NATO and the failure to design and implement reforms will continue so long as there is no consensus around achievable war aims and no effort to find a negotiated end to the conflict.\n\nDr. Molly O'Neal is a Non-Resident Fellow at the Quincy Institute and a former U.S. Foreign Service Officer dealing with Eastern Europe, Russia, and Eurasia.\n\nAlliances are ultimately arrangements between two or more states for security cooperation and are generally targeted against a particular adversary. NATO played this role during the Cold War, with Western European states, Canada, and the United States balancing potential Soviet ambitions on the Continent. Informed by this logic, many analysts predicted NATO's demise after the Cold War; indeed, the alliance's ability to endure and expand in scope (though not coherence and function) after 1991 at least partly motivates claims that the alliance's shared values and institutional anchoring will allow it to thrive in future.\n\nYet there is a simpler explanation for NATO's post-Cold War endurance that ought to give us pause as to NATO's future health. If alliances form largely in response to threats, it follows that they ought to end not simply when an old threat dies, but when a new threat emerges at the same time. From this perspective, the end of the Cold War saw the Soviet Union die, but because no new threat emerged, NATO could continue unimpeded. NATO became a Swiss Army Knife for spreading liberal values, fighting terrorism, and establishing an array of new goals.\n\nToday, however, the situation is different: Domestic politics aside, we see a growing disconnect between European and American priorities. The United States is increasingly focused on China, so much so that the (overstated) China threat is one of the true points of bipartisan consensus in Washington. European states, on the other hand, are divided between those who see a pronounced threat from Russia and those who see an array of challenges from illegal migration and state instability along the southern maritime border.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, NATO's days may be numbered -- at least in its current form. States with diverging or divergent interests can try to paper over their differences. In a world of finite time and resources, however, differing priorities tend to drive alliances apart, as member states place their bets and act out of self-interest. With NATO, this may not result in an abrupt end to transatlantic cooperation, but it does imply a progressive weakening of the commitment, waning coordination, and a hollowing out of the alliance.\n\nIf and as American and European attentions continue to part, the United States may increasingly pass the security buck to the European members of the alliance. Without the ability to steer European security policy, Washington may well look to reduce its exposure to European contingencies -- just as many in Europe may be increasingly growing reluctant to count on U.S. assistance amid a crisis in which, for self-interested reasons, Washington may be unwilling to help. A result could be a NATO that remains alive on paper but, in practice, is primarily a European show.\n\nThis would not be a bad result for the United States. Indeed, the founders of the alliance actually wanted NATO to be a temporary expedient, a shield behind which Western Europe could recover from the devastation of the Second World War before taking on the hard task of balancing the Soviet Union. That original idea was lost for much of the last seven decades. Yet, as NATO celebrates its 75th birthday, geopolitical developments -- more so than domestic politics -- may bring the founders' vision back to the fore.\n\nJoshua Shifrinson is an Associate Professor in the School of Public Policy of the University of Maryland, and author of Rising Titans, Falling Giants: How Great Powers Exploit Power Shifts (2023).\n\nHow NATO should and will develop over the next generation depends entirely on a guess about what happens geopolitically.\n\nFew alliances last even NATO's 75 years. As an institution, NATO is too weak to perpetuate itself against key members' wishes. The alliance will, as always, be fractious, and it's harder to manage with 32+ nations than with the original 12. The U.S. interest in sustaining NATO is in secular decline. Some have predicted that NATO cannot last without the U.S. And an E.U.-based version of NATO is perfectly conceivable if a President Trump or similar were to pull America out.\n\nSo, seen from the outside, it's reasonable to wonder whether NATO will even exist a generation from now. But, viewed from the inside, NATO has staying power. It exists not just to keep Russia out and America in, but to keep Western and Central Europe from disintegrating again along national lines. Presidents Putin and Trump have massively increased European incentives for hanging together -- preferably with but, if necessary, without America.\n\nMy guess is that a generation from now, NATO will still be in sustained military confrontation with Russia; Washington will still not want Europe -- its largest trading and investment partner -- to fall apart, even if the U.S. becomes a semidetached ally; and an E.U.-based alternative still could not rope in British, Turkish, and Norwegian capabilities as effectively.\n\nIn that anxious security context, NATO should develop a European pillar in tighter collaboration with the E.U., pursuing common European procurement goals and smoothing transatlantic defense industrial frictions through NATO's defense planning process. It should remain open to new members who can increase alliance security, including Ukraine. It should secure the Euro-Atlantic for America, leaving the U.S. and other individual allies to operate in the Indo-Pacific. It should be the arms control organization it claims to be, advancing proposals to Moscow to manage confrontation at lower levels of risk and higher levels of deterrence. It should work to be seen internationally as a valued stability generator in an unstable world, investing heavily in its partnerships for military professionalism under democratic political control.\n\nAnd how will NATO in fact develop? Outlier possibilities exist for more significant damage to its cohesion and effectiveness from America's isolationism and China focus, E.U. ideology and incoherence, British and Turkish E.U. complications, Russian and Chinese erosions, and the continuing lack of a shared vision among allies.\n\nIt will be both less European and less transatlantic than it needs to be, less robust and more threatening toward Moscow than it needs to be, more internally factional than it ought to be, and less confident than it should be about working intimately with the E.U. and U.N. on geographical and functional instabilities. It may have lost Hungary and Bulgaria to Russian influence, and it will have gained Ukraine, formally or otherwise. It will be badly divided over China. Strong anti-Americanism in Europe will complicate public politics, but Europe's structural inefficiencies will mean the U.S. is still the essential partner.",

        "summary": "The article discusses the future of NATO as it marks its 75th anniversary, highlighting the alliance's challenges and potential developments. Analysts from the U.S. and Europe agree that NATO faces a difficult period, particularly due to its current proxy conflict with Russia over Ukraine. The article outlines several key points:\n\n1. **Historical Context**: NATO's success during the Cold War was attributed to deterrence and caution, avoiding direct conflict with the Soviet Union. Post-Cold War, NATO's expansion and efforts to roll back Russian influence have led to increased tensions.\n\n2. **Current Challenges**: The war in Ukraine has intensified NATO's focus on collective defense, but it also risks direct conflict with Russia, potentially leading to nuclear war. Analysts predict continued hostility between Russia and the West, with potential flashpoints like Belarus and Kaliningrad.\n\n3. **European Rearmament**: European NATO members are expected to rearm, especially if U.S. commitment wavers, but economic constraints and resistance to pooling military resources pose challenges. NATO may also seek a global role to contain China.\n\n4. **Internal Tensions**: If the U.S. reduces its involvement, NATO might limit its expansion and focus on defending existing members, leading to policy disagreements among members regarding Russia.\n\n5. **Neglected Issues**: The war in Ukraine has overshadowed other threats like climate change and instability in regions south of NATO, which could become more pressing in the future.\n\n6. **Strategic Autonomy**: Analysts suggest that Europe should develop its own defense capabilities to reduce reliance on the U.S., potentially through initiatives like Germany's Sky Shield for air defense.\n\n7. **Future Scenarios**: NATO's future could involve a more balanced burden-sharing between the U.S. and Europe, or it could face internal divisions and a shift in focus towards global challenges like China.\n\n8. **Diplomatic Efforts**: A potential armistice in Ukraine could involve NATO and Russia setting limitations on military deployments, with Europe taking a larger role in its own defense.\n\n9. **Institutional Evolution**: NATO may need to adapt by focusing on regional security and addressing non-military threats like migration and climate change, rather than expanding its global reach.\n\nOverall, the article emphasizes the need for NATO to balance its traditional defense role with new strategic challenges, while fostering greater European autonomy in defense matters."

The government has already reduced cash incentives for exporters by Tk 3,400 crore this year,\" he said.\n\n\"If the government wants to make us competitive in the global market, cash incentives should continue without any reductions until 2029. Additionally, alternative incentives for exporters should be introduced as per the commitment made by government officials,\" added the BGMEA president.\n\nHowever, Dr Ahsan H Mansur, executive director of the Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh, believes there is no need to revise or delay the transition from LDC status to a developed country by 2026.\n\nHe said that the government should support exporters in reaching export targets by 2027, noting that exporters will now need to double their exports to achieve this goal.\n\nThe government should also ensure adequate port facilities, simplify customs procedures, provide uninterrupted gas and electricity, and diversify the export basket to increase export volumes, he added.",

Nearly all have focused on the candidates' delivery, less on what they said, and almost nothing about what should have been but was not said.\n\nTrump was obviously coached by his team to tone down the personal insults, which he mostly did, and scored some policy points while making dozens of false or unverified statements in the process.\n\nMeanwhile, as the general media analysis has also gone, Biden's delivery was a disaster. As one well known TV commentator called it: \"a slow motion car accident\".\n\nThe CNN host network's post-debate analysis panel was particularly critical.\n\nAt least initially. In the post-debate commentary they offered initial assessments like:\n\nhe (Biden) \"seemed disoriented\" and delivered \"an atypically bad performance\" (David Axelrod).\n\n\"His candidacy has fallen\" (Scott Jennings). He was \"not coherent\" and \"real damage was done\" (Abby Phillips).\n\n\"He failed...No two ways about it\" (Kate Bidingfield).\n\nSeasoned election commentator for CNN, John King, called Biden's performance \"dismal\" and said there was now deep panic in the Democrat party. While perhaps the most liberal on the panel, Van Jones, described Biden's delivery as \"painful\", noting the debate was the 'Con Man vs. the Old Man' and the affair appeared as a debate between \"somebody who shouldn't be president and another who can't do the job\".\n\nMany of Biden's harshest critics on the panel were long time Democrat party operatives, like Axelrod, Jones, and Bidingfield. The harshest criticism was leveled afterward by former Presidential debate moderator, Chris Wallace, author of the aforementioned quote \"A car accident in slow motion\". He concluded \"he sunk his campaign tonight\".\n\nIt's clear that several of the panelists were by means of their ear phones connected during the debate with high ranking Democrat party donors and supporters. Van Jones and Axelrod, long time Democrat party operatives and advisers, both referred to calls they were getting during the debate. As Axelrod admitted \"Democrat Party leaders area reacting\" and in a state of panic over Biden's performance. Jones said he even received calls well in the middle of the panel discussion, during a commercial break by CNN, in which he was 'chewed out' by a Biden insider for his previous panel comments.\n\nNot surprising, as the panel discussion went on some of the panelists tried to walk back their earlier public criticism which was contributing to the 'panic', according to some party sources. It's likely that some of the CNN panelists won't be around for subsequent debates if they occur. Or at least they won't be allowed to wear ear phones.\n\nAnyone watching the debate and the post debate commentary might easily conclude that Trump was not all that impressive, reducing his statements and rebuttals every chance he had to the border immigration issue; or making statements like 'he's killing the country\" and \"what he has done is criminal\"; or throwing out wild unsubstantiated charges declaring Biden's policies on abortion led to doctors to killing eight or nine month old.\n\nBiden debated in the dirt no less, often focusing on Trump's infidelity affairs and, in one of his few entertaining 'one liners' declaring \"you (Trump) have the morality of an alleycat\" or \"you're a whinner\". How many times each rebutted the other by simply calling him a 'liar' probably set a record for presidential debates.\n\nAs presidential debates go, this time around the CNN moderators asked no trick questions -- as occurred in prior presidential debates -- and their questions challenged the candidates to address some serious points. But when it came to explaining their policies and proposals neither candidate performed very well. They either ignored the moderators' questions altogether, or drifted off point, slide into another of their favorite topics, or descended into the silliest and most childish attacks on their opponent.\n\nPoll after poll today shows American voters are most concerned about two issues: Economy and War. But anyone watching the debate got no idea what either candidate intended to do for the economy stuck in chronic inflation, interest rates, weakening job market, declining real wages, and a growing fiscal crisis marked by the past eight years of $13.3 trillion additional budget deficits and $14.9 trillion in added national debt. Since 2000 deficits and debt have been doubling every eight years and the worst eight have been the most recent, 2016-2024, under Trump and Biden.\n\nWhen it came to answering the moderators' questions on the economy, Trump ducked their questions altogether several times, used the question to slip into elaborating further on one of his favorite themes like the border, or just answered with an off the wall personal accusation of Biden.\n\nBiden did no better: he mumbled, changed his topic and sentence mid-stream, confused words, and hesitated with long pauses as if he lost his train of thought. At one point after saying the US had a thousand trillionaires, then correcting it to billionaires, he mumbled incoherently for almost a half minute, lost his thought, and ended with a topically unrelated phrase \"we finally beat Medicare\". Trump predictably jumped on it and rebutted, 'Yes, you beat Medicare to death'.\n\nThese kind of petty, juvenile exchanges went on all during the debate. Perhaps the most pathetic, however, was late in the debate when both candidates got into a pissing match over who had the lowest golf handicap. Somehow they then both segwayed into accusing the other being the unhealthiest. Biden charged Trump of being too fat, to which Trump replied he had taken two health tests and passed both with excellent results while Biden hadn't taken even one.\n\nAt that point, following the golf thing, most watchers must have said to themselves: 'what the hell are they talking about'? Then probably followed that by saying to themselves, 'holy shit are we really in trouble'!. Yes, the USA is in trouble. Big trouble. And both the candidates aren't really talking about it. Nor have the slightest idea what to do about it.\n\nWhich brings it all back to what the American voters wanted most to hear in the debate but didn't -- i.e. what are the two lightweights called Trump and Biden going to do about escalating War and declining Economy?\n\nPolls consistently show voters want to know what are the candidates' proposals for dealing with inflation, jobs, runaway annual trillion dollar US budget deficits, the $35 trillion US national debt -- not to mention unaffordable housing, healthcare, child care, and student debt? And on the geopolitical front: what would either do as president about the three wars the US is involved in (Ukraine, Gaza, Red Sea) -- and the fourth that is obviously being planned (Taiwan)?\n\nVery little was revealed by either candidate during the debate as to how they planned to deal with the voters' top issues of War and the Economy. Here's what was not said by the candidates on the real issues of import:\n\nThe Economy\n\nThe very first question the moderators asked the candidates was the state of the US economy. Moderators noted many voters felt the economy was 'worse off', with groceries up 20% and home prices 30% since 2020.\n\nJobs\n\nBiden ducked the inflation question and launched into a statement how great the economy was now. His main point in that regard was his claim he had created 15 million jobs since taking office. That claim, however, is a misrepresentation and a selective interpretation of government statistics that he and the Democrats have been peddling throughout the campaign.\n\nThe fact is the Covid recession of 2020 resulted in 35 million being unemployed at one time or another due to government mandated economic shutdown. When Biden took office in 2021 there were 12-13 million still jobless. The US economy began to reopen in late spring 2021. It was too early. It aborted and only began again to steadily and slowly reopen later that summer 2021. It was in late summer 2021 when inflation began to accelerate.\n\nOver the next two years the twelve million mandated jobless returned to the jobs they had left. But these were not new jobs Biden 'created'. These were jobs workers 'returned to'. Biden did not create those 12 million jobs. There were additionally some net new jobs created in addition to those 'returned to' over the course of Biden's term. About 2.7 million. However, they have been mostly part time jobs not full time. Only by manipulating the numbers is Biden able to claim he created 15 million jobs.\n\nAs for the unemployment rate of 4% and Biden's claim it's the lowest in decades, that too is questionable. The 4% is what the US Labor Dept. calls the U-3 unemployment rate which refers only to full time workers. The government has another statistic that rarely gets reported in the mainstream media. It's called the U-6 unemployment rate and it covers not only full time workers but part time, those who've given up looking for work, dropped out of the labor force altogether, and simply haven't filed for unemployment benefits even though they're jobless. That also official US government U-6 unemployment rate is 7.4%, not 4%; or almost twice the always reported lower U-3 number by the mainstream media.\n\nTrump of course had no idea about these clarifications of Biden's misleading jobs claims. Nor apparently did his advisers. So Trump simply failed to challenge Biden on these job numbers.\n\nInflation\n\nThe moderator's question about why many voters don't feel economically 'better of' included a reference to a basket of groceries up 20% and home prices 30% since Biden. Biden's answer was he brought prescription drug prices down, referring to insulin prices for seniors on Medicare.\n\nTrump said he did it. Biden said he did. What ensued was a 'he said, she said' silly exchange. But the fact is prescription drug prices in general are going through the roof. And drug price inflation is not accurately picked up by the official US government inflation statistics. For example, he newest drugs aren't included. Nor factored into inflation are pharmaceutical companies moving their existing drugs into higher 'tiers' in their formulary (list of drug prices).The most purchased drugs' prices are raised more than average, while thousands of drugs not purchased hardly any more are not. The result is a lower average price for all drugs that the government uses in its inflation statistics.\n\nIt was at this point following the drug price inflation, only three minutes into the debate, that Biden went off the rails mumbling incoherently about several unrelated topics, going silent for loss of words, and concluding with the \"we finally beat Medicare\" comment.\n\nIf Trump had been prepared he could have elaborated on what's really happening with the costs of medical services -- a topic on which Biden remained silent for good reason since hospital and medical services are recently among the fastest rising services inflation.\n\nBiden instead repeated his campaign line that more people now have medical insurance than ever before. But at what cost? And how much coverage given the higher cost? According to research by the Kaiser Family Foundation, monthly health insurance premiums for a $65k/yr median income family of four are now about $2,000/mo. ($23,968/yr); for an individual $8,435 a year. Moreover, for 51% of households the same monthly premiums have deductibles of $2k-$3k per year. The other 49% households have deductibles of $600-$900/yr. What good is medical insurance coverage if the cost of insurance is unaffordable?\n\nThe debate moderators indicated housing prices had risen 30% and asked what either candidate would do about it. Once again, Trump ducked the question altogether and went on to rail about the border, immigration, and rapes and deaths caused by terrorists and criminals at the border. Biden too ducked the question, trying to turn it into the topic of tax cuts -- Trump's and his.\n\nHere's why both candidates didn't want to talk about housing costs or inflation in general:\n\nAccording to the Wall St. Journal in a recent June 2024 survey, home prices have surged 50% not 30% as the moderators noted. But even that 30% is a gross underestimate. What people pay is a mortgage which includes interest charges and other fees not just a monthly principal on the price of the house. Nor are any other interest costs, in credit cards, auto loans or any other source. If they were, the government's formal price indexes would be much higher since the CPI does not include in its inflation estimate any of the above mortgages, fees, etc. And according to the Wall St. Journal, 'Home Monthly Mortgage Payments' have risen 114% under Biden.\n\nRent prices follow home mortgages. But US government's price indexes like CPI and PCE only record 'new leases', not renters whose landlords raised their existing rents. Then there's the further trend of landlords adding all kinds of new monthly fees to their rents. That too is not picked up in the official inflation stats. Even so, government limited statistics still show rent increases exceeding 20% since 2021. In reality, it's at least 30-40% and far more in some cases.\n\nPrices for processed foods have also surged since 2019. These prices are subject to big monopolistic corporations' price gouging. Processed foods inflation is responsible for most of the 35% rise in the most often purchased grocery goods since 2019, according to the Journal.\n\nGovernment statistics show many basic household food staples have risen significantly since 2019: Bread up 52%, Eggs 114%. Pound of chicken breast 37%. Milk 24%. And food 'away from home' category (restaurants, bars, etc.) is also rising faster than reported. For example, the US statistics for 'food away from home' don't include the recent ratcheting up of tips charges, in some restaurants mandatory. Tip rates used to be 10%, 15% and 18% at most. Now it's an automatic 18%, 22% or 25% to the restaurant bill. Fast food away from home, that many low income households rely upon, has fared no better. Statistics show that a 'Big Mac' meal is up 27% since 2019.\n\nTransportation is the third largest weighted category in the inflation statistics. It includes the prices of autos, auto insurance, repairs, cost of a gallon of gas and other items. Car prices surged in 2021-23 and then leveled off, making the latest year stats appear 'tamed'. But auto insurance has accelerated by more than 20% the past year alone, following auto repair services up by at least that amount. Gasoline initially accelerated in 2021-2022 due to global and domestic supply issues, then leveled off. When prices 'level off' it appears the inflation has abated. But consumers remain paying the previous higher prices and that's what they remember. Consumers remember they are now paying 38% more for a gallon of gas since Biden took office.\n\nPoliticians, mainstream media, and many mainstream professional economists have been spinning the message that the US economy is doing great. Inflation is under control. Unemployment low. As Biden said during the debate \"The US is the greatest economy in the world\". But consumers know what they're actually paying, workers know what they're actually getting paid and the extra jobs they have to take on to make ends meet. Consumers and workers have longer memories than the politicians, media and economists want them to have. They know what the inflation and job score is since 2019. And don't care that much what the others say about the last six months or even year.\n\nIn short, the tens of millions of the roughly 130 million households in the USA know when the politicians or their mainstream economists echo chamber keep telling them 'Oh, the economy is doing great!' is not the reality they face.\n\nTax Cuts\n\nAt another point in the debate the moderators raised the question of Trump's 2018 tax cuts and if the candidates, especially Trump, would once again support the extension of the cuts coming up in 2025. Trump totally ducked the question, except to say his tax cuts -- which by the way amounted to $4.5 trillion over a decade -- produced a massive number of jobs. That job creation of course did not occur. The tax cuts of 2018 went mostly to wealthy investors and US businesses and corporations, who then either hoarded the savings or plowed it back into financial markets or invested abroad. Very little went into investments that resulted in business expansion that created jobs.\n\nUnder Trump's first three years before Covid hit in 2020, the Fortune 500 corporations returned more than $3.5 trillion in stock buybacks and dividend payouts to their shareholders. Under Biden it's been closer to $4 trillion. During the debate Biden indicated he wanted to raise taxes on individuals earning more than $400k a year in income. That was blocked by Senators Manchin and Sinema of his own party, as were efforts in general to roll back Trump's $4.5 trillion. Biden refused to pressure either of these rogue Senators the past three years. Both are now leaving the Senate. Moderators should have asked Biden, now that Manchin and Sinema will be gone, if he now will reverse the Trump tax cuts if elected.\n\nDeficits & Debt\n\nOn the matter of the budget deficit which has been chronically running at more than $1T a year since 2019 and is expected to hit $1.9T this year, neither candidate had much to say. Trump mentioned it in general and Biden not at all. Nor did either say anything about how the accumulation of those annual deficits have created the current national debt of $35 trillion -- with annual interest payments of more than $800 billion and rising.\n\nBoth candidates' virtual silence to discuss the topics of deficit and debt likely had something to do with the fact that both of them have been responsible for record levels of deficits and debt on their watch: annual budget deficits rose $5.5T under Trump and $7.8T under Biden. The national debt accelerated an addition $7.7T under Trump and $7.2T under Biden. It's important to note that the record acceleration in both deficits and national debt occurred within just four years for Trump and Biden -- exceeding the levels attained over eight years in the case of both George W. Bush and Barack Obama. In short, Trump's contribution to escalating deficits and debt were just as bad as Biden's. No wonder neither candidate wanted to 'go there' and discuss the issue. Pointing fingers at the other would amount only to pointing fingers at themselves.\n\nMeanwhile, the continuing escalation of both deficits and debt constitute a major economic issue, as the driving forces for both -- tax cuts for corporations and the rich, slow growth of the economy despite massive fiscal stimulus, and chronic wars and their costs -- are policies both candidates fully endorse in their actions if not their campaign rhetoric. What would they do if elected about the trillion dollar plus annual US deficits and debt -- a question directly asked by the moderators -- was essentially ignored by both candidates.\n\nMeanwhile, a fiscal train wreck of the US economy is emerging that will result in massive social spending cuts in 2025 and after. But no one addressed that either. The moderators didn't even raise it.\n\nTariffs\n\nBiden challenged Trump's recently announced proposal to raise tariffs on all imports and use the revenue to eliminate the corporate income tax. He charged it would be inflationary as corporations passed on the higher costs to consumers. Trump hit back with the charge he (Biden) has been agreeing with his tariff policy by continuing his (Trump) tariffs and expanding them against China as well. But that exchange about tariffs was as far as both candidates went in discussing the increasingly unstable global economy. The subject of the state of the global economy and its consequences for the US was simply 'several pay grades' beyond their intellect.\n\nMissing in the debate as well was any discussion whatsoever as to how the Biden sanctions on Russia and China have encouraged the rapid expansion of the BRICS countries. Formerly five countries, since Biden's sanctions policies the BRICS have doubled in number to 11 with 25 more applying for membership this year. Nor was it asked how the BRICS's forthcoming new global financial structure later this year will impact the US economy in 2025 and beyond.\n\nThat growth of the BRICS and its consequences is perhaps the single most important global economic development unfolding today. However, what the BRICS expansion means for the US economy was never even raised in the debates, let alone debated.\n\nTo sum up regarding the quality of the debate on the topic of the economy, neither candidate had the capacity, or even apparently any interest, in addressing the critical economic issues the country faces. Both candidates either ducked questions by the moderators that were related to economic matters or diverted the discussion to their pet topics when the moderators raised important economic issues. In other words, neither proposed solutions to the pressing economic issues voters want to hear.\n\nThe Wars\n\nThe same inability and/or refusal to explain how they'd deal with the deepening US involvement in the wars abroad further characterized the presidential debate.\n\nOrganizers began setting up early Monday morning on the University of Oregon campus in Eugene. They say the encampment isn't intended to interfere with campus activities or classes. (Source: Nathan Wilk / KLCC)\n\nThe USA is currently mired in three wars -- all of which appear to be intensifying:\n\nUkraine, Israel in Gaza and soon perhaps Lebanon, and in the Red Sea with Yemen.\n\nBiden's regime has been paying the bills for all, totaling at least $300 billion so far -- i.e. a major cause of the US deteriorating budget deficits and national debt. The USA is also deeply involved in providing weapons in all three; and increasingly as well in manpower in the form of advisers and officers on the ground in Ukraine and Israel, and a full US navy carrier task force in the Red Sea. Direct weapons and other financial aid costs has amounted at least to $200-$250 billion; add another minimum $50 billion in Pentagon OCO (overseas contingent operations) costs.\n\nUnfortunately the candidates were not even asked if the US can continue to afford that level of spending; or if the returns so far have justified it.\n\nWhen asked on the subject before the debate Biden's response has been consistently that the US can afford multiple wars. As he put it: 'What do you mean. This is the United States of America. The most powerful country the world has even seen!\"\n\nHis view the US can afford and fight multiple wars has been echoed by other members of his administration, like Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. However, neither Biden or Yellen have said who will have to do with less in order to continue to pay for USA's multiplying war involvement -- which by many estimates exceeds $8 trillion in the past two decades? Where's the money in the next four years to come from: What social programs will be cut in 2025-28 if either is elected? Whose taxes raised? Or how much more debt will have to be issued by the US Treasury on top of the US current $35 trillion national debt -- the latter now projected to rise to $54 trillion by 2033 with annual interest costs well over $1 trillion/yr payable to bondholders?\n\nThe only detailed exchange on Wars between the candidates was Afghanistan.\n\nBiden bragged \"we got 100,000 out\". To which Trump retorted that US soldiers died in the retreat which was hastily and sloppily conducted, made the US look weak and somehow, per Trump, encouraged Putin to invade Ukraine. Those remarks opened the door for Biden to jump into his favorite war subject: the Ukraine conflict.\n\nHe accused Trump of giving the green light to Putin to invade -- i.e. contradicting the history of events from June 2021 to February 2022 during which Biden policy was to refuse to even talk to Putin, rejected all requests to do so, and instead encouraged Zelensky in Ukraine to make increasingly provocative statements about joining NATO and intentions to militarily invade the eastern Ukraine provinces. Trump criticized Biden's Afghanistan pull out but never understood it as a link in the Biden decision in early 2021 to provoke war in Ukraine. The USA retreat from Afghanistan was a 'clearly of the decks' to prepare for war with Ukraine.\n\nBiden's remarks on the war in Ukraine avoided the moderator's direct question what did he plan to do about it.\n\nInstead, Biden repeated one-liners straight out the 1970s cold war era saying\n\n\"Putin is a war criminal. He wants to restore the Soviet Empire and won't stop there\".\n\nOr \"Just see what happens to Poland if Putin wins in Ukraine\".\n\nIn other words, the old 'dominoes theory'. Just as that view was the center piece of US ideology during the Vietnam war, Biden's view of the war in Ukraine is taken from the US war justification playbook during the 1970s. The moderators' question how would he address the US wars abroad was a non starter. Biden answered indirectly 'he wouldn't'. Biden policy is US can afford multiple wars which he intends to continue.\n\nLater in the debate Biden spouted even more worn out 1970s ideology about US power. So the debate audience was treated to such statements during the debate like: \"we're needed to protect the world. We're a powerful nation.\" And then the kicker: \"everybody trusts us\". Listening to Biden one gets the impression we're half a century back in the old cold war with the USSR. Even more scary, he apparently actually believes he is?\n\nTrump's line of argument on Ukraine as well as Israel was as simplistic: if he were president the wars wouldn't have happened. Somehow, he suggested, he would have been so threatening to all sides of the conflicts in Israel-Gaza and Ukraine that they would have cowered in fear of his threats and not gone to war in the first place.\n\nSo there was no need to explain what to do about them now; they wouldn't have happened.\n\nIn the case of Israel, when asked by moderators if he, Trump, supported a Palestinian state he dodged the question and instead criticized Biden for restraining Israel: \"Biden's holding Israel back. Israel wants to go. Let them go\". Trump's animus toward Iran is well known. It is likely he wouldn't need much encouragement to provoke a war with Iran should that latter country support its Hezbollah allies in the event of an Israel attack into Lebanon. Trump may be 'softer' on the Ukraine war but even more aggressive than Biden on a middle east one focusing on Iran. It wouldn't be the first time a US president ended one war and, to placate the pro-war forces in the US, start up another.\n\nOn the Ukraine war Trump was, and has been, more amenable to forcing a compromise with the Russians. In the debate, and on many occasions before, his main charge against Biden is the cost of Ukraine so far, which to date is in excess of $200 billion according to Trump. So the main problem is the US is spending too much money on it. Get the Europeans to cough up more is the suggestion. In a sense, Trump's position on Ukraine is an extension of his more general view that Europe/NATO should pay more.\n\nTo sum up Trump on the Israel and Ukraine wars: neither would have happened. He would have been tough and intervened and gotten all sides to settle beforehand. Israel is different than Ukraine, however. Iran has always been on Trump's shit list; Russia has not. So based on his comments in the debate, if elected he would likely approve a broader war in middle east if it meant going after Iran. Which seems somewhat ironic since, in the debate, he accused Biden of war policies as \"driving us to World War 3\".\n\nBiden's view on Ukraine is apparently just to continue as is. In place of answering the moderators' question how he might resolve the conflict, it's clear Biden's generalities in the debate mean let the war continue. Resolution occurs only when Russia is defeated. After all, if he's not, the Russians will eventually march on Paris! He didn't say Paris, but did say Poland. Dominoes again! Spending money on the wars may have been the core concern of Trump, but for Biden money is not the question. The US and NATO should spend as much of it as needed.\n\nOn Israel Biden refused to get specific. He said little if anything since the US position is to let Israel proceed in Gaza, fund whatever it asks of the US, and do what it must to prevent a further attack on Israel from other quarters or at least to contain it and prevent a wider war breaking out. However, none of this was discussed in the debate by Biden.\n\nThe other two wars -- Red Sea with the Houthis and with China over Taiwan -- were never raised as questions and therefore easily avoided altogether by both candidates. A simple query from the moderators might have been: 'why is a full task force of the US Navy unable to stop the Yemenis from sinking ships and preventing two thirds of the normal flow of container shipping traffic through the Red Sea'? Or how much is it costing the US to maintain a carrier task force off the Arabian peninsula?\n\nAnd then there's biggest war in planning by the USA: against China in Taiwan. Not a word asked, and not a word said about Biden administration plans now being implemented to prepare for a war with China over Taiwan. Moderators could at least have asked about recent US admirals and generals stationed in the far east who have publicly been saying war with China was inevitable and coming by 2030?\n\nOr the moderators might have asked: 'why are US Marines now landing and occupying Philippine islands within view of Taiwan and elsewhere in the South China sea and training again to carry out amphibious landings?\n\nOne can understand why Biden, the author of the pending conflict, wouldn't want to debate such matters. Perhaps the moderators got that message before developing their lists of questions. Or maybe the questions list was vetted by the parties (which was the case in fact). But Trump limited his criticisms of Biden China policy during the debate to the topic of tariffs.\n\nApart from questions of War and Economy there were other glaring omissions in the debate. At one point the moderators specifically did ask each candidate what they would do about the fact 2023 was the hottest year on record? Biden said he passed legislation -- presumably the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 -- that subsidized businesses investing in alternative energy. Biden also hyped his 'climate corps' idea. Trump ducked the question of climate change, referring instead to the need for 'clean water and clean air'. Both candidates briefly indulged in an unintelligible discussion of the Paris Climate Accords.\n\nIn other words, there was not much substantive discussion over what is in fact a 5th war underway: the war on Nature. Or rather one should say Nature's war on us which Nature so far is winning. Neither candidate thus answered the moderators' question on 2023 the hottest year on record which is another way of saying: what are you going to do to prevent the climate from warming to the 2 degrees or more tipping point to which it is on track by 2035? Just as the candidates failed to provide answers how they would resolve the four US wars underway or in planning, so too the 5th was brushed off and left unanswered.\n\n*\n\nNote to readers: Please click the share button above.

        "summary": "The article \"The Presidential Debate That Wasn't\" from Global Research critiques the first U.S. presidential debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. It highlights that the debate was marked by poor performances from both candidates, with Biden's delivery being particularly criticized by media analysts and Democrat operatives. The debate failed to address key voter concerns such as the economy and ongoing wars. Both candidates avoided substantive discussions on critical issues like inflation, job creation, housing costs, and the national debt. They also did not provide clear plans for handling U.S. involvement in multiple international conflicts, including those in Ukraine, Gaza, and the Red Sea. The article suggests that neither candidate demonstrated a clear understanding or strategy for addressing the pressing economic and geopolitical challenges facing the country."

        "body": "London, Jul 3 (PTI) Stop Labour Party's \"supermajority\" is the final message British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is trying to drive home on Wednesday, the last day of campaigning ahead of polling day on Thursday, as most of the incumbent Conservatives seem to have all but conceded defeat in the landmark general election.\n\n\"This is what unites us. We need to stop the Labour supermajority that will put up your taxes. The only way to do that is to vote Conservative tomorrow,\" said the 44-year-old British Indian Conservative Party leader on social media, as he focused on drumming up support in the last few hours of the campaign trail.\n\nAlso Read | Pakistan: PTI Chief Imran Khan Seeks Permission From Rawalpindi Court To Meet His Sons, Qasim and Sulaiman, in Adiala Jail.\n\nWith his party trailing far behind the Keir Starmer-led Labour Party, Sunak and his team's strategy seems to be to canvas their traditional voters to ensure a strong enough turnout in the polls on Thursday and narrow the gap of their widely expected defeat after Tory victories in the last three elections.\n\n\"I totally accept where the polls are at the moment means that tomorrow is likely to see the largest Labour landslide majority - the largest majority that this country has ever seen. Much bigger than 1997,\" Sunak's Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride told the BBC.\n\nAlso Read | Russia-Ukraine War: Russian Missiles and Drones Strike Dnipro in Daylight Attack, Killing at Least 5, Injuring 47.\n\n\"I have accepted that where the polls are at the moment... that we are therefore tomorrow highly likely to be in a situation where [Labour has] the largest majority that any party has ever achieved,\" he said, effectively conceding his party's defeat.\n\nIt is being seen as a fear tactic to jolt Tory voters into action, with the hope of keeping the Labour majority under that won by former prime minister Tony Blair-led Labour Party in 1997 of 179 seats.\n\n\"Thursday's vote is now all about forming a strong enough Opposition. One needs to read the writing on the wall: it's over, and we need to prepare for the reality and frustration of the Opposition,\" Suella Braverman, sacked as home secretary by Sunak, told 'The Telegraph' newspaper.\n\nDuring a hectic final two days of campaigning Sunak has said that the outcome of the election is \"not a foregone conclusion.\"\n\n\"People can see that we have turned a corner,\" Sunak, who has been in office since October 2022.\n\n\"It has been a difficult few years, but undeniably things are in a better place now than they were,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, former prime minister Boris Johnson - not exactly a close ally of Sunak ever since the partygate scandal of COVID pandemic law-breaking parties - was also rolled out by the party at a campaign event in London to warn against a \"sledgehammer majority\" being handed to the Keir Starmer led Labour Party.\n\n\"When Rishi asked me to come and help, of course I couldn't say no. We're all here because we love our country,\" Johnson told a cheering Tory crowd.\n\n\"They can achieve nothing in this election except to usher in the most left-wing Labour government since the war with a huge majority, and we must not let it happen,\" he warned.\n\nThe Labour Party, meanwhile, is keen to override this message of victory as a foregone conclusion a day before the polls to fight against any complacency within the ranks and among its own voter base.\n\n\"People are saying the polls predict the future - they don't predict the future, every single vote counts, every single vote has to be earned... It isn't 'job done',\" said Starmer.\n\nStarmer on Wednesday said the claims of the governing Conservatives that his party is on course for a very large election victory in Thursday's election amounted to \"voter suppression\".\n\nHe said: \"It's really voter suppression.\"\n\nStride was \"trying to get people to stay home rather than go out and vote,\" he was quoted as saying by the BBC.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at a campaign election event, he said: \"If you want change you have to vote for it.\n\n\"I know there are very close constituencies across the country, I don't take anything for granted.\n\n\"I respect the voters, and I know that we have to earn every vote until 10 o'clock tomorrow night,\" who hopes to be the next British prime minister, said.\n\nPolling experts have forecast a low turnout, which stood at 67 per cent in the last general election in December 2019 when Johnson won a solid majority on his \"get Brexit done\" message.\n\nOn Thursday, polling booths will open across the country at 7 am local time and close at 10 pm local time as voters elect their MPs for the UK Parliament's 650 constituencies - with 326 required for a majority and to avert a hung Parliament.\n\nAll eyes will then be on the election night exit poll at 10 pm, which gives a fair snapshot of what can be expected nationally as the counting commences and centres up and down the UK. If opinion polls are to be believed, the incumbent Tories are in line to win anywhere between 53 and 150 seats, with Labour projected to win a landslide.",

        "body": "\"If you poke the Russian bear with a stick, don't be surprised if he responds.\" -- Nigel Farage , UK Reform party\n\nWhat Napoleon and Hitler failed to do, NATO and EU got into the expansion game by breaking USSR to Russia in the 1991 breakup. The US goal is to weaken Russia as a military power. US Secretary Austin said, \"We want Ukraine to win. One of our goals has been to limit Russia's ability that's why we are arming the Ukrainians with weapons and equipment to defend themselves from Russian attacks. We are using sanctions and export controls that are directly targeted at Russia's defense industry to undercut Russia's economic and military power to threaten and attack its neighbours.\"\n\nSo, the decision to end this Russia-Ukraine war lies with the West, US-NATO-EU. In this Russia-Ukraine war, Russia is the aggressor but the West US-NATO provoked Putin to the point of no return. This Russia-Ukraine war is the longest and most destructive since World War II creating a global crisis. This US-NATO Proxy War on Russia will continue through Ukraine. The objective of the West has throughout been to prolong the conflict for as long as possible and the same has been reflected in the recent Swiss Peace Initiative (15 and 16 June 2024) without Russian participation. Victory over Russia was a near impossible dream so now prolong the conflict for as long as possible. Everyone preaches that negotiations are the best shot for peace but where are they on ground for the Ukraine-Russia War including the Swiss Peace Initiative? Peace to end the war was nowhere on the agenda!\n\nG7 (Group of Seven: US, Italy, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, and Britain) major powers foreign ministers met on Capri Island, Italy on April 18, 2024, and pledged to bolster Ukraine's air defences and asked China to stop supporting Moscow's military industry if it wanted good relations with the West! The G7 Foreign minister acknowledged they had to do more to help Ukraine, which is struggling to hold off stronger Russian forces. Ukraine President Zelensky said that his country has \"A Chance at Victory\" over Russia with the new armaments package!\n\nThe West and the US has for decades been directly or indirectly involved in wars in other countries' by supporting proxy wars, inciting anti-government insurgencies, providing weapons and ammunition, and training anti-government forces, which have caused serious harm to the stability and security of the world. The West is aware of its initiated wars and expansionist power politics for two centuries.\n\nRecently a senior US politician and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham unabashedly stated in a media interview that Ukraine holds business value for the US. He claimed that there are \"10 to 12 trillion dollars of critical minerals\" in Ukraine, and the primary reason for supporting Ukraine is to seize these critical minerals by defeating Russia on the battlefield. Furthermore, he advocated for seizing and using frozen Russian assets in Europe and the US. (GlobalTimes).\n\nSuch remarks reveal the true intentions behind the US and NATO political elites' current policy toward the Ukraine crisis. \"Now you know why the West won't allow peace talks.\" The rest of the world may be keen to end the War, but the West's, US-NATO is only keen to prolong the conflict for as long as possible to weaken Russia as seen from various meetings over the years and Peace talks with a ceasefire to end the war is nowhere in the horizon. May be the likely leadership changes post elections in the US and France bring this war to an end? Donald Trump has repeatedly said he could settle the war between Russia and Ukraine in one day if he's elected president again. Russia's UN ambassador says he can't.\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who is an outspoken critic of Western military aid to Ukraine urged (02 July) Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to consider a ceasefire to accelerate an end to the war with Russia during his first trip to Kyiv in more than a decade. Orban said \"I asked the president to think about whether we could reverse the order, and speed up peace talks with a ceasefire first,\" Orban said.\n\nThere are no current negotiations between Ukraine and Russia and, based on public statements by Zelensky and Russian President Putin, the two sides appear as far apart as ever when it comes to the terms of a potential peace settlement. Unity between North America and its allies across the Atlantic Ocean is key as Europe faces a full-scale war and tensions rise around the globe, says outgoing NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. He had earlier told the Economist that alliance members should let Ukraine strike deep into Russia with Western weapons, a view supported by some European members of the transatlantic alliance but not the United States.\n\nIt's, therefore, the duty and responsibility of the UN and the West US-NATO to find ways to stop the Ukraine war. Under Article 24 of the UN Charter, the UN Security Council (UNSC) has\"primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.\" However, the UN has repeatedly failed in itsprimary responsibility. All wars end but wonder how will this war end with No Winners?",

Casualties included six media workers, 26 employees of healthcare institutions, five humanitarian workers, and 28 emergency service workers.\n\nIt added that the majority (91 per cent) of the casualties occurred in territory controlled by Ukraine, and nine per cent in Russian-occupied territory.\n\nIn the reporting period, Russian authorities reported that 91 civilians were killed and 455 injured in the Russia from attacks launched by Ukrainian armed forces, primarily in Belgorod, Briansk, and Kursk regions.\n\nPowerful weapons\n\nUN monitors identified the use of powerful air-dropped bombs and missiles in populated areas and at least five instances of successive attacks on the same location, just as first responders arrived on the scene, causing casualties.\n\nThe spring escalation in hostilities also saw Russian armed forces launch their \"largest campaign of attacks\" against critical energy infrastructure since the winter of 2022-23, killing and injuring civilians, while also affecting millions of people across the country with power cuts, the report said.\n\nRippling effects\n\nThe attacks also had rippling consequences on water supplies, mobile and internet access, and public transportation, Ms. Bell noted.\n\n\"The full impact of the attacks on energy infrastructure will only be clear this upcoming winter when the reduced power-generating capacity of Ukraine could leave many without access to heating and other services necessary for their survival,\" she said.\n\nAmong other findings, the report noted that the Russian armed forces pressured civilians in occupied territory to get Russian citizenship to receive medical services and keep their property rights.\n\nThe report will be presented to the Geneva-based Human Rights Council on 9 July.\n\nUN Assembly President visits Ukraine\n\nOn Wednesday, the President of the UN General Assembly completed a two-day official visit to Kyiv, where he met with several official leaders including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nIn his discussions Assembly President Dennis Francis stressed that the Russian aggression against Ukraine violated the UN Charter.\n\nHe reiterated the General Assembly's commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.\n\nMr. Francis also noted that the Organization has worked closely with the Government, local authorities and international partners to rebuild Ukraine from the destruction.\n\n\"I would like to think the darkest of the night is behind Ukraine, not ahead of it,\" he said, expressing hope that the recent Summit for Peace in Ukraine would bring further progress in the near future.\n\n/UN News Release.

        "title": "UAE and BRICS - the implications for illicit financial flows and extradition of the GuptasUAE and BRICS - implications for illicit financial flows and extradition of the Guptas",
        "body": "The Gupta extradition case ought to be among the key points of bilateral engagement between South Africa and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as a first step towards the advancement of meaningful dialogue and strong cooperation on combating illicit financial flows (IFFs).\n\nIn August 2023, the BRICS grouping - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - invited six other countries to join the alliance from 1 January 2024, paving the way to what is now casually referred to as BRICS+.\n\nThe invited countries were Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Argentina. However, Argentina's new president, Javier Milei, withdrew the country from joining BRICS after a review of decisions taken by the preceding government.\n\nThe expansion of the BRICS group undoubtedly presents new opportunities and challenges for both existing and new members. Much of the attention from political commentators and popular media has been centred around the economic profile of new members and the implications of an expanded BRICS on the US-led international order.\n\nThere is little attention towards detailed prospects for bilateral cooperation that BRICS expansion presents for both new and existing member states. As argued by Alice Pannier, strong bilateral cooperation is an important phase of engaging in international negotiations, as mutual interests are first developed on a bilateral level to build coalitions and more effectively highlight those interests in multilateral settings.\n\nThus, the strength, coherence, and unity of the BRICS+ grouping is dependent on the nature of relations that exist between individual BRICS+ member states.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, this piece narrows down the prospects thereof for bilateral cooperation of BRICS+ member states by giving special attention to South Africa/UAE relations. We seek to shed light on some of the areas in which South Africa should foster engagement with the UAE through the BRICS+ framework. We particularly pay special attention to illicit financial flows and the Gupta extradition case.\n\nOne of the immediate areas of engagement that BRICS expansion presents for South Africa and the UAE is on illicit financial flows (IFFs). IFFs as defined by the Internal Monetary Fund (IMF) are the \"movement of money across borders that is illegal in its source (e.g. corruption, smuggling), its transfer (e.g. tax evasion), or its use (e.g. terrorist financing)\".\n\nIFFs have significant adverse effects on the macroeconomies of countries where they originate, transit, and/or are integrated. According to the OECD, South Africa loses roughly between $3.5-billion and $5-billion to IFFs every year.\n\nThis estimate, which represents approximately 1-1.5% of South African annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP), is derived from estimates of between $40-billion and $54-billion in hidden South African-owned assets held in international financial centres (IFCs).\n\nThe country was listed in the 2022 Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) grey list (countries with high risks of IFFs) due to its failure to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. To this day, the country is still battling to get off the FATF list.\n\nThere is no doubt that IFFs deprive the country of the necessary financial resources needed to repay its debts and address internal socioeconomic challenges such as high levels of poverty, inequality, and unemployment, notwithstanding socioeconomic constraints posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the ongoing crisis in the Middle East.\n\nThe UAE is considered one of many enablers of global corruption, crime and IFFs. In 2022, the country was also grey-listed by both the FATF and the European Union (EU) amid risks associated with money laundering and terrorist financing relating to banks, precious metals and stones, as well as property. Matthew Page and Jodi Vittori argue that the UAE's prosperity is largely maintained by the relentless flow of illicit funds sourced from corruption and crime. The authors further argue that these proceeds have \"helped to fuel the emirate's booming real estate market; enrich its bankers, moneychangers, and business elites; and turn Dubai into a major gold trading hub\".\n\nSouth Africa and the UAE are party to the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC), which mandates that they cooperate with each other in ensuring that crimes related to corruption are prosecuted.\n\nIn 2018, the two countries also signed an extradition treaty that they both ratified in 2021. By definition, this meant that both states would be bound to deliver \"an accused or convicted person to the state where he is accused of, or has been convicted of, a crime by the state in which he is resident at the time\".\n\nHowever, in 2023, the UAE rejected South Africa's request to extradite Atul and Rajesh Gupta - State Capture-implicated brothers who fled South Africa while facing charges of money laundering and political corruption. This led to a diplomatic squabble between the two countries with South Africa's then Minister of Justice, Ronald Lamola, accusing the UAE of \"non-cooperation\", which he described as highly unprecedented in the arena of extradition requests.\n\nIt is crucial to highlight that the recent joint statement of the BRICS ministers of foreign affairs also reaffirms the group's commitment to \"promote BRICS cooperation in the prevention of and fight against corruption and continue to implement the relevant international agreements in this regard, in particular the United Nations Convention against Corruption\".\n\nTherefore, we believe that the BRICS+ forum creates an opportunity for dialogue and cooperation between South Africa and the UAE through the above-mentioned agreements and commitments.\n\nDespite the UAE's different view of South Africa's extradition request regarding the Gupta brothers, we believe that the spirit of dialogue and open communication reigns in BRICS. For instance, China and India are two BRICS countries whose border disputes and geopolitical tensions have received great attention from media and scholars.\n\nDespite their differences, there is no doubt that the BRICS+ forum has created room for dialogue and increased cooperation between the two countries. The most recent example is their bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the 15th BRICS Summit last year where both countries agreed to scale down tensions along their disputed border following another skirmish in late 2022. Even in the absence of the BRICS forums, the two counterparts have engaged in high-level meetings previously in a bid to put their differences aside.\n\nTherefore, the Gupta extradition case ought to be among the key points of bilateral engagement between South Africa and the UAE as a first step towards the advancement of meaningful dialogue and strong cooperation on combating IFFs.\n\nWhile many believe that tackling IFFs is a technical task that is too complicated, we argue that it is a matter of political will and strong international cooperation. This is proven by the African continent, which is leading the way in this effort - last year, an additional €1.69-billion was made in revenues through \"voluntary disclosures, information sharing mechanisms, and vigorous offshore investigation\".\n\nTherefore, such efforts and practices can be replicated by South Africa and the UAE through bilateral cooperation, and consequently championed within the overall BRICS+ grouping.

        "summary": "The article discusses the implications of the BRICS expansion for illicit financial flows (IFFs) and the extradition of the Gupta brothers, focusing on South Africa and the UAE. In August 2023, BRICS invited six new countries, including the UAE, to join from January 2024, forming BRICS+. This expansion offers opportunities for bilateral cooperation, particularly between South Africa and the UAE, to combat IFFs. Both countries face significant challenges with IFFs, which harm their economies. Despite an existing extradition treaty, the UAE rejected South Africa's request to extradite the Gupta brothers, leading to diplomatic tensions. The BRICS+ forum is seen as a platform to foster dialogue and cooperation on these issues. The authors argue that political will and international cooperation are crucial to addressing IFFs, citing successful efforts in Africa as a model.

        "body": "Kathmandu [Nepal], July 3 (ANI): After two days-long political drama, the incumbent government under Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal \"Prachanda\" has collapsed in Nepal as coalition ministers resign en-masse retracting support.\n\nWith the expiration of the 24-hour deadline given on Tuesday, the Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML), the key ally of the Dahal-led government walked out of the government. The party had given a one-day ultimatum to Prime Minister Dahal to step down from the post which it called \"a respectful exit.\"\n\nAlso Read | Pakistan: PTI Chief Imran Khan Seeks Permission From Rawalpindi Court To Meet His Sons, Qasim and Sulaiman, in Adiala Jail.\n\nOn Wednesday (July 3), eight ministers from CPN-UML on board the cabinet of Dahal formed on March 4 earlier this year, tendered resignations before the Prime Minister at his residence in Baluwatar. The ministers had reached Balkot, the residence of UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli and headed for Baluwatar.\n\n\"We have resigned and submitted the letter to the Prime Minister a while ago. All the 8 ministers on board the cabinet from the CPN-UML have resigned informing the Prime Minister that we no longer are part of this government and withdraw our support,\"\n\nAlso Read | Russia-Ukraine War: Russian Missiles and Drones Strike Dnipro in Daylight Attack, Killing at Least 5, Injuring 47.\n\nJwalakumari Sah, the former minister for Agriculture told ANI over phone call from PM residence, Baluwatar.\n\nThe UML and Congress on Monday night agreed to form a new government. Oli would lead a new national consensus and government for a year and a half. For the remaining term, Nepal's former PM Sher Bahadur Deuba will be the prime minister.\n\nDahal expressed reluctance to resign immediately. The office-bearers meeting of the CPN (Maoist Centre) held in Baluwatar on Tuesday had decided that the Prime Minister will not tender his resignation but instead face a trust vote in Parliament within 30 days since the retraction of support.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Nepali Congress formally endorsed the agreement reached with the CPN-UML on the formation of a new coalition. A central work execution committee meeting of the party held at party President Sher Bahadur Deuba's residence in Budhanilkantha endorsed the deal reached between the top leaders of the two largest parties.\n\nIn the deal, leaders from the two largest parties have reached an understanding to lead the governments in the remaining around three-and-half-year tenure of the present parliament on a rotation basis.\n\n\"The meeting concludes that it would be appropriate for the prime minister to pave the way for the formation of a new national consensus government as, following the agreement between Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, a clear majority in the House of Representatives is in favour of forming the government under the leadership of KP Sharma Oli,\" reads a statement issued after the meeting.\n\nThe meeting also expressed commitment to implement the agreement. \"The meeting expresses its determination to implement the agreement reached between the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML regarding leading governments on a rotation basis to protect national interests, control corruption, ensure good governance, the development, maintain political stability, amending the constitution to strengthen the federal democratic republican system and inclusiveness and to strengthen the economy.\"\n\nAs per the midnight agreement between Sher Bahadur Deuba from Nepali Congress and KP Sharma Oli from CPN-UML on Tuesday, a committee is also formed to suggest amendments to the election procedures and the constitution under the leadership of former Chief Justice Kalyan Shrestha.\n\nIn the overnight agreement, the largest and the second largest party in the parliament drafted a constitutional amendment agreement where it was stated that the Vice President would be made the chairman of the National Assembly. Leaders from the Congress and the UML informed President Ram Chandra Paudel about the change in coalition.\n\nDuring the meeting, the leaders informed the President about activating Section 76 (2) to form a new government in case the incumbent Prime Minister fails to win the vote of confidence after UML withdraws its support.\n\nPrachanda has to take the vote of confidence again from the parliament after a party withdraws support. Dahal, who came to power after the 2022 General Elections. has already taken the floor test in parliament for a record four times. (ANI)",

        "body": "NATO will roll out \"concrete ways\" to accelerate Ukraine's eventual membership in the Atlantic alliance during a summit next week in Washington, according to a senior U.S. official.\n\nSummit organizers are understood to be leaning toward language in a final declaration that would say Ukraine's path to NATO is \"irreversible,\" but the official would say only that the wording is still being negotiated.\n\nDouglas Jones, deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs, told VOA during an interview on Tuesday that foreign ministers from 35 non-NATO member partners are invited to attend the Washington summit.\n\nNotable attendees include the foreign ministers of Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nFor the third consecutive summit, heads of state from all 32 NATO allies will engage in discussions with leaders from its Indo-Pacific partners: Australia, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand.\n\nBuilding the resilience of allies to confront threats and challenges from China is among the key agenda items, said Jones. But, he added, a proposal to establish a NATO liaison office in Tokyo, intended as a hub for cooperation with Australia, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand, is currently \"not under active discussion.\"\n\nIn celebration of NATO's 75th anniversary, more than two dozen influencers have been invited to observe the proceedings and create social media content to commemorate the milestone.\n\nThe following excerpts from the interview have been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nVOA: Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban visited Kyiv on Tuesday and urged President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to consider a cease-fire with Russia. Are you concerned that this shows a divide in NATO? What is the U.S. perspective on Orban's visit to Ukraine?\n\nDouglas Jones, deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs: It's good that Prime Minister Orban visited Ukraine. On the idea of a cease-fire, these decisions are for Ukraine to make. We've always said, \"Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.\" It is up to Ukraine to decide when it's time to discuss a cease-fire and what the terms of any peace settlement might be.\n\nVOA: Moving on to NATO: What are the key items on the agenda? Are the foreign ministers of Israel and several Arab countries invited to the NATO summit?\n\nJones: We will be talking about the state of NATO. This summit is really about the future, about how NATO continues to transform and adapt itself to meet future challenges.\n\nWhether that's supporting Ukraine in its defense against Russian aggression, working with partners to build the resilience of allies to confront the threats and challenges from the People's Republic of China, or addressing hybrid and cyber threats, these are all issues that we'll be focusing on at the summit.\n\nNATO has a broad network of partnerships. There are 35 countries around the world that have a formal partnership relationship with NATO. They will all be invited at the level of foreign ministers to attend, including Israel and many countries in the Middle East.\n\nVOA: Zelenskyy is expected to attend next week's NATO summit. Does the U.S. view Ukraine's path to NATO membership as irreversible? Are the U.S. and its allies working to incorporate such language into NATO's joint statement?\n\nJones: The United States and all NATO allies have said that Ukraine's future is in NATO. At this summit, we will be rolling out concrete ways in which NATO can help Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression, build the future force needed to deter Russia, and implement the reforms it needs to make itself a stronger candidate for eventual NATO membership.\n\nTogether, this is what we describe as a bridge to NATO membership. The assistance that we're going to be rolling out at the summit will really help accelerate Ukraine on its path to NATO membership.\n\nVOA: And such a bridge is irreversible?\n\nJones: The wording of the declaration is still under negotiation by NATO allies. The alliance has already said that Ukraine will become a member of NATO.\n\nVOA: Regarding NATO's Indo-Pacific strategy, could you give us an update on the plan to open a NATO liaison office in Tokyo?\n\nJones: So, at the summit, the outcome with the Indo-Pacific partners is that all the heads of state and governments of NATO's Indo-Pacific partners -- Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand -- will be present. There are only three main meetings of the summit, and one of them will be when the heads of state of all 32 NATO allies meet with these Indo-Pacific partners. This is going to be the third summit in a row where this has happened.\n\nAnd the reason for that is because allies are increasingly recognizing that there are links between security in the Euro-Atlantic space and in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nUkraine is the No. 1 example where you have the biggest threat to transatlantic security, with Russia being fueled by assistance from China and the DPRK.\n\nVOA: Is there going to be a NATO office in Tokyo, or has such a plan been postponed indefinitely?\n\nJones: It's not under active discussion currently within the alliance.\n\nVOA: What can we expect from the NATO summit regarding the implications of the Russia-North Korea mutual defense pact?\n\nJones: Russia is seeking weapons from the DPRK as it looks for ways to continue its assault and aggression against Ukraine. The connections are deep. That's why we'll have the leaders of NATO's Indo-Pacific partners at the summit: to discuss how we can learn from each other and cooperate in addressing these common security challenges.",

        "body": "Released on Wednesday by the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU), the report explained the hardships civilians faced, including physical and long-term socioeconomic harm.\n\nIt also emphasised the human rights impact of Russia's renewed large-scale attacks on critical energy infrastructure in March, the ground offensive in the Kharkiv region in May and other developments in occupied and Government-controlled areas of Ukraine.\n\n\"With May having the highest monthly number of civilian casualties in nearly a year, fighting this spring took a horrific toll on civilians, particularly in Kharkiv region and city,\" said Danielle Bell, head of the HRMMU.\n\n\"The relentless attacks resulted in tragic loss of life, displacement, and destruction of homes and businesses,\" she added.\n\nAccording to the report, between 1 March and 31 May, at least 436 civilians were killed and a further 1,760 injured as a result of conflict-related violence. Casualties included six media workers, 26 employees of healthcare institutions, five humanitarian workers, and 28 emergency service workers.\n\nIt added that the majority (91 per cent) of the casualties occurred in territory controlled by Ukraine, and nine per cent in Russian-occupied territory.\n\nIn the reporting period, Russian authorities reported that 91 civilians were killed and 455 injured in the Russia from attacks launched by Ukrainian armed forces, primarily in Belgorod, Briansk, and Kursk regions.\n\nUN monitors identified the use of powerful air-dropped bombs and missiles in populated areas and at least five instances of successive attacks on the same location, just as first responders arrived on the scene, causing casualties.\n\nThe spring escalation in hostilities also saw Russian armed forces launch their \"largest campaign of attacks\" against critical energy infrastructure since the winter of 2022-23, killing and injuring civilians, while also affecting millions of people across the country with power cuts, the report said.\n\nThe attacks also had rippling consequences on water supplies, mobile and internet access, and public transportation, Ms. Bell noted.\n\n\"The full impact of the attacks on energy infrastructure will only be clear this upcoming winter when the reduced power-generating capacity of Ukraine could leave many without access to heating and other services necessary for their survival,\" she said.\n\nAmong other findings, the report noted that the Russian armed forces pressured civilians in occupied territory to get Russian citizenship to receive medical services and keep their property rights.\n\nThe report will be presented to the Geneva-based Human Rights Council on 9 July.\n\nOn Wednesday, the President of the UN General Assembly completed a two-day official visit to Kyiv, where he met with several official leaders including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nIn his discussions Assembly President Dennis Francis stressed that the Russian aggression against Ukraine violated the UN Charter.\n\nHe reiterated the General Assembly's commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.\n\nMr. Francis also noted that the Organization has worked closely with the Government, local authorities and international partners to rebuild Ukraine from the destruction.\n\n\"I would like to think the darkest of the night is behind Ukraine, not ahead of it,\" he said, expressing hope that the recent Summit for Peace in Ukraine would bring further progress in the near future.",

At least 436 civilians were killed and 1,760 injured during this period, with the majority of casualties occurring in Ukrainian-controlled areas. The report also noted the use of powerful bombs and missiles in populated areas and attacks on first responders. The destruction of energy infrastructure has had widespread effects on power, water, and communication services, with potential severe consequences for the upcoming winter. Additionally, Russian forces pressured civilians in occupied territories to obtain Russian citizenship for access to medical services and property rights. The report will be presented to the Human Rights Council on July 9. Concurrently, UN General Assembly President Dennis Francis visited Kyiv, reaffirming support for Ukraine's sovereignty and condemning Russian aggression."

        "title": "World News | Harris Tries to Hold the Line for Biden as Democrats Panic over Election | LatestLY",
        "body": "Washington, Jul 3 (AP) By the time Vice President Kamala Harris stepped into her third fundraiser since President Joe Biden's disastrous debate last week, she had her routine down.\n\nYes, she conceded to a few dozen donors in San Francisco, the president's performance was \"not his finest hour.\" However, she said, \"the outcome of this election cannot be determined by one day in June.\"\n\nAlso Read | Pakistan: PTI Chief Imran Khan Seeks Permission From Rawalpindi Court To Meet His Sons, Qasim and Sulaiman, in Adiala Jail.\n\nIt's not the kind of rhetorical two-step that any running mate would want to be practicing just over four months before the election, but Harris has little choice. She's trying to help Biden stave off a death spiral in their campaign for a second term after the 81-year-old president's faltering debate appearance magnified concerns about his ability to beat Donald Trump and serve another four years.\n\nThe moment could hardly be more delicate for the 59-year-old Harris, who is the first woman, Black person and person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president. Although some Democrats have pointed to her as a logical successor if Biden steps aside, others are drawing up wish lists of potential replacements that don't include her on the ticket at all.\n\nAlso Read | Russia-Ukraine War: Russian Missiles and Drones Strike Dnipro in Daylight Attack, Killing at Least 5, Injuring 47.\n\nDepending on how the coming days and weeks unfold, her work on Biden's behalf could lead to a political dead end, or secure her future within the party by providing fresh opportunities to prove her doubters wrong.\n\nChad Griffin, a member of the campaign's national finance committee, said the White House was fortunate to have a vice president that is \"tough as nails\" and \"out there defending the president and talking about the stakes of this election.\"\n\n\"They're a team,\" he said. \"And we're increasingly seeing the other half of that team.\"\n\nA wounded Biden appears to be pulling Harris closer. They were scheduled to have one of their occasional private lunches on Wednesday, and the vice president was belatedly added to the schedule for his Fourth of July celebration at the White House on Thursday.\n\nRisks and rewards as Harris elevated\n\nNone of this comes without political danger for Democrats. Harris' favorability ratings are low, and she's a frequent target for Republicans, who say she's waiting in the wings in case Biden isn't able to complete a second term. \"Vote Joe Biden today, get Kamala Harris tomorrow,\" said an advertisement from Trump's campaign.\n\nBut for now, Harris is Biden's top advocate as he faces calls to shake up his campaign or end his reelection effort. Her presence has been a balm for some anxious Democrats, such as the donors who gathered for a fundraiser in Los Angeles on Saturday.\n\nHarris paced the stage with a handheld mic -- Biden sometimes uses teleprompters even during fundraisers -- as she acknowledged \"the elephant in the room,\" meaning Thursday's debate. Then she swung her focus to Trump, who she described as a liar and a threat to democracy.\n\n\"You see how much hasn't changed?\" Harris said. \"So, let's deal with what we've got, right?\"\n\nGriffin said \"there was this sigh of relief\" from donors afterward. Some said \"we want to see more of that\" or \"the gloves are really off.\"\n\nOnly 39% of U.S. adults have a favorable view of Harris, which is in line with Biden's 40%, according to an AP-NORC poll conducted in June. However, her unfavorable rating is 49%, lower than Biden's 57%, and 12% said they weren't familiar enough with Harris to have an opinion of her.\n\nThe numbers mean there's risk and reward in spotlighting Harris, with room for public opinion to swing in either direction.\n\nNext in line for the presidency\n\nThere's no easy way for Democrats to force Biden to relinquish the nomination, which is scheduled to be finalized with a virtual vote before the party's convention in Chicago in August. There's also no precedent for a major party presidential candidate to drop out of the race at this point.\n\nBut if Biden steps aside, there's a wide array of Democrats who are primed for a shot at the White House, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nHowever, there are clear advantages for Harris. Under campaign finance rules, she could easily tap the money that's been raised for Biden's reelection. She also has hard-to-obtain foreign policy experience, after crisscrossing the globe on the White House's behalf and meeting with dozens of world leaders.\n\nSome have called for Democrats to nominate Harris or at least accept her as Biden's clear successor.\n\nFormer Rep. Tim Ryan, who fell short in his campaign for a Senate seat in Ohio, said that \"it's time\" for Harris to replace Biden on the ticket and provide \"generational change.\"\n\nRep. Jim Clyburn, an influential Democrat from the key primary state of South Carolina and a co-chair of Biden's campaign, said he would back Harris if the president wasn't in the race.\n\n\"This party should not, in any way, do anything to work around Ms. Harris,\" he told MSNBC. \"We should do everything we can to bolster her, whether it's in second place or at the top of the ticket.\"\n\nThe vice presidency can be a trap for ambitious politicians, and they're more likely to ascend to the presidency because of death than get elected on their own.\n\nOftentimes they're too closely tied to the current administration to represent a path forward, or voters are accustomed to seeing them as a sidekick rather than a leader, said Joel K. Goldstein, a vice presidential historian.\n\n\"The vice presidency is the best springboard,\" he said. \"But being vice president doesn't mean that you're going to automatically get the nomination, or going to get the nomination without an effort.\"\n\nDuring an interview with The Associated Press last year, Harris dismissed the idea of her replacing Biden as \"hypothetical,\" saying \"Joe Biden is going to be fine, so that is not going to come to fruition.\"\n\nHowever, she said every vice president has needed to be ready to step in if necessary.\n\nHarris and Biden advisers said the vice president's role hasn't shifted since the debate. She was already leading outreach to key demographic groups, such as Black people and young voters, and pushing for reproductive rights after the Supreme Court ended the nationwide right to abortion.\n\nHarris has also helped Biden fend off questions about his age before, such as when special counsel Robert Hur released his report on the president's handling of classified documents. Although Hur concluded that no criminal charges were warranted, he described Biden as a \"well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\"\n\nThe following day, Harris called Hur's report \"gratuitous, inaccurate and inappropriate.\"\n\nBut there's no question that the spotlight on Harris has brightened since the debate. A preview came on Thursday shortly after the debate ended.\n\nHer team had previously arranged for a series of television interviews, which is standard practice for big moments like the State of the Union. But as Biden faltered, it quickly became apparent that Harris would be the White House's first line of defense.\n\nShe conferred with Biden's braintrust, which was in Atlanta for the debate, and told them that she was going to say that the president had \"a slow start\" but a \"strong finish,\" according to a person with knowledge of the conversation.\n\nThat description was an understatement but one of the first concessions that Biden did poorly. Harris also helped set the tone for the campaign's response to the debate by attacking Trump as having \"lied over and over and over again\" and shifting the focus to Biden's overall record.\n\n\"I'm not gonna spend all night with you talking about the last 90 minutes when I've been watching the last 3.5 years of performance,\" she said.\n\nThe interviews drew some over-the-top praise from commentators who compared Harris' coherence with Biden's convoluted and sometimes nonsensical answers. That drew some eyerolls from Harris allies.\n\nThe vice president \"has been right under their nose,\" said Jamal Simmons, Harris' former communications director. \"This is who she is.\"\n\n\"People who are on Team Harris are very familiar with her being underestimated,\" he said.

Despite her low favorability ratings, Harris is actively defending Biden and addressing key issues, such as reproductive rights and outreach to key demographic groups. Her increased visibility and role in the campaign could either bolster her political future or lead to a dead end, depending on the outcome. Key figures supporting Harris include Chad Griffin and Rep. Jim Clyburn, while potential Democratic contenders include Governors Gavin Newsom, J.B. Pritzker, and Gretchen Whitmer. Harris' ability to navigate this period is crucial for her political trajectory and the Democratic Party's strategy."

The residents also raised the issue of inadequate compensation being granted to the people who had sold their lands for the proposed developmental projects.\n\nAlso Read | Pakistan: PTI Chief Imran Khan Seeks Permission From Rawalpindi Court To Meet His Sons, Qasim and Sulaiman, in Adiala Jail.\n\nThe locals have stated that the work has remained halted for at least a month and the locals have been facing severe problems relating to transportation and managing essentials for the Minapin area as the damaged roads and poor surrounding infrastructure cause travel-related problems for locals and tourists, Pamir Times reported.\n\nWhile raising his concerns over these issues, the local village head, Iqbal said, \"We had tried everything when we were demanding the redevelopment of this village and the surrounding areas. After several hardships, the administration finally agreed to redevelop our area.\"\n\nAlso Read | Russia-Ukraine War: Russian Missiles and Drones Strike Dnipro in Daylight Attack, Killing at Least 5, Injuring 47.\n\n\"In response, our local landowners sold their lands for mere pennies. Several shops were destroyed, several trees were cut and several local businesses were shifted, but now when it is the time to reap the fruits of their sacrifice, the administration has stopped the development work entirely. It has been over two months and we have requested all the authorities to respond but no one has responded.\"\n\nHe further said that residents have sacrificed their businesses, shops and lands for the betterment of the village. However, the people have received nothing in return.\n\nIqbal said, \"These local people who have lost their businesses, shops and lands for the betterment of the village what will they do now? And an addition to that is the government's slow speed in allocating compensation of lands, I have heard that this compensation was given to the district collector's office years ago but, I don't know why it has still not reached the right people.\"\n\nHe also mentioned that compensation for several other major highway projects like the Ghaizer Expressway, Navtar Expressway, and Chilas-Diame-Bhasha Dam had also been allotted to the authorities a long time ago. However, the work on the highway projects is not over yet and is causing a lot of problems for locals, both financially and logistically as the locals depend on tourism during the winter season which is just around the corner in Pakistan-occupied Gilgit Baltistan.\n\nExpressing concern over the condition of the tourism sector in the region, he said, \"The hotels that give us a major part of our income are empty because they are not able to reach our village and the Minapin Valley. We urge that the administration must act fast and keep their part of the bargain, as we have suffered a lot of loss when we gave our lands to the administration. But we will not take the damage this time, and will come out on the streets if our demands are not met.\" (ANI)\n\n(This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)",

        "title": "What Did Chinese Analysts Think of the Kim-Putin Summit in Pyongyang?",
        "body": "Commentators in China have very different takeaways from the Kim-Putin embrace in Pyongyang than their counterparts in the U.S.\n\nVoices from the United States, South Korea, and Japan claim Russian President Vladimir Putin's recent day-long state visit to North Korea has put Beijing in an awkward position. What did analysts from China think?\n\nOfficials in Beijing described the wide-ranging agreements between the two \"friendly and close neighbors\" as fulfilling the \"the legitimate need for exchanges, cooperation and development of relations.\" Scholars across China focused largely on Putin and Kim signing a long-awaited agreement on the construction of the Tumen River cross-border bridge - an issue that has largely gone unreported in the global media.\n\nThe only thing the U.S. and its allies on one hand and China on the other hand can agree upon is that Putin's visit to Pyongyang to revive the decades-long socialist brethren \"alliance\" between North Korea and Russia (and before that, the Soviet Union) was necessitated by Russia's geopolitical isolation and weakness - an outcome of the all-out Russian war on Ukraine. As the 28 months since February 2022 have shown, the invasion carries different significance for China, North Korea, and Russia, respectively. Yet the re-alliance between Moscow and Pyongyang is being viewed by many in China as beneficial to the great cause of opposing U.S. hegemony.\n\nWhat the U.S. Thinks China Thinks\n\nWithin hours of the signing of a new defense treaty between Russia and North Korea, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told his South Korean counterpart Cho Tae-yul by telephone that he condemned growing North Korea-Russia military cooperation. A couple of days later, Blinken's deputy, Kurt Campbell, said that Beijing was \"somewhat anxious\" over growing military cooperation between Russia and North Korea. \"I think it is fair to say that China is somewhat anxious about what's going on between Russia and North Korea. They have indicated so in some of our interactions, and we can see some tension associated with this,\" Campbell said in a keynote address at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nUnderstandably, there are specific reasons for the extraordinary Western attention on Putin's visit to North Korea and for the heightened concerns in the West regarding military cooperation between \"belligerent\" Russia and \"rogue\" North Korea. In China, on the contrary, Beijing has officially not reacted much - neither to express concerns nor to welcome the defense pact. The only official comment came from Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong, who said in a statement: \"As friendly neighbors, North Korea and Russia have normal needs for exchanges and relationship development, and their high-level engagement are bilateral arrangements between two sovereign states.\"\n\nInterestingly, it seems the central authorities in Beijing would rather have China's Russia experts and others belonging to the country's strategic community chip in and provide China's perspective.\n\nOf course, there are quite a few scholars who are apprehensive that Russia's \"go east\" policy might force Beijing to be watchful lest the growing Russian presence - not, it should be noted, the new defense treaty specifically - potentially cause \"instability\" in the situation in the Korean Peninsula. Yet analysts across China, affiliated with a wide spectrum of think tanks and university departments, have been mostly positive in their responses to Putin embracing North Korea, for three reasons: the perfect timing of Putin-Kim summit in Pyongyang; the opportunity for Beijing to improve relations with Brussels; and, most importantly, Putin keeping his word to Beijing by signing an agreement with Kim for early construction of cross-border highway bridge on the Tumen River.\n\n'Perfect' Timing of Putin-Kim Summit\n\nWhat is most interesting about Putin's sudden decision to visit North Korea, as noted in several Chinese commentaries, is that Moscow and Pyongyang started negotiating the specific date as recently as a week prior to the visit. This explains why most China watchers globally were literally caught sleeping as Vladimir Putin landed in the North Korean capital in the wee hours at 3 a.m. on Wednesday, June 19. This also means the Russian leader actually was in North Korea just for a day, and not a two-day visit as was mostly reported prior to the trip.\n\nWhy would Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un stay up until three in the morning to personally pick up a visiting foreign leader at the airport?\n\nBecause the foreign leader happened to be the Russian president, whom Kim had earlier hailed as \"invincible comrade-in-arms.\" The North Korean leader also maintains that his country's relationship with Putin-led Russia is at the highest point today, even comparable to the heyday of the alliance between North Korea and the former Soviet Union.\n\nHowever, if what commentators in China say is true, then Putin had decided to delay his arrival in Pyongyang - without telling Kim. Further, Chinese analysts believe Putin's decision was taken in order to avoid any adverse impact on the ongoing China-Japan-South Korea tripartite communication on the one hand and more importantly, from Beijing's point of view, a fresh round of Beijing-Seoul bilateral diplomatic and security dialogue taking place at the same time.\n\nA commentary on the popular digital platform sohu.com provided a full account of the supposed background of how Moscow worked out the specific dates of Putin's Pyongyang in consultation with Beijing. The commentary said that, both in order to avoid Kim and Putin sharing an \"embrace\" in Pyongyang on June 18 - the same day China and South Korea were to hold their first ever vice-ministerial security and diplomacy 2+2 meeting in Seoul - and to \"give face to Kim Jong Un,\" Putin made an unscheduled, over 5-hour stop in Yakutsk, the capital of Russia's Sakha Republic, for an inspection, taking photos and chatting with local people. As a result, he did not arrive in Pyongyang until three in the morning on June 19.\n\nThis delay also helped Beijing avoid explaining to Seoul why China was \"silent\" over the Russian involvement (along with North Korea) in endangering the security situation on the peninsula, as Putin didn't begin his visit until after the 2+2 had concluded.\n\nThe Pros and Cons of Putin's Visit to North Korea for China\n\nWhile the Russia-North Korea Treaty of Comprehensive Strategic Partnership signed between Putin and Kim last month is causing concern and drawing global attention - especially in the West and in Japan and in South Korea - the same treaty is being cited by most scholars and experts in China as the reason to welcome the increasing cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang. China's official Xinhua news agency hailed the treaty as the upgrading of Russia-North Korea relations in a commentary on June 22, and most scholarly accounts of the development have pointed out quite a few advantages for Beijing.\n\nFirst, Beijing sees the North Korea-Russia treaty as working to its benefit, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, as it is making the United States concerned or even frightened. Analysts approvingly called Russia and North Korea moving closer as a \"rational choice.\" Second, North Korea providing ammunition to Russia means that China can scale back certain trade with Russia and thereby improve China-EU relations, as European countries have repeatedly raised Chinese exports of dual-use goods to Russia as a major concern. Third, Chinese commentators claim that North Korea's mass export of ammunition to Russia could actually help improve stability on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nEchoing sentiments of many in China's strategic affairs community that the Kim-Putin summit was driven by the pressure and aggression of U.S. imperialism and its NATO allies, Wang Junsheng, a research fellow of East Asian studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, said this visit was sure to bring Russia-North Korea relations to new heights. \"Due to NATO's expansion in Europe and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the U.S.-led military alliances in Northeast Asia targeting Pyongyang, the deeper cooperation between Russia and North Korea is no surprise,\" Wang noted.\n\nSeveral Chinese scholars expressed the view that the long-standing strategy of the United States and its allies to isolate and suppress Russia and North Korea will automatically push them to work together to deal with the common threat from U.S.-led alliances, whether in Europe or Northeast Asia.\n\nAt another level, it has also been observed that although China, Russia, and North Korea are viewed as sharing a hostility to the U.S.-led international order, Beijing is not only aware but also very careful not to jeopardize the fact that it is less globally ostracized than the other two countries. Hence, as the sohu.com commentary already mentioned noted, North Korea-Russia rapprochement will help China balance or even improve relations with Europe on one hand, and on the other hand it will deplete North Korea's arsenal, which in turn will help Beijing's efforts to maintain peace and stability in Northeast Asia.\n\nThe Significance of a New Bridge on the Tumen River\n\nAs mentioned, in China, the signing of an agreement between Putin and Kim for early construction of a cross-border bridge across the Tumen River has been seen as more important news than the Russia-North Korea Comprehensive Strategic Partnership defense treaty. As noted in a Chinese commentary, this reflects Putin's current high attention to China's desires. Another Chinese commentary highlighted that \"when Putin visited China on May 16, he promised the Chinese leaders to talk to North Korea about the Tumen River estuary. This time he went to Pyongyang to discuss it. The two sides came up with a plan to build a new bridge.\"\n\nCurrently, the sole link between Russia and North Korea across the Tumen River is an old railway bridge, which is so small that it effectively blocks use of the river by commercial vessels.\n\nThe Kim-Putin agreement on building a new bridge over the Tumen River has been trending among the topmost issues on the largest Chinese social media platform, WeChat. However, skeptics have been less than hopeful of an early implementation of the agreement. The reasons, unsurprisingly, have a lot to do with China's colonial past and the \"century of humiliation.\" Historically speaking, the area in China's northeast bordering Russia, North Korea, and the Sea of Japan, had fallen into the hands of Imperial Russia following the Treaty of Peking after the occupation of Beijing by French and British troops in 1860. Today, a sliver of Russian territory separates China from the Sea of Japan - and gives Russia a direct land border with North Korea, marked by the Tumen River.\n\nThe region was deadlocked in China-USSR hostility following the Sino-Soviet split. In the post-Soviet era, both North Korea and Russia remained wary of Chinese hegemony and \"expansionism.\" But following Chinese market reform and opening up policies, Beijing has been relentlessly pushing for access to the Tumen River and through it to the Sea of Japan. Backed by Russia, Japan, the two Koreas and Mongolia, in 1991 and in 1995, China successfully rallied the United Nations Development Program, leading to the establishment of Tumen River Regional Development Plan (TRRDP) and Tumen River Area Development Program (TRADP), respectively. However, due to internal frictions in Russia and Japanese and South Korean suspicions about the role of North Korea, the TRADP project never really took off.\n\nMore recently, China-North Korea announced in 2014 the construction of a new bridge in the Tumen River basin connecting Hunchun in China to Sonbong-guyok in North Korea will be completed by the end of 2015. Work was still ongoing in 2019, before North Korea shut its borders and all related infrastructure projects, amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAs observed in Japan's Nikkei Asia, factors such as the \"new Cold War,\" Pyongyang's ever-increasing appetite for nuclear weapons, growing friction between the two Koreas, and Japanese \"insecurity\" vis-à-vis fast expanding Chinese military might all served as obstacles in China's long cherished desire to access the Sea of Japan through the Russia-North Korea river border.\n\nScholars in China might have been excited with the Tumen River cross-border bridge agreement in Pyongyang, but they are unable to forget the disillusionment that has accumulated over the past several decades. Agreement after agreement has been quietly ignored, preventing China from fulfilling its wish to connect China's northeast to Rajin in North Korea and hence access the Sea of Japan - which is a mere 15 kilometers past the Soviet-era bridge that currently blocks the river. Chinese analysts are thus closely watching North Korea-Russia relations for its potential to achieve three of China's goals: improve relations with Europe, deplete North Korea's arsenal, and bring about the long-awaited construction of a cross-border bridge across the Tumen River.",

        "summary": "The recent summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang has elicited varied reactions from Chinese analysts compared to their Western counterparts.

The summit's timing was strategically planned to avoid clashing with China-South Korea diplomatic meetings. The new Russia-North Korea defense treaty is seen as advantageous for China, potentially improving stability on the Korean Peninsula and allowing China to scale back certain trade with Russia, thereby improving relations with Europe.\n\nThe Tumen River bridge agreement is particularly significant for China, reflecting Putin's attention to Chinese interests. However, there is skepticism about the project's early implementation due to historical and geopolitical challenges. Chinese analysts are closely monitoring the Russia-North Korea relationship for its potential to achieve China's goals of improving relations with Europe, depleting North Korea's arsenal, and constructing the long-awaited bridge."

        "title": "MIL-OSI Global: Ukraine war: Kyiv rejects Orbán ceasefire plan but global security deals offer...",
        "body": "Source: The Conversation - UK - By Stefan Wolff, Professor of International Security, University of Birmingham\n\nUkraine has firmly ruled out any compromises in its war with Russia, according to a senior aide to President Volodymyr Zelensky. Andriy Yermak, the Ukrainian president's chief of staff, said that while Kyiv welcomed advice on how to reach a \"just peace\", Ukraine is \"not ready to go to the compromise for the very important things and values ... independence, freedom, democracy, territorial integrity, sovereignty\".\n\nYermak's comments came a day after Viktor Orbán, the Hungarian prime minister suggested that Kyiv should agree a ceasefire with Moscow. Orbán, who is known to be close to Vladimir Putin and who has just taken over the rotating presidency of the European Council, raised the idea during his first wartime visit to Kyiv on July 2.\n\nOrbán has been the most sceptical of the EU leaders when it comes to European financial and military support for Ukraine. He was instrumental in delaying the agreement of a €50 billion (£42 billion) aid package for several months earlier this year.\n\nBut, despite Orbán's reticence, the EU recently agreed a bilaterial security pact with Zelensky while he visited Brussels on June 27. Under the terms of the deal, \"the European Union and its\n\nMember States will contribute, for the long term and together with partners, to security commitments to Ukraine, which will help Ukraine to defend itself, resist destabilisation efforts and deter acts of aggression in the future\".\n\nThe EU deal is the latest of 20 such bilateral agreements, including with the US and major European powers. But while they represent a show of support for Ukraine, they fall short of providing actual security guarantees. None of Kyiv's partners are willing to deploy troops for the country's defence, primarily because this is seen as a pathway to escalation into a full-scale confrontation between Russia and Nato.\n\nSo none of these security agreements are therefore likely to deter Putin in his war of aggression. But they are far from ineffective or useless. They provide ten-year commitments to train and equip Ukraine's armed forces, to strengthen the country's defence industrial base and to contribute to its economic recovery.\n\nAt the same time, they reiterate the need for Russian leaders to be held accountable and for sanctions against Moscow to be maintained, and if necessary extended. All of this sends a clear signal that Ukraine's western partners are serious about their support.\n\nBeyond the symbolism of the sheer number of agreements, they have also had positive practical consequences for Ukraine. Kyiv's ground offensive last year may have failed to liberate much territory, but Ukraine's forces have decimated the Russian Black Sea fleet. It has had to relocate from its traditional base in Sevastopol to sites on the Russian mainland.\n\nThis has decreased the risk of any seaborne landing by Russian forces on Ukraine's Black Sea coast and has allowed Kyiv to establish a secure maritime trade corridor in the western Black Sea to enable its agricultural exports.\n\nSimilarly, Ukrainian drones have been able to reach deeper and deeper into Russian territory and attack military bases, supply routes and energy infrastructure there.\n\nTogether with fewer restrictions on the use of advanced military systems against Russian territory, Ukraine has gradually improved its position on the ground.\n\nThis can, and should, not detract from the fact that Russia has made gains in the land war and continues to do so while also targeting Ukraine's critical national infrastructure. But it does indicate that for as long as western support is forthcoming, it is unlikely that Putin's aggression will succeed.\n\nBut, for all its heroism in the field, Ukraine is very far from establishing a clear pathway to victory. Russias' economy remains resilient, Moscow continues to mobilise more troops than Kyiv, and its alliances with Iran, North Korea, and China are giving it valuable economic, military and diplomatic cover.\n\nIt is not clear how long Russia can maintain this position of at least relative strength. But neither is it clear that Ukraine's situation will continue to improve.\n\nA return of Donald Trump to the White House after the US presidential elections in November 2024 - at present looking increasingly likely - would bring with it a resurgence of Trump's so-called \"America-first\" foreign policy. The US would then probably try to force Ukraine - and its other western partners - to accept Russian terms in a negotiated settlement.\n\nWithout any real, hard security guarantees for Ukraine in such a settlement, Kyiv would find itself back where it was a decade ago. Faced with Russian occupation of Crimea and large chunks of eastern Ukraine - and with lukewarm support from the west - it had to rely on a worthless \"agreement\" with Russia and no assurances against further Russian aggression.\n\nBut this isn't a foregone conclusion, whatever the outcomes of November's presidential election. On the contrary, the multiple security agreements that Ukraine has signed over the past few months also make an alternative future conceivable.\n\nIt's a future in which, with western help, Kyiv can demonstrate the futility of Russian aggression by regaining more territory and provide more effective air defences for its population and infrastructure. Western military aid, and the permission to strike at Russian military bases will help disrupt the supply lines that have enabled Russia's battlefield victories.\n\nIn this case, Putin is unlikely to look like the kind of winner that Trump likes to back. This calculation creates a window of opportunity for Ukraine's western partners over the next six or so months to double down on, and accelerate, their support for Kyiv and future-proof what ultimately might turn out a winning strategy in a war of attrition after all.\n\nStefan Wolff is a past recipient of grant funding from the Natural Environment Research Council of the UK, the United States Institute of Peace, the Economic and Social Research Council of the UK, the British Academy, the NATO Science for Peace Programme, the EU Framework Programmes 6 and 7 and Horizon 2020, as well as the EU's Jean Monnet Programme.

In addition, the call of CPJ to the Public Security Department of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region regarding the safety of the journalists had also gone unanswered.\n\nPreviously, CPJ in a report released in 2023 found out that China remains the worst place when it comes to arresting journalists, especially from ethnic minorities.\n\nAccording to CPJ's latest annual prison census, with at least 44 behind bars as of December 1, 2023.

CPJ has not received information on the charges but suspects Koben's arrest may be linked to his work on historic buildings in Xinjiang. CPJ's China representative, Iris Hsu, urged Chinese authorities to stop harassing and detaining journalists from Muslim ethnic minorities. CPJ's 2023 report highlights China as the worst country for journalist arrests, particularly targeting ethnic minorities like Uyghurs. International bodies have accused China of severe human rights violations and genocide in Xinjiang."

        "title": "Russia Freaked: The U.S. Navy Surfaced a Seawolf-Class Submarine as a",
        "body": "Summary and Key Points: The U.S. Navy's Seawolf-class submarines, developed at the end of the Cold War, were designed to counter Soviet threats. Despite budget constraints limiting the fleet to three vessels, these submarines boast sophisticated undersea warfare technology.\n\n-The Navy has used public displays of the Seawolf-class, such as surfacing in Norway in 2020, to deter Russian aggression. The class includes USS Seawolf, USS Connecticut, and USS Jimmy Carter, each with unique capabilities.\n\n-These submarines are armed with advanced torpedoes and missiles, and could potentially be showcased in the future to deter further hostilities from adversaries.\n\nDesigned at the tail end of the Cold War, the U.S. Navy's Seawolf-class submarines were built to surpass the capabilities of their Soviet counterparts.\n\nWhile budgetary constraints and the collapse of the USSR led to the cancellation of the full planned fleet of vessels, the three Seawolf ships constructed continue to wow naval experts and scare U.S. adversaries. In fact, the Navy's Seawolf ships carry some of the most sophisticated undersea warfare technology ever developed.\n\nAlthough submarines usually remain silent and stealthy, in order to demonstrate their ability to strike from any corner of the world, the Navy has intentionally surfaced them as a show of force to adversaries.\n\nIn 2020, the service made public displays of its nuclear submarines in Norway in an effort to deter Russian hostility in the region. On Aug. 21, 2020, USS Seawolf parked off the coast of Tromso to take on new crew members. The U.S. and Norway use this strategic port off the coast of Tromso to keep an eye on Moscow's Northern Fleet. According to senior naval officials, \"the U.S. and Norway have a great relationship, and our ability to use facilities in and around Tromso would provide a strategic location for our visits,\" adding that \"It would give us flexibility for not only the U.S. but allied countries to exercise in the High North.\"\n\nUSS Seawolf, like its two sister ships, was developed in the late Cold War. The Navy required a new sub class capable of countering the USSR's Typhoon class of ballistic missile submarines. Engineers designed the Seawolf ships to be quieter and faster than their predecessors. The lead ship of the class, USS Seawolf, was ordered in 1989 from the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics. USS Connecticut was commissioned a decade later, followed by USS Jimmy Carter in 2004.\n\nIn 2021, Connecticut was severely damaged after colliding with a seamount while sailing in the South China Sea. Fortunately, no sailors were killed in the incident, but the submarine has remained out of commission since this mishap. The Navy expects to return Connecticut to service in 2025.\n\nUSS Jimmy Carter was developed with distinct modifications, making the submarine essentially a new class when compared to its two sister ships. The Navy uniquely designed Jimmy Carter for covert surveillance and special operations missions.\n\nAccording to Business Insider, Jimmy Carter included \"special thrusters fore and aft that allow the sub to remain stationary underwater, as well as a 100-ft hull extension known as the Multi-Mission Platform, which increased its length to 435 feet and its fully submerged displacement 12,158 tons.\" Jimmy Carter can float above undersea communications cables and physically cut into them, which enables the submarine to intercept the data streams running through them.\n\nThe Navy's Seawolf-class ships are typically armed with 533mm Mark 48 torpedoes, in addition to Harpoon anti-ship missiles and Tomahawk cruise missiles. A Tercom-Aided Inertial Navigation System guides each missile toward its intended target. While the Tomahawk can be fitted with a nuclear warhead, these submarines rarely carry these types of munitions.\n\nAs detailed by Naval Technology, \"Block III improvements include an improved propulsion system and Navstar global positioning system (GPS) guidance capability. The anti-ship Tomahawk missile is equipped with inertial guidance and an active radar and anti-radiation homing head. The range is up to 450km.\"\n\nAs Russia's invasion of Ukraine rages on, the U.S. and its NATO allies are constantly working to deter additional hostilities in the region. Showcasing the strength and capability of the U.S. submarine fleet via surprise surfacing missions could remind the Kremlin of the consequences of extending the war further.",

        "title": "Ukraine war: Kyiv rejects Orbán ceasefire plan but global security deals offer hope",
        "body": "University of Birmingham provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation UK.\n\nUkraine has firmly ruled out any compromises in its war with Russia, according to a senior aide to President Volodymyr Zelensky. Andriy Yermak, the Ukrainian president's chief of staff, said that while Kyiv welcomed advice on how to reach a \"just peace\", Ukraine is \"not ready to go to the compromise for the very important things and values ... independence, freedom, democracy, territorial integrity, sovereignty\".\n\nYermak's comments came a day after Viktor Orbán, the Hungarian prime minister suggested that Kyiv should agree a ceasefire with Moscow. Orbán, who is known to be close to Vladimir Putin and who has just taken over the rotating presidency of the European Council, raised the idea during his first wartime visit to Kyiv on July 2.\n\nOrbán has been the most sceptical of the EU leaders when it comes to European financial and military support for Ukraine. He was instrumental in delaying the agreement of a €50 billion (£42 billion) aid package for several months earlier this year.\n\nBut, despite Orbán's reticence, the EU recently agreed a bilaterial security pact with Zelensky while he visited Brussels on June 27. Under the terms of the deal, \"the European Union and its Member States will contribute, for the long term and together with partners, to security commitments to Ukraine, which will help Ukraine to defend itself, resist destabilisation efforts and deter acts of aggression in the future\".\n\nThe EU deal is the latest of 20 such bilateral agreements, including with the US and major European powers. But while they represent a show of support for Ukraine, they fall short of providing actual security guarantees. None of Kyiv's partners are willing to deploy troops for the country's defence, primarily because this is seen as a pathway to escalation into a full-scale confrontation between Russia and Nato.\n\nSo none of these security agreements are therefore likely to deter Putin in his war of aggression. But they are far from ineffective or useless. They provide ten-year commitments to train and equip Ukraine's armed forces, to strengthen the country's defence industrial base and to contribute to its economic recovery.\n\nAt the same time, they reiterate the need for Russian leaders to be held accountable and for sanctions against Moscow to be maintained, and if necessary extended. All of this sends a clear signal that Ukraine's western partners are serious about their support.\n\nBeyond the symbolism of the sheer number of agreements, they have also had positive practical consequences for Ukraine. Kyiv's ground offensive last year may have failed to liberate much territory, but Ukraine's forces have decimated the Russian Black Sea fleet. It has had to relocate from its traditional base in Sevastopol to sites on the Russian mainland.\n\nThis has decreased the risk of any seaborne landing by Russian forces on Ukraine's Black Sea coast and has allowed Kyiv to establish a secure maritime trade corridor in the western Black Sea to enable its agricultural exports.\n\nSimilarly, Ukrainian drones have been able to reach deeper and deeper into Russian territory and attack military bases, supply routes and energy infrastructure there.\n\nTogether with fewer restrictions on the use of advanced military systems against Russian territory, Ukraine has gradually improved its position on the ground.\n\nThis can, and should, not detract from the fact that Russia has made gains in the land war and continues to do so while also targeting Ukraine's critical national infrastructure. But it does indicate that for as long as western support is forthcoming, it is unlikely that Putin's aggression will succeed.\n\nAll eyes on Washington\n\nBut, for all its heroism in the field, Ukraine is very far from establishing a clear pathway to victory. Russias' economy remains resilient, Moscow continues to mobilise more troops than Kyiv, and its alliances with Iran, North Korea, and China are giving it valuable economic, military and diplomatic cover.\n\nIt is not clear how long Russia can maintain this position of at least relative strength. But neither is it clear that Ukraine's situation will continue to improve.\n\nA return of Donald Trump to the White House after the US presidential elections in November 2024 - at present looking increasingly likely - would bring with it a resurgence of Trump's so-called \"America-first\" foreign policy. The US would then probably try to force Ukraine - and its other western partners - to accept Russian terms in a negotiated settlement.\n\nWithout any real, hard security guarantees for Ukraine in such a settlement, Kyiv would find itself back where it was a decade ago. Faced with Russian occupation of Crimea and large chunks of eastern Ukraine - and with lukewarm support from the west - it had to rely on a worthless \"agreement\" with Russia and no assurances against further Russian aggression.\n\nBut this isn't a foregone conclusion, whatever the outcomes of November's presidential election. On the contrary, the multiple security agreements that Ukraine has signed over the past few months also make an alternative future conceivable.\n\nIt's a future in which, with western help, Kyiv can demonstrate the futility of Russian aggression by regaining more territory and provide more effective air defences for its population and infrastructure. Western military aid, and the permission to strike at Russian military bases will help disrupt the supply lines that have enabled Russia's battlefield victories.\n\nIn this case, Putin is unlikely to look like the kind of winner that Trump likes to back. This calculation creates a window of opportunity for Ukraine's western partners over the next six or so months to double down on, and accelerate, their support for Kyiv and future-proof what ultimately might turn out a winning strategy in a war of attrition after all.",

        "title": "Ukraine war: Russia toughens up draft law to round-up more people for the frontlines",
        "body": "Aberystwyth University provides funding as a member of The Conversation UK.\n\nRussia is introducing laws aimed at closing loopholes used by those wanting to avoid the draft.\n\nEvading the draft has been relatively easy in Russia until now. All those who wanted to avoid military service needed to do was avoid receiving a paper draft notice.\n\nOne option was to move without letting the authorities know a current address, so that it couldn't be delivered. This new legislation closes that loophole as the draft notice will be considered served a week after it has been posted online on a government website.\n\nThe failure of the Russian government to share conscription data with border-crossing posts had also been an issue during the 2022 \"partial\" military mobilisation. This emergency mobilisation drafted 300,000 soldiers to be sent to Ukraine to counteract Russia's losses on the battlefield.\n\nBut Moscow was not able to stop young people who feared being drafted leaving in large numbers. Some sources reported 700,000 people leaving in September 2022 alone. But with the war in Ukraine continuing Moscow intends to stop this exodus from happening again.\n\nWhat changes?\n\nFrom November 1 2024, draft notices will also be collated along with other information that the government holds on its citizens, such as tax details, criminal charges or property, so officials can keep a complete profile of that person and what they do, and track their movements more closely.\n\nThe most notable change is, however, how draft notices will be served. They will no longer rely on a paper form being delivered to a physical address. From November these will be filed online and will be considered as delivered even if recipients do not have access to the internet or have not seen the notice.\n\nThis legal change is likely to affect the second conscription campaign of the year, known in Russia as the autumn draft (osennij prizyv). As the war in Ukraine shows no signs of ending, the huge numbers of people escaping the draft has presented a significant challenge for Moscow. Some estimates put Russia's losses at almost 900 soldiers a day, with the total quickly approaching half a million lives lost, according to UK government estimates.\n\nGiven this, Moscow is determined to increase conscription numbers, and stem the flow of those leaving over its borders to avoid being drafted. Those eligible for the draft are typically men between the ages 18 to 27, except for a few specific circumstances when women in certain professions (doctors, radio and map specialists) can be drafted. (Although the upper age for conscription could be raised to 30 at some point.)\n\nOnce the changes have been brought in, border forces will be able to access all of this online information, giving them the power to quickly check if people should be allowed to leave Russia. People who have had a draft notice issued online will be banned from crossing any border.\n\nA wave of departures?\n\nThese imminent changes have the potential to prompt a new charge to the border this summer, before the new law is implented in November.\n\nThe new system also has potential to allow the Russian government to track its citizens more carefully using this new database. This would make it harder for those attempting to evade the draft to maintain an online presence, have a bank account, or own a car, without the government catching up with them.\n\nAnyone who wants to leave, or dodge the draft, will have to come up with more elaborate ways of evasion than those they might have been used in the past.\n\nRussians might consider the Soviet-style draft evasion approach, when corruption within local authorities and medical institutions allowed people to buy fake disability certificates and other \"official\" documents that meant they could avoid being conscripted. Corruption in the Russian military is endemic, so new avenues like these may quickly open up.\n\nThese changes indicate that Moscow could be preparing for a prolonged conflict in Ukraine, despite recent discussions about resuming peace talks. Vladimir Putin has said that Russia is ready to stop the war if Ukraine agrees to the Kremlin's terms. However, the preparation for the 2024 autumn conscription campaign might indicate that this is not the primary plan, as Moscow continues to make, and adapt, its military planning.",

He is now a recruit of the Russian Freedom Legion with the call sign \"Goga\".\n\nThis was reported by the representative of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Andrii Yusov and \"Goga\" himself at a press conference, an OBOZ.UA correspondent reports. According to Yusov, the destruction of the Serpukhov was part of Operation \"Rybalka\", which has been ongoing since 2023.\n\nAs a result of this operation, a large amount of important information was obtained and the \"Serpukhov\" ship was put out of commission for at least six months.\n\nA sailor of the Russian Baltic Fleet, who had served in the Russian Federation for 11 years in 2022 questioned the adequacy of the Russian authorities when the aggressor country attacked Ukraine, and helped to carry out the operation.\n\nAt first, he tried to find like-minded people on his ship, but a case was opened against him and the sailor had to communicate with the Russian prosecutor's office.\n\nIn 2023, \"Goga\" turned to the \"I Want to Live\" project, which coordinated him with the Legion. That's how the man became a saboteur and collaborated with Ukrainian intelligence.\n\nHe supplied classified information to the intelligence community until April 2024. That month, the Russian command decided to involve the crews of the Baltic Fleet in the war in Ukraine.\n\nTo avoid the Goga's participation in the war on the side of the Russian Federation, it was decided to transfer it to the territory of Ukraine. Before doing so, he sabotaged and set fire to the \"Serpukhov\" ship on which he was serving.\n\nIn addition, \"Goga\" passed classified information about the Baltic Fleet and the Russian military-industrial complex to the DIU.\n\nIt is known that the man is an ethnic Ukrainian and comes from a military family.\n\nAs a reminder, the Freedom of Russia Legion is a Russian legion within the International Legion of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, formed in March 2022 to defend Ukraine from Russian aggression. It consists of former military personnel of the Russian Armed Forces and other Russians, as well as Belarusians who sided with Ukraine.\n\nAs reported by OBOZ.UA, the \"Serpukhov\" missile ship was on fire in the Kaliningrad region of the Russian Federation on April 7, 2024. The ship was stationed at the occupiers' Baltiysk naval base. The \"Serpukhov\" was seriously damaged and sent for repair.\n\nOBOZ.UA's sources reported that the incident with the Russian ship was a special operation of the DIU.\n\nIt should be noted that on the same day, the Russian \"Catherine the Great\", the world's only ice-class supply ship, was on fire in Vladivostok, Russia. Moscow reported one dead and three injured.",

        "title": "Supreme Court's Broad Immunity Ruling May Empower Trump's Comeback",
        "body": "WASHINGTON -- In her dissent from a Supreme Court opinion that afforded former President Donald Trump broad immunity, Justice Sonia Sotomayor pondered the potential doomsday consequences: A president could pocket a bribe for a pardon, stage a military coup to retain power, order the killing of a rival by the Navy SEAL Team Six -- and be protected from prosecution for all of it.\n\nThe scenarios may sound part of an apocalyptic future. But the plain reality of the 6-3 opinion is that it ensures presidents have a wide berth to carry out official acts without fear of being criminally charged and it could embolden Trump, who was impeached twice and faced four separate prosecutions over the last year and a half, as he eyes a return to the White House.\n\nThe outcome is significant because Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has been public about wanting to pursue the same boundary-obliterating conduct that defined his four years in office, spawned criminal and congressional investigations and raised thorny questions about the scope of presidential immunity that were resolved largely in his favor in Monday's landmark opinion.\n\nRelated Story: Trump Says He Can End the Russia-Ukraine War in One Day. Russia's UN ...\n\n\"Over the long term, I think it will broaden what presidents are willing to do because they will see that there's a gray zone that the Supreme Court laid out,\" said Princeton University professor Julian Zelizer, who studies political history. The effect of the opinion, he said, will be to \"broaden the scope of what's going to be permissible\" and give presidents sufficient cover for acts that may veer into criminality.\n\nThe opinion authored by Chief Justice John Roberts did not dismiss the case charging Trump with plotting to overturn the 2020 presidential race, as Trump had desired, and it left intact the long-established principle that there's no immunity for purely personal acts. However, it significantly narrowed the case by finding that presidents enjoy absolute immunity for their core constitutional duties and are entitled to the presumption of immunity for other official acts.\n\n\"This is a full-throated endorsement of the unitary executive theory\" in a dramatic way, said Cornell University law professor Michael Dorf, referring to the theory that the U.S. Constitution vests extraordinary power in the presidency.\n\nFrom a practical perspective, the court's opinion means that the trial judge, Tanya Chutkan, must now engage in further fact-finding analysis to determine how much of the conduct alleged in the indictment from special counsel Jack Smith can remain part of the case.\n\nRelated Story: Manhattan Prosecutors Agree to Delay Trump's Sentencing\n\nImportantly for Trump, the one area the conservative majority said was unquestionably off-limits for prosecutors was his command of the Justice Department. That includes his directives to department leadership after the 2020 election to conduct what prosecutors said were \"sham\" investigations into bogus claims of election fraud, as well as his attempts to use the department's authority to advance his fruitless efforts to remain in power.\n\nThough the opinion doesn't make new law about the interplay between the White House and the Justice Department, Roberts affirmed that a president has \"exclusive authority over the investigative and prosecutorial functions of the Justice Department and its officials\" and may also \"discuss potential investigations and prosecutions with his Attorney General and other Justice Department officials to carry out his constitutional duty to 'take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.'\"\n\n\"I do think that this is a norm-breaking opinion and I can imagine Trump using this as a basis for a complete destruction of DOJ independence,\" said Boston College law professor Kent Greenfield.\n\nThe position from the nation's highest court is welcome news for Trump, particularly as he and his allies have suggested wanting to use the power of the presidency -- including, presumably, the investigative authority of the Justice Department -- to pursue retribution against political enemies.\n\nAfter his May conviction in his New York hush money case, Trump suggested he might try to retaliate against Hillary Clinton, his 2016 opponent, if he returns to the White House.\n\n\"Wouldn't it be terrible to throw the president's wife and the former secretary of state, think of it, the former secretary of state, but the president's wife, into jail? Wouldn't that be a terrible thing? But they want to do it,\" Trump said in an interview on Newsmax. \"It's a terrible, terrible path that they're leading us to. And it's very possible that it's going to have to happen to them.\"\n\nMore recently, he reposted a meme that suggested that former congresswoman Liz Cheney, who as the No. 3 Republican in the House broke ranks with her party and voted to impeach Trump over the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol, had committed treason and should face a military tribunal.\n\nRelated Story: How to Get Voters the Facts They Need Without a Trump Jan. 6 Trial\n\nThe posts and comments raise concerns given how Trump's interactions with the FBI and Justice Department as president shattered longstanding norms and became central to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into whether he had obstructed an inquiry into potential Russia coordination with his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nTrump urged his FBI director, James Comey, to an investigation into a close ally and fired him weeks later, berated his hand-picked attorney general, Jeff Sessions, for having recused himself from the Russia investigation and also sought the termination of Mueller.\n\nIn his report, Mueller did not conclude whether Trump had illegally obstructed the investigation, in part, because of a Justice Department legal opinion that says sitting presidents cannot be indicted. But he did say that presidents were not \"categorically and permanently\" immunized for obstructing justice by using their presidential power.\n\nTo be sure, there are safeguards still in place that could prevent most presidents from testing the limits of criminal immunity.\n\nThe threat of impeachment by Congress remains -- Trump was impeached over a call with Ukraine's leader and Jan. 6, but acquitted by the Senate -- as do the practices, protocols and norms that govern Washington bureaucracy.\n\nRoberts, for one, sought in his majority opinion to downplay the impact, saying Sotomayor was striking \"a tone of chilling doom that is wholly disproportionate to what the Court actually does today.\"\n\nBut even if the scope of presidential power is not directly expanded by the opinion, there's no question that it could benefit any president determined to abuse those powers.\n\n\"Not every president will take advantage, but the lesson, I think, of Donald Trump is: one might,\" Zelizer said. \"Or the lesson of Richard Nixon is: one might. And the 'one mights' are the lessons that you're looking for.\"",

        "title": "Passenger Demand Up 10.7% in May",
        "body": "The International Air Transport Association (IATA) released data for May 2024 global passenger demand with the following highlights:\n\n\"Strong demand for travel continues with airlines posting a 10.7% year-on-year increase in travel for May. Airlines filled 83.4% of their seats, a record for the month. With May ticket sales for early peak- season travel up nearly 6%, the growth trend shows no signs of abating. Airlines are doing everything they can to ensure smooth journeys for all travelers over the peak northern summer period. But our expectations of air navigation service providers (ANSPs) are already being tested. With 5.2 million minutes of air traffic control delays racked up in Europe even before the peak season begins, it is clear that Europe's ANSPs have unresolved challenges. And the 32,000 flight delays over the Memorial Day weekend in May show that challenges persist in the US too. Airlines are accountable to their customers; ANSPs must be as well. ANSP performance matters to their airline customers and to millions of travelers. We all need them to do their job efficiently,\" said Willie Walsh, IATA's director general.\n\nRegional Breakdown - International Passenger Markets\n\nAll regions showed strong growth for international passenger markets in May 2024 compared to May 2023. The load factor increased in all regions except North America.\n\nAsia-Pacific airlines continue to lead the way, with a 27.0% year-on-year increase in demand. Capacity increased 26.0% year-on-year and the load factor rose to 81.6% (+0.6ppt compared to May 2023). This performance maintains Asian carriers as the largest contributor to\n\nindustry-wide growth in May, accounting for 42% of the year-on-year increase.\n\nEuropean carriers saw an 11.7% year-on-year increase in demand. Capacity increased 11.3% year-on-year, and the load factor was 84.7% (up 0.3ppt compared to May 2023).\n\nMiddle Eastern airlines saw a 9.7% year-on-year increase in demand. Capacity increased 9.0% year-on-year and the load factor increased 0.5ppt to 80.7% compared to May 2023. Asian routes to the Middle East are particularly strong, now standing some 32% higher than in 2019. Another notable development is the Europe-Middle East route, which saw an April-May RPK increase for two years in a row, reversing the previous historic pattern of a decline between these months. In the coming months, it will become clearer to what extent these trends could be related to the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nNorth American carriers saw an 8.1% year-on-year increase in demand. Capacity increased 9.7% year-on-year, and the load factor fell to 84.0% (-1.2ppt compared to May 2023).\n\nLatin American airlines saw a 15.9% year-on-year increase in demand. Capacity climbed 14.3% year-on-year. The load factor rose to 85.1% (+1.2ppt compared to May 2023), the highest among the regions.\n\nAfrican airlines saw a 14.1% year-on-year increase in demand. Capacity was up 8.2% year- on-year. The load factor rose to 72.3% (+3.7ppt compared to May 2023). This was the fastest increase in load factor among all regions, although Africa still has the lowest load factor overall.\n\nDomestic Markets\n\nDomestic demand increased at a stable pace in May. China's growth rate surged in line with the post- Labor Day holidays. Japan declined -1.8% possibly reflecting low business and consumer confidence.",

Airlines achieved a record seat occupancy of 83.4% for the month. Despite strong demand, air traffic control delays in Europe and the US pose challenges. Willie Walsh, IATA's director general, emphasized the need for efficient air navigation service providers (ANSPs).\n\nRegionally, Asia-Pacific led with a 27.0% increase in demand, contributing 42% to the overall growth. European carriers saw an 11.7% rise, while Middle Eastern airlines experienced a 9.7% increase, with strong Asian and European routes. North American carriers had an 8.1% increase, but their load factor fell. Latin American airlines saw a 15.9% rise, achieving the highest load factor at 85.1%. African airlines had a 14.1% increase, with the fastest load factor growth, though still the lowest overall.\n\nDomestic markets showed stable growth, with significant increases in China post-Labor Day, while Japan saw a decline of 1.8%, possibly due to low business and consumer confidence."

This rejection follows six elections over the past three years, all resulting in unstable coalitions. GERB, which finished first in the June elections, holds only 68 of the 240 seats in the National Assembly. The party's leader, Boyko Borissov, who led three previous governments, opted not to become prime minister again, but his efforts to form a coalition failed.

They agreed to share the Prime Ministerial position on a rotation basis for the rest of the term of the Parliament.\n\nMeanwhile, the largest party in the ruling coalition - CPN-UML - withdrew support to Prime Minister Prachanda-led government.\n\nAlso Read | Russia-Ukraine War: Russian Missiles and Drones Strike Dnipro in Daylight Attack, Killing at Least 5, Injuring 47.\n\n\"Our party has withdrawn support to the government,\" said Bishnu Rijal, deputy chief of UML's publicity committee.\n\nThe CPN-UML has eight ministers in the Prachanda Cabinet, including Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Raghubir Mahaseth. The CPN-UML joined the government on March 5, after Prime Minister Prachanda allied with the CPN-UML, ditching its year-long partnership with the Congress.\n\nAll the UML ministers have submitted their resignations to the Prime Minister, Rijal added.\n\nNepali Congress, the largest party in the 275-member House of Representatives, has 89 seats at present, while CPN-UML has 78 seats. Their combined strength of 167 is sufficient for a majority of 138 seats in the lower house. Prachanda's party has 32 seats.\n\nThe Nepali Congress Central Work Performance Committee (CWC) earlier in the day met at Deuba's residence at Budhanilkantha to discuss the current political situation and the party's future strategy.\n\n\"The meeting reviewed the latest political situation in the country and discussed the future course of action,\" said NC spokesperson Prakash Sharan Mahat.\n\nThe meeting also endorsed the agreement reached between Deuba and Oli to form a new coalition and share the post of Prime Minister on a rotation basis, he said. The meeting mainly discussed the agenda and modality of formation of the new coalition government.\n\nThe seven-point deal finalised between Deuba and Oli on Monday night includes the sharing of the remaining three-year term of Parliament between the two parties, the ministerial division, provincial leadership roles and a rotation for the prime ministerial position. Oli will assume the post of Prime Minister in the first phase and after one-and-a-half-year, the Nepali Congress will get the leadership of the government.\n\nSpeaking to journalists after the meeting, party spokesperson Dr Prakash Sharan Mahat said, \"The prime minister should pave the way after the largest parties -- Nepali Congress and UML -- said they would form a new government together. This is also included in the decision.\"\n\n\"Other parties, too, are supporting the new Nepali Congress-UML alliance. So, the Nepali Congress CWC has requested the prime minister to pave the way,\" he added.\n\nMahat said a new government will be formed through the constitutional process if the prime minister does not pave the way for the formation of a new government.\n\nMeanwhile, the spokesperson of Janata Samajwadi Party Nepal Manish Suman said that his party will support the new coalition but has not yet decided on joining the government.\n\nJSP Nepal has five members in the Parliament. Rastriya Prajatantra Party with 14 members in the House of Representatives and Lokatantrik Samajwadi Party with four seats have also indicated support for the new coalition.\n\nHowever, embattled Prime Minister Prachanda has refused to resign from the post and said he would rather face a vote of confidence in Parliament.\n\nAccording to the constitutional provision, the prime minister losing a majority support in the House will be required to prove a majority within 30 days. The prime minister must seek a vote of confidence once a ruling alliance withdraws support. This will be the fifth time Prachanda, 69, will seek a vote of confidence within a term of one and a half years.\n\nThe former guerilla leader has won three votes of confidence in Parliament.\n\nThe CPN-UML has already urged Prime Minister Prachanda to step down from the position so that a new government can be formed as per the constitutional provision. It also asked all the political parties to join the \"national government\" under the leadership of Oli to bolster political stability in the country.\n\nNepal has had 13 governments in the last 16 years, indicating the fragile nature of the Himalayan nation's political system.",

It focuses only on generative AI and excludes artificial intelligence more broadly, which includes technologies like facial recognition or computer vision.\n\nAlso Read | Russia-Ukraine War: Russian Missiles and Drones Strike Dnipro in Daylight Attack, Killing at Least 5, Injuring 47.\n\n\"WIPO hopes to give everyone a better understanding of where this fast-evolving technology is being developed, and where it is headed,\" WIPO Director-General Daren Tang told reporters.\n\nOver the decade starting in 2014, over 38,200 GenAI inventions came from China. That's six times more than from the United States, which had nearly 6,300. They were trailed by South Korea with 4,155, Japan with more than 3,400 and India with 1,350.\n\nGenAI helps users create text, images, music, computer code and other content through the use of tools including ChatGPT from OpenAI, Google Gemini and Ernie from China's Baidu. The technology has been employed by many industries including the life sciences, manufacturing, transportation, security and telecommunications.\n\nSome critics fear that GenAI could replace workers in some types of jobs or improperly take human-generated content without fair or adequate compensation to the people behind it.\n\nAs with other types of patent applications, WIPO officials acknowledge that the quantity of GenAI patents doesn't indicate quality. It's hard to tell so early in the technology which patents will have market value or be transformative for society.\n\n\"Let's see how the the data and how the developments unfold over time,\" Tang said.\n\nThe U.S. and China are often seen as rivals in the development of artificial intelligence, but by some measures U.S. tech companies are taking the lead in making the world's most cutting-edge AI systems.\n\nSixty-one notable machine-learning models emerged from U.S.-based institutions in 2023, outpacing the European Union's 21 and China's 15, according to the annual AI Index from Stanford University's Institute for Human-centered Artificial Intelligence. Of EU countries, France had the most, with eight.\n\nBy another measure, the U.S. also has the most so-called AI foundation models -- such as OpenAI's GPT-4, Anthropic's Claude 3, Gemini and Meta's Llama, which are huge, versatile and trained on massive datasets.\n\nThe U.S. also has led China in private AI investments and the number of newly formed AI startups, while China has led in industrial robotics.

But as Democrats make the case the stakes of the election are momentous -- challenging no less than the foundations of American democracy -- they're wrestling with how to approach the 81-year-old who's supposed to be leading the charge for their party.\n\nAlso Read | Pakistan: PTI Chief Imran Khan Seeks Permission From Rawalpindi Court To Meet His Sons, Qasim and Sulaiman, in Adiala Jail.\n\nHere's how Democrats are handling the debate aftermath:\n\nRaising alarm\n\nAlso Read | Russia-Ukraine War: Russian Missiles and Drones Strike Dnipro in Daylight Attack, Killing at Least 5, Injuring 47.\n\nRep.

He praised Biden but said he \"has the opportunity to encourage a new generation of leaders from whom a nominee can be chosen to unite our country through an open, democratic process.\"\n\n\"Recognizing that, unlike Trump, President Biden's first commitment has always been to our country, not himself, I am hopeful that he will make the painful and difficult decision to withdraw. I respectfully call on him to do so,\" said Doggett, who's 77.\n\nSome other congressional Democrats have moved in recent days to outspoken concern not just over Biden's performance during the 90-minute debate last week but also the level of transparency Biden's team has offered about his mental fitness. They've tiptoed toward embracing the idea Biden should withdraw.\n\n\"Everybody is asking one question within the Democratic Party ... which is how do we defeat Donald Trump and how are we going to defeat the threat of authoritarianism,\" Rep. Jamie Raskin, a prominent Democrat from Maryland, said on MSNBC late Tuesday.\n\nHe added that the question of whether Biden stays as the presidential candidate or Democrats select someone else \"is a moving target. It has to happen quickly.\"\n\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., told a local CBS-affiliated television station he was \"horrified\" by both Biden's performance and Trump's falsehoods during the debate.\n\n\"People want to make sure that this is a campaign that's ready to go and win,\" Whitehouse said. \"That the president and his team are being candid with us about his condition -- that this was a real anomaly.\"\n\nSome are concerned Biden's weaknesses could tamp down potential voters' enthusiasm, creating a ripple effect that hurts Democrats as they try to maintain a narrow Senate majority and take back control of the House. Down-ballot Democrats are already confident they can outperform Biden in swing races, but if large numbers of voters reject Biden, it could impact them.\n\nWhile several vulnerable Democrats have stopped short of calling for Biden to withdraw, they've also cast the situation in stark terms: If Biden continues, he'll lose.\n\n\"The truth, I think, is that Biden is going to lose to Trump,\" Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, a Washington Democrat, told an ABC-affiliated television station. \"I know that's difficult, but I think the damage has been done by that debate.\"\n\nBacking Biden\n\nWith Biden's family urging him to stay in the race, attention has turned to senior Democratic lawmakers who could potentially persuade the president to withdraw his nomination. So far, top Democratic leaders have mostly stood behind Biden in public statements.\n\n\"There have not been discussions among senior leadership about anything other than making sure we continue to articulate a compelling vision for the future to the American people related to the issues of importance around the economy,\" House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters Monday in Pittsburgh.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, posted on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, after the debate that it showed voters there was a choice between \"four more years of progress, or four more years of attacks on our fundamental rights and our democracy.\"\n\nBiden was speaking with congressional leaders this week, the White House said Tuesday. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said they respected the opinions and thoughts of concerned party members, adding, \"that's what makes this party different than the other side.\"\n\nMany of Biden's allies have chided the news media for being fixated on Biden's mental capacities, arguing that instead the focus should be put on Trump's record of refusing to accept the results of the 2020 election he lost to Biden and repeatedly lying.\n\nRep. Veronica Escobar, a Texas Democrat who's part of Biden's campaign committee, conceded the debate wasn't what she hoped for but added, \"I think there needs to be a real conversation about the things that Donald Trump said. It is beyond vile.\"\n\nRep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., who was among Biden's surrogates at the debate, dismissed concerns.\n\n\"We are 100% behind Joe Biden,\" he said Friday. \"Crystal clear, end of story. He's our nominee. So anything else outside of that is just political chatter.\"\n\nFeeling it out\n\nThe June 27 debate infused a new dynamic into an election contest that had been marked by few surprises. Voters were familiar with Biden and Trump and had previously decided between the two in 2020.\n\nStill, many House Democrats were caught in a state of uncertainty as they faced a barrage of questions on the morning after the debate. Some chalked it up as little more than a bad night for Biden, but others are watching closely to see how voters react and whether Biden can execute a quick political recovery.\n\nRep. James Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat who helped Biden win the Democratic nomination in 2020, urged his party last week to \"stay the course.\"\n\nBy Tuesday, Clyburn was still supporting Biden for president, but he also told MSNBC that \"Biden may decide otherwise.\" Clyburn added that he would support Vice President Kamala Harris if Biden withdrew.\n\nClyburn and others like former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., are recommending that Biden prove to the American people that he's ready for another four years in office by going out and taking tough interviews -- something he has rarely done in recent years. Biden will sit for an interview with ABC, his first since the debate, later in the week.\n\nBoth Clyburn and Pelosi told MSNBC at midday Tuesday that they had not spoken directly with Biden since the debate. But Pelosi still emphasized that the president is on \"top of his game, in terms of knowing the issues and what is at stake.\"\n\nShe called on both Biden and Trump, who's 78, to face tests for their health and mental acuity.\n\n\"I think it is a legitimate question to say is this an episode or is this a condition. So when people ask that question, it's legitimate -- of both candidates,\" said Pelosi, who's 84.\n\nMeanwhile, rank-and-file lawmakers are watching to see how voter polls register the impact and whether it spills into down-ballot races. For months, vulnerable House Democrats have been distancing themselves from some of Biden's policies. That phenomenon could become more pronounced after the debate.\n\nRep. Jared Golden, a moderate Democrat from Maine, was already looking for ways to convince potential Trump voters to support him.\n\n\"While I don't plan to vote for him, Donald Trump is going to win,\" Golden said in a Bangor Daily News op-ed. \"And I'm OK with that.\" (AP)",

Concerns about Biden's age and mental fitness have been amplified, with some Democrats like Rep. Lloyd Doggett openly calling for his withdrawal. Others, including Rep. Jamie Raskin and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, express worries about Biden's ability to defeat Donald Trump and the potential negative impact on down-ballot races. Despite these concerns, senior Democratic leaders like House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer continue to publicly support Biden. The debate has introduced uncertainty into the election, with some Democrats suggesting Biden needs to demonstrate his readiness for another term through more public engagements and interviews. The situation remains fluid as lawmakers and voters react to the unfolding events."

        "title": "欧盟对华战略会不会走向全面复制美国路线？",
        "body": "尊敬的用户您好，这是来自FT中文网的温馨提示：如您对更多FT中文网的内容感兴趣，请在苹果应用商店或谷歌应用市场搜索\"FT中文网\"，下载FT中文网的官方应用。\n\n欧盟和美国在对华路线上的共通点在于欧盟和美国都在谈\"去风险\"，但它们之间最大的区别目前在于，前者在某些领域寻求去风险，后者在某些领域行脱钩。\n\n这一点区别也体现在了欧美最近对中国进口的关税举措上。在欧盟尚未揭晓其针对中国电动汽车进口反补贴税之前，美国公布了针对中国产品的超高关税，涉及范围之广，关税之高，称得上全面遏制。在美国盟友热切希望欧盟能追随自己的步伐的情况下，欧盟6月12日公布的临时反补贴税没有完全复制美国版本，而且，中欧双方已表示就此问题进行谈判。\n\n其实，谈中欧关系，谈的是一个笼统、庞大却并不具象的关系，它包含了中德关系和中法关系在内的中国和某成员国的关系，也包括了中国和欧洲某一地区的关系，比如中国和中东欧。因为欧盟既是一个整体，又包含了很多个性不一的个体，欧盟作为市场既是一个单一市场，又分成了很多市场。所以，因为成员国之间的差异，中欧关系也会经历变化和波动，而欧盟的总体定调也会影响到成员国和中国的两国关系，而成员国和中国的两国关系也会影响到欧盟作为整体对华政策的调整。\n\n这一变化和波动体现在了中国 -- 中东欧国家合作机制当中，该覆盖了欧盟国家和非欧盟国家的合作机制，在过去的十余年间经历了从16+1，变成17+1，再变成16+1，再到14+1。2021年，中国和立陶宛关系出现波折，后者退出该合作机制，同为波罗的海国家的爱沙尼亚和拉脱维亚紧随其后。而因为立陶宛和台湾互设代表处触碰了北京的底线，中国和立陶宛关系一度恶化，也直接推动了欧盟层面的反经济胁迫工具立法，该立法被称作为\"放在谈判桌上的一把枪\"。小欧盟国如立陶宛，在对华路线上如此刚烈，充分展现了大于其体量的影响力量。而同样加入了该机制的欧盟国家匈牙利，则和中国之间的关系越来越紧密。今年5月，中国和匈牙利两国领导人宣布，将中匈关系提升为新时代全天候全面战略伙伴关系。外交部长王毅在6月底同匈牙利外长通话时强调，中方愿同匈方一道，落实好两国领导人重要共识，推动中匈关系继续走在中欧关系前列。匈牙利外长则表示，匈方愿以担任欧盟轮值主席国为契机，推动欧中增进理解，提升合作效能，反对保护主义，坚持通过对话协商解决贸易摩擦。这些\"强调\"和\"表态\"的具体所指自然包含了欧盟针对中国电动汽车进口的反补贴税。\n\n中国的\"一带一路\"倡议同样覆盖了非欧盟国家和欧盟国家。2019年，中国与意大利两国签署了共同推进\"一带一路\"建设谅解备忘录，两国还签署了29项合作协议或合作意向书。当时，在质疑者的眼中，问题的严峻性不仅仅在于意大利是欧盟核心成员国，还在于其签署协议的首个G7成员国身份。2023年底，意大利政府宣布将退出一带一路。意大利的一进一退固然在于经贸上的考量，更出于政治决策。我在《意大利在\"印度-中东-欧洲经济走廊\"和\"一带一路\"上的进退取舍，意味着什么？》一文中曾指出，意大利意欲退出并非单纯基于经济考量，退出也不是梅洛尼个人意志那么简单。意大利面临了来自美国和欧盟的压力。2019年，意大利加入\"一带一路\"时，在西方的解读中，不是意大利的加入，而是第一个G7国的加入。欧洲内部的担忧集中在意大利的做法可能会制造欧盟成员国内部的分歧。而意大利国内甚至有人称，加入\"一带一路\"是意大利疑欧派政府针对法国、德国和布鲁塞尔的\"软平衡战略\"，通过加强与中国的关系来获得和其他欧盟成员国在其他问题谈判中的主动权。而2022年，梅洛尼上台后，奉行的是亲欧亲美路线。意大利的一进一退事件同样体现了中欧关系的复杂性和波动性。\n\n无论是中国 -- 中东欧国家合作机制，还是一带一路，都被对华强硬派解读为中国对欧政策的\"分而治之\"，认定中国在寻求薄弱环节，并予以突破。在他们看来，意大利是曾经的\"薄弱环节\"，匈牙利则是目前的\"薄弱环节\"。他们也焦虑欧盟成员国之间相互竞争，争取与中国更紧密的经贸关系，而不是相互协调。在欧盟对中国电动汽车进口的反补贴税问题上，德法之间的利益分歧就是一个例子。\n\n而在过去的三四年间，欧盟对华路线中政治的比重越来越大，安全和经济之间的界限越来越模糊，究其原因除了常态的人权等问题，还有新冠疫情和俄乌战争这些重大的黑天鹅和灰犀牛事件对欧盟造成的冲击。2021年，欧盟暂缓批准中欧全面投资协定，于此，代表了开放和合作的协定在经历了漫长的谈判后遭遇冻结。而在两次事件的背景下，该协定并没有解冻的迹象。至于欧盟方这两年反复强调贸易逆差、过剩产能和政府补贴，也与这些形势紧密相关。在《欧盟为何如此担忧对华贸易逆差？》一文中，贸易专家刘宛鑫表示，新冠疫情、尤其是俄乌战争，促使欧盟减少对华经济依赖和力求供应链多元化，然而 2022 年欧盟从中国的进口不仅增加，而且是剧增，这让欧盟更加担心对华经济依赖问题，与此同时，欧盟对华出口的增加极其有限，这让欧盟更加担心，中国包括双循环和2025中国制造在内的相关政策是否加剧欧企在华遭遇不公平竞争，尤其涉及到汽车与机器等欧企传统优势产业时。\n\n俄乌战争造成的影响不止于此。目前为止，欧盟没有看到中方在俄乌战争上采取他们想看到的立场。日前，来自欧美几家智库的三位学者因此主张，欧洲对华政策制定者应重审中国作为合作伙伴、竞争对手和制度对手的角色之外，是否还构成了欧洲的安全威胁。欧盟对华路线近两年的变化体现为重心在向三者中的后两者偏移，但如果加上安全威胁，那其实就是全面复制美国路线。",

        "summary": "The article discusses the European Union's (EU) strategy towards China and whether it will fully replicate the United States' (US) approach. Both the EU and the US aim to \"de-risk\" their relations with China, but the US has taken more aggressive steps, such as imposing high tariffs on Chinese imports. The EU, on the other hand, has implemented temporary anti-subsidy tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and is negotiating with China on this issue.\n\nThe EU's relationship with China is complex and varies among its member states. For instance, Lithuania's exit from the China-Central and Eastern European Countries (China-CEEC) cooperation mechanism and its establishment of representative offices with Taiwan strained its relations with China, influencing EU-wide policies. Conversely, Hungary has strengthened its ties with China, highlighting the varied stances within the EU.\n\nItaly's fluctuating involvement in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) also exemplifies the EU's internal divisions. Italy joined the BRI in 2019 but announced its withdrawal in 2023 due to political and economic pressures from the US and the EU.\n\nThe article notes that the EU's China policy has increasingly incorporated political and security considerations, influenced by events like the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war. These events have led the EU to reconsider its economic dependencies and supply chain diversification. The EU's concerns about trade deficits, overcapacity, and government subsidies are also tied to these broader geopolitical shifts.\n\nIn summary, while the EU shares some common goals with the US regarding China, it has not fully adopted the US's more confrontational approach. The EU's strategy is shaped by its internal diversity and the evolving geopolitical landscape."

        "title": "俄乌冲突提示中国：1300多架歼-7/8、2000多辆59别扔，还有大用处_手机网易网",
        "body": "俄乌冲突提醒中国：1300多架歼-7/8、2000多辆59别扔，还有大用处。在战争中，老旧装备往往能够在关键时刻发挥应急作用。现代战争中的武器装备消耗速度极快，特别是在战斗胶着状态下，各种先进武器和装备的损失可能会远超预期。\n\n在这种情况下，老旧装备可以作为一种重要的补充力量，用于填补先进武器短缺所造成的战斗力空缺。尽管这些装备可能在技术和性能上不如现代装备，但在特定战斗环境中仍能发挥重要作用，为前线提供急需的火力支持和战斗力量。\n\n俄乌战争中的实际情况正好印证了这一点。在俄乌冲突初期，俄罗斯在对基辅的突击行动中遭遇了重大挫折，不仅行动失败，还损失了大量重型装备。在这种紧急情况下，俄罗斯不得不翻新苏联时期封存的T-62坦克，以应对前线装备不足的问题。尽管T-62坦克在技术水平上已经显得落后，但通过适当的翻新和改装，这些老旧坦克仍能够在战场上发挥一定的作用，特别是在支援步兵和远程火炮方面。\n\n具体而言，T-62坦克在战场上的实战价值主要体现在以下几个方面。首先，在顿巴斯地区的战斗中，T-62坦克被广泛用于支援当地民兵。这些坦克虽然不具备现代坦克的先进技术，但其坚固的装甲和强大的火力仍能为步兵提供可靠的掩护和支援。此外，在新的坦克到达前，俄罗斯军队尽量利用T-62坦克来填补战斗空白，确保前线的战斗力不会因为装备不足而受到严重削弱。最后，T-62坦克还被改装为所谓的\"豪猪坦克\"，用于对付自杀式无人机（FPV），这种改装有效地提高了坦克在特定战术环境下的生存能力。\n\n类似的情况在中国人民解放军的59式中型坦克中也有所体现。59式中型坦克自服役以来，一直是解放军装甲部队的重要组成部分。尽管这种坦克的设计已经有数十年的历史，但通过多次升级和改装，59式坦克仍具备一定的战斗力。例如，升级后的59式坦克装备了105毫米坦克炮和反应装甲，显著提升了其火力和防护能力，使其在现代战场上依然具有一定的战斗价值。\n\n在亚太地区的潜在冲突中，59式坦克的战略价值不容忽视。首先，在支援朝鲜对抗美韩装甲单位方面，59式坦克可以发挥重要作用。尽管其技术水平不及美韩现代坦克，但通过数量优势和适当的战术运用，59式坦克能够有效地对抗敌方装甲部队，为友军提供必要的火力支援和战斗力量。其次，在可能的亚太大战中，59式坦克的大量存在使得解放军能够在短时间内部署大量装甲部队，迅速形成对敌方装甲单位的数量压制，从而在战术上占据主动。\n\n尽管59式坦克和T-62坦克都属于老旧装备，但它们的升级潜力仍然相当大。例如，通过为59式坦克换装新的动力包、炮塔和火炮，可以显著提升其战斗性能，使其接近三代坦克的火力水平。这种升级不仅能够延长坦克的服役寿命，还能在一定程度上提高其在现代战场上的生存能力和战斗力。\n\n此外，还有一种更加激进的改装方案，即将59式坦克改装为无人作战坦克。通过这种改装，可以有效提高坦克的性价比，同时减少人员伤亡。在对抗西方地面装备和弹药消耗战中，无人作战坦克可以发挥独特的作用。无人坦克不仅能够执行高风险任务，还能在一定程度上消耗敌方的弹药和装备，从而为友军创造有利的战斗环境。\n\n歼7和歼8战机曾是中国国土防空的主力机型，在冷战和后冷战时期，它们肩负着保卫中国领空的重要任务。这些战机虽然已经逐渐被更先进的机型所替代，但它们在中国空军的历史上依然占据着重要位置。目前，中国封存了1300多架歼7/8改进型战机，其中部分战机具备主动弹发射能力。尽管这些战机的技术水平已经落后，但它们依然保留了一定的作战潜力，可以在特定条件下发挥作用。\n\n这些封存的老旧战机不仅可以作为援助其他国家的军事物资，还对中国人民解放军有潜在的利用价值。通过合理的改造和升级，这些老旧战机可以重新焕发活力，成为解放军的一支重要辅助力量。特别是在现代战争日益依赖技术和智能化的背景下，这些老旧战机的潜在用途得到了重新评估。\n\n美国国防高级计划研究局（DARPA）近年来大力推进AI空战技术的发展，其空战进化项目便是一个重要的里程碑。这个项目通过模拟AI操控战机与人类飞行员的空战对决，证明了AI技术在空战中的可行性和潜力。在一系列的测试中，AI操控的战机在模拟空战中多次战胜人类飞行员，展示了其卓越的战术计算和反应能力。\n\n这一技术发展对中国空军产生了深远的影响。AI操控战机的成功不仅证明了其在现代空战中的潜力，还揭示了未来空战的发展趋势。中国空军应当积极跟进这一技术趋势，确保在未来的空战中不落后于人。通过引进和发展AI空战技术，中国空军可以显著提升其战斗力和战术灵活性。\n\n在这一背景下，利用AI技术对封存的歼7/8战机进行改造，成为了一个具有战略意义的设想。虽然歼7/8作为二代机在性能上有限，但通过AI技术的加持，这些战机可以重新飞上蓝天，成为一种消耗敌方空空导弹的重要手段。AI操控的歼7/8战机可以执行高风险任务，在与敌方先进战机的对抗中消耗敌方的弹药和资源，从而为中国的更先进战机创造有利的战斗条件。\n\n在中美大规模空战的战略假设中，AI驾驶的歼7/8战机具备重要的战术价值。通过大量部署这些AI改造的老旧战机，中国空军可以在战术上形成对敌方的数量优势，迫使敌方消耗大量的空空导弹和其他高价值武器系统。这种战术不仅可以削弱敌方的战斗力，还能为中国的先进战机创造更好的战斗机会，使其在关键时刻能够发挥最大的战斗效能。\n\n推动AI空战项目对中国空军来说具有重要的战略意义。通过积极追赶和发展AI空战技术，中国空军可以在未来的空战中保持技术领先地位，避免因技术落后而处于被动局面。AI技术不仅可以提升战机的作战能力，还能在指挥、控制和战术决策方面发挥重要作用，从而全面提升空军的战斗力和战略灵活性。\n\n如果中国空军不能及时跟进和发展AI空战技术，将面临巨大的被动风险。现代空战中，技术的优劣往往决定了战斗的胜负。如果在未来的战争中无法拥有与敌方相匹配的AI技术，中国空军可能在战术和战略上都处于不利地位，难以有效应对敌方的先进战机和战术手段。因此，发展AI空战技术不仅是提升战斗力的必要手段，也是确保国家安全和战略利益的重要保障。\n\n总的来说，歼7/8战机的历史与现状展示了老旧装备在现代军事中的潜在价值。通过AI技术的改造和升级，这些老旧战机可以重新焕发活力，在未来的空战中发挥重要作用。中国空军应当积极跟进和发展AI空战技术，确保在未来的战争中保持技术和战术上的领先地位，从而有效维护国家安全和战略利益。\n\n图片来自网络，如有侵权，联系删除！",

It highlights how Russia had to refurbish Soviet-era T-62 tanks to compensate for equipment losses during the conflict. These tanks, despite being outdated, provided crucial support in specific combat scenarios.\n\nThe article draws parallels to China's military, emphasizing the potential value of its old J-7/8 fighter jets and Type 59 tanks. It suggests that these older models, through upgrades and modifications, can still play significant roles in combat, especially in scenarios where advanced equipment is in short supply.\n\nThe piece also explores the potential of AI technology in modernizing these old assets. It mentions the U.S. DARPA's advancements in AI-controlled air combat, suggesting that China could similarly upgrade its J-7/8 jets with AI to enhance their combat effectiveness and strategic value.\n\nOverall, the article underscores the importance of not discarding old military equipment, as they can be upgraded to provide substantial support in modern warfare, thereby maintaining a strategic advantage."

        "body": "俄罗斯总统普京与中国国家领导人习近平本周三借上合组织峰会再度会面。短短两月内，两位领导人再度会面，能否就结束俄乌危机达成一定共识？而中国意图借上合组织推广其影响力的目的能达成吗？\n\n中共党媒新华社最新报道，在上合组织峰会召开之际，俄罗斯总统普京（Vladimir Putin）与中国国家领导人习近平本周三（7月3日）再度会面。\n\n美联社指，此次会面是普京今年五月访问北京以来中俄领导人的再次聚首，这次见面显示两人在同样面对与西方地缘政治关系持续紧张之际，再次展示牢固的\"战略伙伴关系\"。\n\n新加坡国立大学政治系副教授庄嘉颖认为，中国与俄罗斯、尤其是俄罗斯通过参加峰会展现并没有被国际社会完全孤立，但中俄借此舞台扩大其影响力的效果有限。他说，成员国在经贸合作上可能会达成一些实质性协议，即便如此，也无法为中俄两国国内经济复苏提供新的增长点。\n\n他说：\"对中国来说，在经贸和能源进口这些方面会有一定保障，能让它的经济比较稳定，可是稳定不代表增长。至于说俄罗斯，经过中亚国家，它的能源可以往其他国家，包括中国等外销，也会有一定的经济保障效果。\"\n\n美国智库威尔逊中心基辛格中美研究所主任戴博（Robert Daly）在接受本台采访时表示：\"显然，中国希望利用上合组织、金砖国家、'一带一路'、三大发展倡议和其他各种区域论坛来加强其作为'全球南方领导者'的地位。换句话说，中国希望被视为提供一整套替代二战后建立的制度、规范和价值观的解决方案。\"\n\n不过，在俄乌战争进入关键阶段之际，中俄关系的紧密正受到包括北大西洋公约组织(NATO)和日本、澳大利亚等亚洲国家的关注。\n\n彭博社报道另指，芬兰总统斯图布（Alexander Stubb）日前在接受采访时表示，俄罗斯的依赖让中国获得了更强实力，中国只需一通电话就能结束俄罗斯在乌克兰发动的战争。\n\n美国国务卿布林肯（Antony Blinken）本周一在华盛顿智库布鲁金斯学会的研讨会上也指出，随着中国与俄罗斯带来的安全风险加剧，中国对俄罗斯持续提供援助，在俄罗斯发展为欧洲面临的最大安全威胁之一中，中国扮演了推波助澜的角色。因此美国政策需要打破欧洲、亚洲联盟之间的隔阂。\n\n\"我认为中国的目标非常明确。随着时间的推移，在未来几十年里，他们希望成为国际体系中军事、经济和外交的领先主导国，这是显而易见的。\"布林肯指出：\"如果他们对世界的愿景与我们或其他许多国家相符，那将是一回事，但他们对未来有不同的看法。因此，我们将非常激烈地竞争，以确保我们能够有效塑造未来。\"\n\n但是，普京和习近平此次会面能否就结束俄乌危机达成一定共识？戴博分析认为，中俄达成实质性共识的概率极低。\n\n\"他们也许能够推出一份文件，写着'尊重各国合法安全关切'、'霸权不好'等含糊、毫无意义的话，俄罗斯会声称这是中国支持的表现，但那又能怎么样？\"他说：\"就连中国也不想完全参与俄罗斯的残酷侵略，中亚国家和印度也不会支持俄罗斯的行动，即便他们不会直接批评俄罗斯的入侵行为。\"\n\n上合组织作为一个政治和安全组织，由中国和俄罗斯于2001年发起，成员国包括哈萨克斯坦等中亚五国，及印度、伊朗、巴基斯坦。本次峰会预计重点讨论经济、能源、反恐问题，同时涉及俄乌战争和其他地缘政治问题。\n\n戴博分析指出，由于\"全球南方\"内部存在分歧，这一团体是否需要被领导、是否像中俄一样反对发达民主国家、中国能否提出一个完美的替代方案等问题犹在，因此他认为，中国很难通过上合组织等区域论坛来制衡西方在国际舞台的影响力。",

        "summary": "**Summary:**\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping met again on Wednesday, July 3, at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, marking their second meeting in two months. This summit, held amidst ongoing geopolitical tensions with the West, aims to showcase the strong \"strategic partnership\" between China and Russia. Experts suggest that while the summit may result in some economic agreements, it is unlikely to significantly boost the domestic economies of either country. The meeting also highlights China's efforts to strengthen its global influence through various regional forums. However, the close China-Russia relationship is drawing attention from NATO and countries like Japan and Australia. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken emphasized the growing security risks posed by this alliance. Despite the summit, experts believe it is improbable that China and Russia will reach a substantial consensus on ending the Russia-Ukraine crisis. The SCO, founded by China and Russia in 2001, includes several Central Asian countries, India, Iran, and Pakistan, and focuses on economic, energy, and anti-terrorism issues, along with the Russia-Ukraine war and other geopolitical matters."

        "title": "新混战即将打响！朝鲜出兵乌克兰？泽连斯基紧急电联中国寻求帮助_手机网易网",
        "body": "俄朝刚签完军事互助协议，想不到朝鲜这么快就开始出兵了。有媒体爆料称，在朝鲜最高领导人金正恩的授权下，朝鲜4个工兵旅共计2万人的队伍，将于近日抵达东乌地区。他们此行的目的并不是直接参与到俄乌战争中，而是为了帮助俄罗斯加强在东乌地区的军事工事。不过此举遭到了美韩的强烈反对，泽连斯基也一时间慌了神。因为朝鲜此举虽然并未直接参战，但已经等同于间接这么做的。毕竟朝鲜的工兵抵达后，俄罗斯就可以从修筑工事的队伍中抽调更多的兵力，投入到对乌的前线战场。\n\n这让泽连斯基当然难以承受，美韩之所以坐不住，很显然他们是在担心，经此一事后，如果未来朝鲜遇到麻烦的话，俄罗斯大概率会出手帮助解决。那么军事同盟关系正式生效，这对美韩来说，当然是个坏消息。然而现在最紧张的当属乌克兰总统泽连斯基，如果他准备在前线放手一搏，能扭转局势吗？有媒体爆料称，泽连斯基终于扛不住压力向中国求援了，乌克兰计划在7月份从扎波罗热和顿涅茨克地区发动大规模反攻。虽然乌克兰现在背后有超过20个北约国家的资源，但几次较量的结果却让泽连斯基无法接受，因为不但没有优势，反而还出现了劣势。\n\n现在朝鲜也开始介入，那就更加不利于乌克兰扭转战局了。这样的局面下，泽连斯基选择把目光转向中国，希望中方能出手帮助化解这次危机。泽连斯基在求助中国的时候，似乎忘了他在香格里拉对话会上，对中国那充满敌意的态度了。竟公然批评中国干扰\"瑞士和平峰会\"，现在有麻烦了，又想到中国了。其实在这次中国没有参加的\"瑞士和平峰会\"上，世界所有国家再一次见识到了中国在全球的影响力。因为在中方宣布不参加峰会后，十多个国家先后都表态也不参加了。包括南非、印度、巴西等国也都没有在联合公报上签字，而这些国家要么是金砖成员国，要么就是中国\"一带一路\"的合作伙伴，中国的影响力高下立见。\n\n另一方面，泽连斯基也担心，一旦跟中国闹僵，害怕真的会将中方推向俄罗斯那边，那可就得不偿失了。但不得不说，泽连斯基的担忧有点多余了，中方早已明确立场，在俄乌冲突中保持中立，不站队任何一方，中方也一直在推动俄乌双方通过政治解决问题，是乌克兰一味地对美西方听之任之，才导致这场冲突持续到现在。当务之急，乌方应当端正自己的态度，认清俄罗斯在前线占据优势的事实，尽快坐到谈判桌前，在中国等中立国家的推动下，达成符合双方利益的和平方案，避免造成更多伤亡。",

        "summary": "A new conflict is brewing as North Korea prepares to send troops to Ukraine. Following a recent military assistance agreement with Russia, North Korea, under Kim Jong-un's authorization, is dispatching 20,000 soldiers to Eastern Ukraine to help fortify Russian military positions. This move, although not direct participation in the Russia-Ukraine war, has drawn strong opposition from the US and South Korea and has alarmed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The presence of North Korean troops could allow Russia to reallocate more forces to the front lines against Ukraine.\n\nIn response, Zelensky has urgently sought help from China, despite previously criticizing China at the Shangri-La Dialogue. Ukraine plans a major counteroffensive in July from Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk regions but has struggled despite support from over 20 NATO countries. Zelensky's appeal to China highlights his concern over the shifting dynamics and the potential for China to side with Russia. However, China has maintained a neutral stance in the conflict, advocating for a political resolution. The article suggests that Ukraine should adopt a more realistic approach, acknowledge Russia's frontline advantages, and engage in peace negotiations facilitated by neutral countries like China to prevent further casualties."

        "body": "芬兰总统亚历山大-斯图布说，俄罗斯对中国的依赖已经到了这样的地步：如果中国政府愿意，它就可以结束乌克兰战争。\n\n芬兰总统斯图布（Alexander Stubb）周二在赫尔辛基接受采访时表示：\"俄罗斯现在非常依赖中国\"。\"习近平主席一个电话就能解决这场危机\"。\n\n彭博社说，此番言论反映出乌克兰的盟国对中国\"被认为支持俄罗斯的战争努力\"感到\"日益沮丧\"。他们指责北京向克里姆林宫提供武器技术和零部件，并帮助莫斯科绕过国际贸易限制。\n\n这位56岁的芬兰新总统说：\"如果他说：'是时候开始和平谈判了'，俄罗斯将被迫这样做\"。\"他们别无选择\"。\n\n中国拒绝了这一建议\n\n中国外交部发言人毛宁周三在北京举行的例行记者会上说：\"中国和俄罗斯都是独立的大国。中国没有制造乌克兰危机。她还保证，\"我们将始终站在和平对话的立场上，与包括俄罗斯在内的有关各方保持沟通，为政治解决危机发挥建设性作用\"。\n\n彭博社这篇报道说，习近平一直试图在有关俄乌战争的讨论中将中国描绘成一个中立者。中国政府还批评俄罗斯袭击平民并威胁使用核武器。但中国原则上反对国际制裁，称其只尊重联合国支持的制裁，并指责美国及其盟友向乌克兰提供武器，助长了战争。\n\n贸易：中俄升 欧俄降\n\n据彭博汇编的统计数据，去年中国占俄罗斯贸易总额约28%，高于 2021年的19%。相比之下，欧盟在俄罗斯贸易中所占份额从同期的36%降至17%。\n\n习近平于5月16日在北京接待了俄罗斯总统普京，并呼吁召开包括俄罗斯和乌克兰在内的国际会议，以解决他所说的\"乌克兰问题\"。\n\n习近平和普京参加周三在哈萨克斯坦首都阿斯塔纳开幕的上海合作组织峰会。他们在那里会晤。\n\n芬兰新任国家元首于3月1日宣誓就职，在这个拥有550万人口的国家，他曾担任过总理、财政部长和外交部长。他的前任绍利-尼尼斯托（Sauli Niinisto）在执政12年后达到了宪法规定的任期限制。\n\n终结俄侵乌对中国有利\n\n斯图布总统在这座19世纪的镀金总统府里（以前芬兰还是沙俄帝国一部分时的官邸）发表讲话时说，结束普京在乌克兰的\"侵略和殖民战争\"对中国有利。因为\"中国需要维护有关领土完整和主权的国际规则。\"这是正确的做法。而且也能展现中国的领导力。\"\n\n欧盟国家当中最亲俄的领导人、匈牙利总理维克托·奥尔班周二表示，他已要求乌克兰总统弗拉基米尔·泽连斯基与俄罗斯进行谈判，寻求迅速停火。芬兰总统表示了不同意。\n\n\"俄只懂力量\"\n\n芬兰总统斯图布说，\"目前推动停火是不可能的，需要进行真正的和平谈判\"。而\"俄罗斯唯一懂得的就是力量。因此，我们现在越能帮助乌克兰，战争就能越快结束。\"\n\n斯图布还敦促欧洲加强对乌克兰的支持，同时增强自身在传统军事领域以及应对俄罗斯混合战争的防御能力。\n\n斯图布表示，乌克兰既需要物质帮助（包括财政援助），也需要政治支持，包括为加入欧盟和北大西洋公约组织铺平道路。\n\n他说，欧洲需要向\"战时经济\"转型，需要汇集弹药和武器订单，使国防工业具有长远前景。除了国家资助外，斯图布还呼吁他曾担任副总裁的欧洲投资银行超越红线，开始更加\"看好\"军事工业的发展。\n\n俄罗斯混合战包括移民\n\n芬兰和北约东翼大多数国家一样，在最近几个月里经历了俄罗斯部分类型的混合战：网络攻击、干扰全球定位系统、侵犯领空、将移民作为\"军事手段\"...。\n\n斯塔布总统说：\"俄罗斯试图通过混合攻击让我们反应过度或做出不寻常反应。不过，将俄罗斯混合攻击进行归因，也有助于制止这种袭击\"。\"如果你拒绝承认现实或不予理睬，那么我认为俄罗斯会继续这样做下去。\"\n\n芬兰与俄罗斯的边境超过 1,300 公里（800 英里），守卫着北约与其主要对手一半的边界，并拥有充满艰辛的与俄罗斯共存的历史。\n\n作为俄罗斯帝国的一个大公国，芬兰人在经历了 100 多年的俄统后，于 1917 年赢得了独立，并与苏联进行了两次战争，1944 年割让了部分领土。芬兰随后在冷战期间小心翼翼度过了中立时期（迫不得已，而非选择）。在服从莫斯科的同时，根据所谓的芬兰化政策保留其独立性。这一政策后来被称为 \"芬兰化\"（Finlandization）。\n\n欧洲最强炮兵\n\n苏联解体后，芬兰效仿瑞典加入欧盟，两国于 1995 年加入欧盟。不过，在 2022 年俄罗斯入侵乌克兰之前，芬兰的政策制定者几乎从未将俄罗斯（至少在公开场合）视为主要军事威胁。但在2023 年 4 月，芬兰加入了北约。\n\n为了生存，这个北欧国家始终对俄罗斯保持警惕。它在战时能够部署 28 万军队，并拥有欧洲最强大的炮兵部队之一。\n\n斯塔布说，芬兰目前在地缘政治和地缘战略上是欧洲最重要的国家之一，因为我们刚刚将北约与俄罗斯的边界延长了一倍\"。\"很多人都指望着我们。\"",

However, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning emphasized that China and Russia are independent nations and that China did not create the Ukraine crisis. She reiterated China's commitment to peace and dialogue.\n\nStubb's comments reflect growing frustration among Ukraine's allies over China's perceived support for Russia, including providing military technology and helping Russia circumvent trade restrictions. Trade data shows an increase in China-Russia trade, while EU-Russia trade has decreased.\n\nStubb, who took office on March 1, 2023, argued that ending Russia's aggression in Ukraine would benefit China by upholding international rules on territorial integrity and sovereignty. He also called for increased European support for Ukraine, both militarily and politically, and urged Europe to transition to a \"wartime economy\" to support defense industries.\n\nStubb noted that Finland, which shares a long border with Russia and has a history of conflict and cautious coexistence with its neighbor, is now a crucial geopolitical player in Europe, especially after joining NATO in April 2023. Finland maintains a strong military capability, including one of Europe's most powerful artillery forces."

        "body": "一次性摧毁乌军5架苏-27，俄军给F-16打了一个下马威。根据俄国防部发布战报称，俄军发射\"伊斯坎德尔\"战术导弹，对乌东地区的米尔哥罗德机场，实施了集群式攻击。\"伊斯坎德尔\"导弹特别换装了集束弹头，穿透乌军防空网，击中5架苏-27战斗机。其中，2架被彻底摧毁，3架受损。有网友就纳闷了，打了2年多了，怎么乌军还有这么多苏-27？俄军能否击落F-16？今天，一林就跟大家聊一聊，F-16对决苏俄战机的不败金身，会不会被打破？\n\n苏联解体以后，乌克兰继承了大约77架苏-27战斗机。但因为乌克兰经济崩溃，军队腐败，到俄乌战前，能飞起来的苏-27，就只剩32架了。可神奇的是，就这么32架，俄乌战争打了2年多，居然没有被全部摧毁，这是怎么回事？其实，乌军拥有的苏-27所剩无几了，也就剩个10多架了，大部分都被击落了。这一次，被一次性摧毁5架，对乌克兰空军而言，是一个重大的噩耗。\n\n乌军之所以还能保留10多架苏-27，不是因为乌空军有多强大，而是长期采取龟缩战术。比如，俄军一天出动飞机30架次，乌军一天就只能出动一到两个架次。大部分时候，乌军的苏-27、米格-29、苏-24等战机，都是龟缩起来的，出勤率低，损失数量也就比较少了。毕竟，这是乌空军全部的家底了，打完就没了。\n\n俄军此次空袭选择的时机，也十分地微妙。因为F-16在乌东战场上，刚刚完成了首次攻击。但这次攻击，是一次试探性地攻击，并没有对俄军造成重大损失。可它意味着，从这一刻开始，F-16真真切切地被投入乌东战场了。俄军选择此时袭击乌军机场，就是要给F-16来一个下马威。考虑到俄空天军和防空系统的拉胯，很多人质疑，俄军可能无法击落F-16。这种质疑是完全没有必要的。\n\n俄乌战争，是冷战后，双方技术差距最小的一次大规模战争。只要F-16进入乌东，被击落就是迟早的事。任何武器都会有战损，关键在于，它能否得到及时地补充。早在2018年，胡塞武装就使用老旧的R-27空空导弹，从地面发射，精准击落了沙特两架F-15战斗机。沙特的F-15是土豪定制版，性能比美军自用的版本还要先进，而乌军的F-16是早期猴版。在没有技术代差的情况下，F-16想在乌东战场上，实现零损失，几乎是不可能的。\n\n而且，乌军接收的第一批F-16，数量太少了，只有4到6架。靠4到6架F-16，去争夺制空权，是不可能的。它的主要功能是发射AIM-120远程空空导弹，逼退俄军的苏-34战斗轰炸机。\n\n从5架苏-27被摧毁来看，乌军是没有能力保护好机场的。为了避免F-16刚参战，就被摧毁，乌克兰已经申请将F-16部署在邻国机场，包括波兰、捷克、斯洛伐克等。\n\n尽管俄军的S-300、S-400，实战表现不如预期，但过度神话F-16，只会让它更快地跌落神坛。",

        "summary": "In a recent military operation, Russian forces destroyed five Ukrainian Su-27 fighter jets using \"Iskander\" tactical missiles at the Mirgorod airport in Eastern Ukraine. This attack, which occurred amidst the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, is seen as a significant blow to the Ukrainian Air Force, which had only about 10-15 Su-27s remaining from an original fleet of 77 inherited after the Soviet Union's dissolution. The timing of the Russian strike is notable as it coincides with the initial deployment of F-16 fighter jets by Ukraine in the Eastern front, marking their first use in the conflict. The article suggests that despite the F-16's advanced capabilities, it is unlikely to achieve zero losses in the conflict due to the minimal technological gap between the opposing forces. Additionally, Ukraine has requested to station its F-16s in neighboring countries like Poland, Czech Republic, and Slovakia to protect them from immediate destruction. The article concludes that overestimating the F-16's invincibility could lead to its quicker downfall."

        "body": "其实放眼整个世界，在经济上，中国对于欧洲的重要性，要比欧洲对于中国的重要性要高。但是即便如此，欧盟还是和老美沆瀣一气，粗暴地对我们的电动汽车加征关税。\n\n详情请点击下面视频观看\n\n而且眼看着7月4日的期限即将临近，欧盟似乎也没有要回头的意思，毫无疑问，这会影响中欧之间的关系。\n\n欧盟的紧逼，应该要想到中国不会忍气吞声，必然会有所反击，而这也引发了不少人的担忧，因为有些人认为，中欧之间可能会因此而打起贸易战，当然这对双方而言都会带来不好的结果。\n\n对此，希腊前财政部长瓦鲁法基斯站了出来，替我们说了句公道话，表示让欧洲不要忘记了，16年前，如果不是中国伸出援手，或许在08年的全球金融危机中，欧洲也不可能如此快走出困境。\n\n那时候的中国，对于国内投资和对外贸易都作出了调整，虽然本质上是了促进本国的经济发展，但在这个过程中，中国也在一定程度上帮助了欧洲经济的复苏，比如说，当时的中国就进口非常多的德国产品，让许多本来已经濒临倒闭的德国企业\"起死回生\"。\n\n不仅如此，欧债危机时，中国也是\"出了一份力\"，不少的欧洲债券被中国买了去，可不能小瞧了这一步动作，这可是有助于让欧洲经济从低迷往上走的，从现在欧洲还流传着类似欧洲走出金融危机多得中国，就可以知晓，中国对欧洲而言，在当时的金融危机，是正面的形象，可以算得上是个大\"恩人\"。\n\n因此，欧盟针对中国的电动汽车，显然是非常粗暴，并且不合理的。\n\n而且瓦鲁法基斯还指出，欧盟不是一直在叫嚷着要绿色转型，但其实在这方面中国也是可以帮大忙的。\n\n过去欧洲想要进行绿色转型，但是在俄乌战争爆发后，由于对俄罗斯的经济制裁，让这个项目推进得十分艰难，甚至还有些倒退的意思，从不少国家再次让火力发电厂开始工作就知道了。\n\n不过尽管没了俄罗斯，但是我们还能和中国做贸易，毕竟在这方面，中国可是个强手，就说欧洲想要发展太阳能领域方面的吧，中国可以产出许多占据优势的关键部件，像这多晶硅以及晶圆等，不仅是质量上乘，而且价格也适中。\n\n还有这些年来，中国就和欧洲国家展开了合作，在绿色能源方面也取得了不错的成绩，比如和多个国家建设风电站等，都在一定程度让这些国家实现了节能减排。\n\n再说现在中国的新能源汽车本来就领先，而且性价还高，如果欧盟此时加征关税，毫无疑问，这会影响中国电动汽车在欧洲的销售，而欧洲本土的电动汽车又跟不上，而这也会冲击欧洲想要绿色转型的心思。\n\n因此，不少人也和瓦鲁法基斯有同样的想法，即便不是看在\"情谊\"上，中国曾经出手帮助过欧洲。也要在欧洲整体利益上来考量，如果欧盟粗暴地对中国挥起关税大棒，那么中国可能会反制，到时难免就会爆发贸易战，这显然对于欧洲的绿色转型没什么好处，而没了中国更具性价比的绿色能源方面的关键部件，欧盟想要走这条路也只会越发困难。\n\n对此，有网友认为，不要想太多了，美欧只会看重利益，不会有什么感恩之心的！\n\n欧盟之所以如此对待中国，其实就是老美的裹挟，从这也可以看出，欧盟的自主性与独立性就是个笑话。\n\n美欧炒作产能过剩简直就是双标，以前美欧产品进入中国就不是产能过剩，现在中国电动汽车进驻欧洲就是产能过剩。",

This decision is expected to strain China-EU relations, with potential repercussions including a trade war. Yanis Varoufakis, former Greek Finance Minister, criticized the EU's decision, reminding Europe of China's crucial support during the 2008 global financial crisis and the European debt crisis. He highlighted that China’s import of European goods and purchase of European bonds significantly aided Europe’s economic recovery.\n\nVaroufakis also pointed out that China could be a key partner in Europe’s green transition, especially in the solar energy sector, where China produces essential components like polysilicon and wafers. He argued that imposing tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles would hinder Europe’s green goals, as European electric vehicle production lags behind.\n\nThe article suggests that the EU’s actions are influenced by the United States and reflect a lack of autonomy. It criticizes the double standards of the US and EU, noting that while they previously benefited from exporting to China, they now label Chinese exports as overcapacity. The overall sentiment is that the EU’s tariff decision is counterproductive and could lead to negative consequences for both sides."

        "title": "2万朝鲜军队挽回不了败局，俄朝建立同盟是一步臭棋_手机网易网",
        "body": "这两天，有关两万名朝鲜士兵进入俄乌战场的消息刷屏。俄粉们乐坏了，纷纷称赞朝军\"意志坚定\"\"作风顽强\"\"吃苦耐劳\"\"战斗力惊人\"，仿佛这两万朝军一到，俄乌战事立马改观，俄罗斯就要取得胜利。\n\n这是哪跟哪啊？\n\n俄乌战争，不同于人类历史上的任何一次战争，同二次大战时的战争形态完全两样，主要依赖信息技术、无人机和导弹，小分队、单兵化网格战术，而不是靠人海战术。朝军在这方面，会比俄军强吗？俄军都打成这样，换上一个更落后的朝军，能起多大作用，肯定是一个问号？\n\n所以，还不如派下面这样的军队去，肯定能大幅度提高俄军的士气。\n\n当然，从成本角度来看，俄罗斯每年只需为这些朝鲜士兵支付1.15亿美元，相当于每人不到六千美元。与俄罗斯自身的征兵费用以及西方国家招募雇佣兵的开支相比，这个成本确实非常低廉。至于朝鲜，缺钱缺粮就是不缺人。拿这点人换这么多美元，还省了吃喝费用，当然也认为很合算。\n\n所以双方一拍即合。\n\n网上有一种说法，说此次朝军入俄是根据双方刚签署的《全面战略伙伴关系条约》，名正言顺，而美西方由于未能让乌克兰加入北约，无法直接派遣成建制的正规军参战，吃了一个哑巴亏，所以普京这一手段相当高明。\n\n普京访问朝鲜、双方签署战略同盟这件事，牵涉的层面很广，从来不是弹尽的一方和粮绝的一方资源互换就完事了，俄罗斯人付出的外交代价其实是很大的。当然，这一点，杜文龙李莉之流不会说，司马夹头或法西斯教授也不会帮着分析。\n\n从总体态势上讲，克里姆林宫负责人时隔24年访问朝鲜，是一种放低姿态求援的表现。为了弱化这一感观，俄罗斯人还煞费苦心安排俄罗斯总统访问越南，似乎这次出访走了两个国家，不只是专程拜访朝鲜一样。但俄罗斯人和越南人签署了一堆所谓的\"战略合作协议\"，战术落实基本为零，明眼人都能看出，去不去越南是根本无所谓的，越南也不会因为俄罗斯来访就跟美国疏远，所以访越就是表演的一部分而已。\n\n俄罗斯作为五常之一，是当年制裁朝鲜的当事方和赞成方，现在却又主动毁弃\"历史文件\"，率先跟朝鲜做生意，这让他们本来就几乎为零的国际信誉进一步遭受损失。在联合国这一战后最重要的国际政治和外交工具上，先失一分。泽连斯基多次公开、直接地表示，俄罗斯人根本不可信，现在俄罗斯的做法完全坐实了泽连斯基的说法。欧洲那些原先主张跟俄罗斯谈判的政治势力，将更加不得人心。支持泽连斯基和乌克兰的人会坚定支持的信念。\n\n对朝鲜来说，最重要的邻国并非俄罗斯。在地缘政治方面，无论朝鲜或俄罗斯，都不可能任性地开展合作，还一定要顾忌到其他国家的感观。朝鲜能给俄罗斯提供的无非就是弹药和人力，俄罗斯能给朝鲜的是什么呢？是军工科技。然而朝鲜半岛这个火药桶牵扯甚广，无论俄罗斯给朝鲜的是核技术，还是核武器运载技术，都将在事实上加剧半岛及周边国家的紧张和关切。原本朝鲜在最近的两年中就不断进行所谓的卫星发射试验，实质上是远程导弹试射，已经让日韩高度紧张，现在俄罗斯又传授火箭技术，让朝鲜导弹的成熟度和命中率大大提升，日韩会怎么想？韩国已经表明，将重新考虑不直接向乌克兰销售武器的禁令，而日本自开战以来，已向乌克兰提供总额为140亿美元的各种人道主义援助和预算援助。可见，俄罗斯染指半岛，必然导致日韩加大援助乌克兰的力度。\n\n朝鲜能给的只有库存弹药，可日韩作为发达国家，拥有强大的工业能力，能提供给乌克兰的东西可多了去了。所以，普京并不是打开了军火库从里面拿走炮弹，实际他打开的是潘多拉盒子，里面飞出来的东西有些是要送命的。虽然短期内会帮助他们获得更多库存炮弹和老旧导弹，但引发的地缘政治焦虑最终可能反而让乌克兰获得收益，从而抵消俄罗斯获得的援助的收益。另一方面，日韩紧张焦虑，必定会在外交和其他国际事务上更加紧跟美国。这方面大家都懂，就不多说了。\n\n综上，普京访朝、双方签署战略合作协议，看似是一步妙棋，两国都各取所需，但实际上是一步臭棋。更因为透支了太多未来，从长远看是一步死棋。俄罗斯之所以走到这一步，归根结底还是高估了自身军事实力，同时低估了乌克兰人的抵抗意志和西方阵营坚决支持乌克兰的决心，结果只能是加速自己的失败。",

        "summary": "In recent news, reports have emerged about 20,000 North Korean soldiers entering the Russia-Ukraine conflict, sparking excitement among Russian supporters who believe this could turn the tide in Russia's favor. However, the article argues that this is unlikely due to the modern nature of warfare, which relies heavily on technology rather than sheer manpower.\n\nThe deployment is seen as a result of a newly signed Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Treaty between Russia and North Korea. Economically, it is cost-effective for Russia, while North Korea benefits financially. However, this alliance has significant diplomatic repercussions. Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to North Korea, the first in 24 years, is viewed as a desperate plea for support, despite attempts to downplay it by also visiting Vietnam.\n\nThis move damages Russia's international credibility, especially as it previously supported sanctions against North Korea. It also validates Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's claims of Russia's unreliability, potentially strengthening Western support for Ukraine.\n\nFor North Korea, the alliance offers military technology from Russia, but it heightens regional tensions, particularly with South Korea and Japan. These countries may increase their support for Ukraine in response, counteracting any short-term military gains Russia might achieve.\n\nIn summary, the Russia-North Korea alliance, while seemingly beneficial in the short term, is deemed a strategic blunder with long-term negative consequences, exacerbating geopolitical tensions and undermining Russia's position."

Key points include:\n\n1. **Casualties and Military Losses**: The Russian military has suffered nearly 550,000 casualties, with 35,030 losses in June 2024 alone. The Ukrainian 47th Brigade has been particularly effective, killing 975 Russian soldiers in two weeks and repeatedly destroying the combat capabilities of Russian brigades.\n\n2. **Russian Recruitment and Morale**: Evidence suggests that Russian forces are depleting, with recruitment efforts intensifying in major cities like Saint Petersburg and Novosibirsk. Compensation for new recruits has increased significantly.\n\n3. **Military Equipment and Tactics**: Ukrainian forces have successfully destroyed advanced Russian artillery using drones. Russian forces are now primarily using infantry and artillery, with fewer armored units observed. Ukrainian drones have also targeted Russian fuel trains, indicating improved capabilities.\n\n4. **Crimea and Defensive Measures**: Russia has fortified Crimea with over 233 military bases and installed air defense systems in civilian areas, raising safety concerns. Ukrainian missile strikes on Sevastopol have prompted these defensive measures.\n\n5. **Frontline Dynamics**: In Kharkiv, Ukrainian forces are using precision bombs and drones to weaken Russian positions. In other regions like Sumy and Kherson, Ukrainian forces continue to target Russian bases and supply lines.\n\n6. **New Tactics**: Russian forces have resorted to using motorcycles for rapid movement and supply transport to avoid drone attacks, despite the high risks involved.\n\n7. **International Involvement**: Reports indicate that F-16 fighter jets, potentially accompanied by NATO aircraft, have been detected in Ukrainian airspace, with further deployments expected.\n\nThe article highlights the ongoing intensity and evolving tactics in the conflict, with significant implications for both military strategy and civilian safety in the affected regions."

        "body": "今日内容\n\n乌军精锐半月击毙两个营兵力 俄士兵快用光\n\n俄最先进火炮被毁 乌军无人机再创佳绩\n\n俄军吓破胆 紧急武装克里米亚\n\n航空炸弹突袭俄军 前线惊现摩托车冲锋\n\n聚焦战场动态，剖析地缘争端，欢迎收看新冷战情室，我是禹同。\n\n今天是2024年7月3日，俄乌战争进入第861天。\n\n乌军总参谋部发布最新数据显示，在2024年6月，1个月内俄军就损失共35030人。截至2024年7月1日，俄军在战场上的损失已经逼近55万人的大关。\n\n值得一提的是，乌军精锐第47旅正在波克罗夫斯克方向，与俄军的两个旅以及五个团交战，半个月内第47旅清理了975名俄军。并且在阿夫迪夫卡北翼长达8个月的激烈战斗中，乌军第47旅至少3次彻底摧毁了俄军第15旅和第30旅的作战能力。\n\n乌军指出，俄罗斯士兵不愿被俘虏，他们常会用轻武器或用手榴弹引爆自己，或让同伴解决自己。\n\n越来越多的证据表明，俄军的士兵快要用光了。现在俄罗斯的征兵广告牌已经出现在圣彼得堡、新西伯利亚等俄罗斯大城市。为了招募新兵，当局将新兵补偿金提高到130万卢布。与两年前的20万卢布相比，增长了650%。而且在这些城市中，现在经常出现送丧的人，以及佩戴假肢的退役人员，这种情况以前是没有的。\n\n俄最先进火炮被毁 乌军无人机再创佳绩\n\n目前，战场上俄军主要以步兵成群结队的方式发起攻击，炮兵持续不懈地进行轰击。最近很少见到装甲纵队的活动，但预计俄军很快可能会再次集结大量装甲部队发起进攻。\n\n在阿夫迪夫卡的斯特波韦村（Stepove）乌军第109旅发现了刚刚抵达射击阵地的俄军2S19型自行榴弹炮，随后乌军就用无人机和FPV迅速将其摧毁。\n\n据悉，俄军几乎将仅剩的最多和最先进的装备集结在波克罗夫斯克方向，但进展却微乎其微。\n\n近日，乌克兰第56独立机械化旅的一支Roniny无人机在扎波罗热州的托克马克（Tokamak）附近，击中了运送燃油的俄罗斯列车。\n\n目前尚不清楚无人机击中这款2TE116型内燃机车后的战果，因为无人机爆炸后就不再能够传回图像。《国防快报》指出，这次袭击出现在距离前线20-30公里内的区域，乌克兰无人机在这里击中移动目标，说明其技术又提高了。另外，运油列车的出现，说明俄军正在积极开发从顿巴斯到克里米亚的\"铁路走廊\"，当然，这也将成为乌克兰FPV无人机重点打击的目标。\n\n另一边，俄军的袭击也在继续，7月1日，在俄军无人机的配合下，俄军用伊斯坎德尔导弹袭击了乌克兰迈尔戈罗德空军基地。有俄罗斯博主声称至少有3架F-16被摧毁。\n\n乌克兰空军官员尤里·伊格纳特（Yury Ignat）承认，迈尔戈罗德空军基地遭到了导弹袭击。卫星图像显示，俄军至少摧毁1架Su-27飞机，还有几架其他型号的飞机受损，但是这个机场并没有F-16。\n\n有分析认为，乌军将无防护的Su-27战机露天放置在伊斯坎德尔导弹的射程内，更像是一种迷惑俄军的策略，可能是希望以此来消耗俄军的导弹。因为如果这些飞机处于正常状态，应该加满航空燃料，随时准备起飞。但有消息指出，这些飞机可能是无法飞行的Su-27备件，已经停在机场很久，缺乏任何伪装和防空措施。\n\n提到F-16不得不说一下，俄媒已经报导称，在赫尔松上空雷达首次发现乌军F-16战机并有北约预警机伴飞，不过双方没有交火。\n\n荷兰国防部长奥隆格伦日前更表示，两架F-16战斗机将前往乌克兰。它们可以在任何地方使用，包括俄罗斯境内。看样子F-16很快就要正式亮相了\n\n俄军吓破胆 紧急武装克里米亚\n\n7月1日，乌军导弹袭击了克里米亚的塞瓦斯托波尔，俄军称击落所有导弹，但俄军后勤基地疑似被击中，损失仍在澄清。\n\n屡遭突袭的俄军，现在就如\"惊弓之鸟\"，7月1日，他们在塞瓦斯托波尔海滩旁安装了Tor M2KM地对空导弹系统。\n\n这一举动很大程度会危及当地百姓的安全，因为，地对空导弹系统本身就是一个高价值的军事目标，容易吸引敌方的攻击。而且在紧急情况下，导弹系统可能会错误识别并攻击非军事目标，会对附近的居民和基础设施造成意外伤害。另外，辐射和爆炸危险也可能出现。\n\n另外，俄罗斯已将克里米亚变成了一个戒备森严的地区，设置超过233个军事基地，并利用平民作为人盾。尽管实行了军事化，俄罗斯仍然鼓励旅游业，这将平民置于危险之中，并违反了国际法。\n\n由于几天前的一颗导弹击中了克里米亚海滨度假圣地，造成上百人伤亡，乌克兰随后暂停了几天对克里米亚的袭击。乌克兰军事专家罗曼·斯维坦（Roman Svitan）接受采访时表示，暂停的这几天，让俄罗斯人有机会重新集结，分散防空系统并将其转移到新的位置。\n\n斯维坦认为，乌军不应有任何顾忌，为了摧毁岛上的俄军防空系统，必须保持高强度的打击，最好每天进行一次。因为俄军需要1.5至2天的时间才能将防空系统从一个地方转移到另一个地方，持续的打击可以削弱其调动防空系统来保护自己的能力。\n\n外界认为，克里米亚的防空系统一旦耗尽，乌克兰的F-16，甚至登陆部队都可能打击克里米亚。\n\n航空炸弹突袭俄军 前线惊现摩托车冲锋\n\n在哈尔科夫地区，乌军使用高精度炸弹、各种火炮和无人机猛烈打击俄军，迫使俄军不得不抽调部队增援。乌军向哈尔科夫派遣了数万士兵，数量明显多于俄军，但并未发起猛攻。有分析认为，乌军是想通过持续消耗俄军的兵力来达成目的。哈尔科夫战役将成为俄军的鸡肋。\n\n有消息显示，俄军突击小组进入乌克兰苏梅地区试图制造新的热点，但俄军的集结点直接被乌军发射JDAM炸弹摧毁。可见在苏梅挑衅也不会有好结果。\n\n赫尔松地区，乌军用导弹袭击赫尔松地区左岸新卡霍夫卡的俄军基地，发生数次爆炸后引发火灾，损失程度目前还不清楚。\n\n巴赫穆特战区，乌克兰空军战机使用高精度AASM-250\"铁锤\"航空炸弹，轰炸了北郊帕拉斯科维夫卡的俄军聚点，收获不小。\n\n不过，目前驻防在高层建筑区域内的乌军正在遭受俄军TOS-2的猛烈轰炸。俄军的TOS-2搭配220mm火箭弹，内部装填的是燃烧极为强烈的三乙基铝。这种药剂不仅可以在空气中自燃，而且遇水还会发生爆炸。对人体皮肤具有强腐蚀性，即使被埋在土中也能继续燃烧，乌军的伤亡估计不小。\n\n乌克兰霍尔蒂察岛联合特遣部队发言人纳扎尔·沃洛申（Nazar Voloshyn）在7月1日的电视直播中指出，俄军现在正在霍尔利夫卡-托列茨克（Horlivka-Toretsk）方向猛攻，对恰索夫亚尔的攻势正在减弱。\n\n沃洛申指出，俄罗斯进攻托列茨克的目的是想从另一个方向对恰西夫亚尔施加压力。\n\n也有分析认为，俄军对托列茨克的进攻是因为在恰西夫亚尔的伤亡过大，士兵厌战，因此换个地方继续消耗战。\n\n外界还观察到，俄军为了躲避乌军无人机的袭击，开始使用摩托车向前线运送弹药，并在前线发起了摩托车冲锋。7月1日，乌克兰第72旅在武莱达尔摧毁了一次俄军的摩托车冲锋袭击。这或许表明俄军的装备状况日益恶化。\n\n《南德日报》通过AI模型检查了87个俄罗斯军事基地的卫星图像，包括16个存放坦克、火炮和装甲运兵车的基地。结果显示，自2022年2月24日以来，俄罗斯的装甲战车数量大幅减少。\n\n《纽约时报》报导，摩托车冲锋这一新战术在前线蔓延开来，为战斗增添了更多的混乱和残酷。俄军试图利用摩托车的速度优势穿越空地，以适应布满地雷和无人机的战场环境。虽然这种战术风险极大，但它解决了在无人机和炮火监视下穿越空地的关键挑战。\n\n乌克兰第47机械化旅的Sapsan中士表示：\"他们抵近后会跳下车开始射击......这些越野车和摩托车速度很快。\"虽然这种战术导致了俄军的巨大伤亡，但确实在突破无人机和炮火封锁方面取得了一些成功。\n\n好的，今天的新冷战情室就到这儿了，关注我们，聚焦战场动态，剖析地缘争端，精彩尽在新冷战情室！\n\n====================\n\n大家好，我是《新冷战情室》主持人。\n\n喜欢我们的频道，欢迎点赞，订阅，评论，并开启小铃铛🔔就可在第一时间观看精彩内容哦〜\n\n●干净世界《新冷战情室》订阅频道\n\nhttps://www.ganjing.com/zh-TW/channel/1f0pfr9iea8dLmIA3dw0Nuyyd12m0c\n\n●《新冷战情室》订阅频道\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkCfjd8aOsJHdpgj6FD9L1w (文章仅代表作者个人立场和观点)\n\n焦点\"乌克兰危机\n\n来源:看中国视频 --版权所有，任何形式转载需看中国授权许可。严禁建立镜像网站.\n\n欢迎给您喜欢的作者捐助。您的爱心鼓励就是对我们媒体的耕耘。\n\n本文短网址：\n\n相似文章： 換一批\n\n換一批\n\n读者推荐： 換一批\n\n換一批\n\n读者喜欢： 換一批\n\n換一批\n\n1\n\n新一期特刊已经发表\n\n请荣誉会员登陆下载\n\n会员\n\n1\n\n新一期特刊已经发表\n\n请荣誉会员登陆下载\n\n【诚征荣誉会员】溪流能够汇成大海，小善可以成就大爱。我们向全球华人诚意征集万名荣誉会员：每位荣誉会员每年只需支付一份订阅费用，成为《看中国》网站的荣誉会员，就可以助力我们突破审查与封锁，向至少10000位中国大陆同胞奉上独立真实的关键资讯，在危难时刻向他们发出预警，救他们于大瘟疫与其它社会危难之中。\n\n来源:看中国视频\n\n关键字搜索： 俄乌战争 普京 俄军 乌军 俄罗斯 乌克兰 克里米亚",

Both officials discussed Ukraine's aspirations to join NATO, with Austin supporting this goal and mentioning steps to facilitate Ukraine's membership. The aid package includes anti-tank weapons and air defense interceptors, accelerating the procurement of NASAMS and Patriot missile systems. Since 2022, the U.S. has provided over $50 billion in military aid to Ukraine. However, future support may be uncertain if Donald Trump wins the upcoming presidential election, as his advisors propose that further U.S. weapons aid should be contingent on Ukraine engaging in peace talks with Russia, a stance that could face opposition from European allies and within the Republican Party."

        "summary": "A major European poll indicates that most European countries now believe negotiations are the best way to end the Russia-Ukraine war, rather than a complete military victory for Ukraine. On July 2, 2024, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv to consider a ceasefire to expedite peace talks. Zelensky did not respond directly but highlighted potential bilateral cooperation between Ukraine and Hungary. A poll by the European Council on Foreign Relations in May 2024 showed limited belief in a total Ukrainian military victory, with most Europeans supporting aid to Ukraine to strengthen its negotiating position rather than to achieve outright victory. The poll revealed varied opinions across Europe, with countries like Estonia, Sweden, and Poland showing more support for Ukraine's military efforts, while Italy, Greece, and Bulgaria were less supportive. The findings underscore the challenge for Western leaders in reconciling differing views on how to end the conflict."

        "body": "北约（NATO）正在准备乌克兰\"B计划\"来保障对基辅当局的援助。（图片来源：Oleg Nikishin/Getty Images）\n\n【看中国2024年7月3日讯】（看中国记者闻天清编译/综合报导）随着美国总统候选人川普重返白宫的可能性增加，北约（NATO）正在准备乌克兰\"B计划\"来保障对基辅当局的援助。美国媒体披露，川普的幕僚正在策划一项\"彻底重新定位\"北约的计划，让欧洲占主导地位，美国退居二线。\n\nPolitico曝光川普彻底重新定位北约计划\n\n7月2日，美国政治新闻网站Politico称，美国总统候选人川普多次批评北约成员国没有公平承担军费，因此外界在关注他若再次当选美国总统，何时会放弃这个有75年历史的北大西洋公约联盟。然而，通过对川普前国家安全官员和可能在川普第二任期总统任职的国防专家的采访，川普不太可能彻底退出北约，但会持续要求欧洲成员国大幅增加军费支出。\n\n在接受采访时，熟悉川普国家安全顾问圈内部想法的国防专家丹·考德威尔（Dan Caldwell）说：\"我们真的别无选择。\"他列举了美国国家债务不断上升、军事人员招募乏力，以及美国国防工业薄弱的基础无法应对莫斯科和北京当局的挑战。\n\n川普和他的总统竞选团队尚未任命新的国家安全团队，也没有公开接受北约的新议程。不过，川普竞选团队内部正持续就相关议题进行讨论。接受采访的前官员和专家表示，若是川普胜选，在第二个美国总统任期内，美国将保留其在德国、英国和土耳其的空中力量和基地以及海军力量，来维持对欧洲的核保护伞。于此同时，大部分步兵、装甲、后勤和火炮最终将转交给欧洲国家。\n\n卡尔德威尔表示，这种转变将涉及\"明显实质性大幅缩减美国的安全角色，不是欧洲战斗力的主要提供者，只在危机时刻提供支持。\"\n\n川普团队计划的另一部分是北约两级体系（two-tier NATO system）。这个想法首先是由另一位前川普政府高级官员、退役陆军中将基思·凯洛格（Keith Kellogg）提出的，这意味着尚未实现将GDP的2%用于国防预算的目标的北约成员国将无法得到美国的国防安全保证。\n\n尽管北约第5条规定，一旦确认任何一个成员国遭受攻击，则视为针对全体成员国的攻击，其他成员国需作出即时反应。对此，川普外交政策智库成员称，北约第5条的措词很灵活，并未要求任何成员国必须以军事武力作出回应。\n\n迄今为止，美国是军事联盟北约的最大贡献者，其国防预算约8600亿美元，占2023年北约国防预算总额的68%。泛欧智库\"欧洲外交关系委员会\"（The European Council on Foreign Relations，ECFR）研究主任杰里米·夏皮罗（Jeremy Shapiro）表示，美国国防预算（约占美国GDP的3.5%）很大一部分用于保卫欧洲，尽管五角大楼拒绝公开透露具体金额。\n\n川普政府时期美国国务院政策规划办公室主任、\"2025规划\"（Project 2025）的关键人物基隆‧斯金纳（Kiron Skinner）说：\"美国不是世界的提款机（ATM），北约可以在大西洋战区和印太战区发挥重要作用，但我们需要进行更多的战略思考。\"\n\n川普的北约新政策计划也可能在迅速解决持续2年半的俄乌战争中发挥关键作用，他认为\"这是一场根本不该开始的战争\"。这位共和党总统候选人正在考虑与俄罗斯总统普京达成协议，决定哪些国家可以加入北约达成协议，特别是乌克兰和格鲁吉亚。这将对北约关于未来乌克兰的模糊承诺产生重大影响，拜登政府执行这项承诺，但这一承诺没有时间表。\n\n据一位不愿透露姓名的熟悉川普想法的国家安全专家称，川普\"对阻止北约扩张的事情持开放态度，也不会回到1991年的乌克兰边界。这将摆在桌面上。但这并不意味着放弃任何其它可能性，包括向乌克兰提供大量武器。\"\n\n北约正在为乌克兰准备B计划\n\n7月1日，美国《华尔街日报》引述未透露姓名的美国和北约盟国官员消息称，7月9日至7月11日在美国华盛顿特区举行峰会期间，北约将宣布几项新措施，以应对川普重返白宫后对北约支持乌克兰政策的冲击。\n\n报道称，北约正计划采取新措施来保护对乌克兰的支持。该计划已经进行了数月，由于拜登在美国总统选举首场辩论中表现不佳，目前正在加速进行中。北约采取的措施包括该军事联盟向乌克兰首都基辅派驻一名新的高级文官，在德国西部城市威斯巴登（Wiesbaden）建立一个新的军事指挥部，以协调北约成员国对乌克兰军队的军事援助和训练。\n\n德国威斯巴登新军事指挥部计划被称为\"北约对乌克兰的安全援助和培训\"（NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine），由来自所有北约成员国约700名美国和盟国人员组成。\n\n川普几乎没有掩饰他对北约盟国的失望，一再批评北约盟国利用美国在欧洲的安全援助，并且没有履行北约国防预算（GDP2%）得承诺。2014年，北约成员国同意将GDP的2%用于国防预算，但许多国家都未能实现这一目标。\n\n路透社报导，近年来，北约盟国的国防预算引起了很大争议，特别是美国前总统川普批评欧洲盟国在自身国家安全方面支出太少，并依赖美国的保护。今年早些时候，美国共和党总统候选人川普暗示，他不会保护那些在国防预算不到GDP2%的北约盟国。\n\n6月17日，北约秘书长斯托尔滕贝格在白宫与美国总统拜登会晤时说，5年前，北约实现国防预算至少为2%GDP目标的盟国数量不到10个。他强调了自2014年俄罗斯从乌克兰手中夺取克里米亚半岛以来，北约盟国如何增加持续军费开支。\n\n斯托尔滕贝格说：\"在欧洲和加拿大，今年北约盟国的国防预算增幅达到18%，这是几十年来的最大增幅，23个盟国今年的军费将占GDP的2%或更高。\"\n\n北约秘书长斯托尔滕贝格表示，当北约领导人在2014年峰会上设定军费占GDP2%的目标时，只有美国、希腊和英国3个盟国达到了这个目标。当时的北约有28个盟国，现在增至32个盟国。\n\n斯托尔滕贝格早些时候在威尔逊中心智库发表讲话时表示，北约盟国增加国防开支\"对欧洲和美国都有好处，特别是因为这些额外资金大部分都花在了美国。\"\n\n北约进行核武部署谈判\n\n英国《每日电讯报》（The Daily Telegraph）6月报道，北约秘书长斯托尔滕贝格在接受该媒体采访时称，面对莫斯科和北京日益严重的威胁，北约正在针对部署更多核武问题进行谈判，并将这些核武处于待命状态。\n\n托尔滕贝格说：\"我不会详细讨论应该有多少核弹头可以使用，以及应该储存哪些核弹头，但我们需要就这些核武问题进行磋商。这是我们正在做的事情。透明度有助于传达这样的直接讯息：我们（北约）是一个核武联盟。\"\"北约的目标当然是一个没有核武的世界，但只要核武存在，我们就将继续是一个核武联盟，因为俄罗斯、中国和朝鲜拥有核武。如果北约没有核武的话，那么这个世界将是一个更加危险的世界。\"\n\n此前，斯托尔滕贝格表示，核武是北约的\"最终安全保证\"和维护和平的方式，是威慑力量。\n\n北约在协调向基辅的武器援助方面发挥了更大的作用，但很少公开谈论核武，尽管美国已在欧洲多个地点部署了核武。据美国科学家联合会称，俄罗斯和美国是迄今为止世界上最大的核国家，拥有世界上约88%的核武。\n\n根据《原子科学家公报》（Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists）消息，美国在意大利、德国、土耳其、比利时和荷兰这5个欧洲国家部署了约100颗非战略B61核武。美国境内还有另外100件此类核武。\n\n俄罗斯拥有约1558颗非战略核弹头。不过，军控专家表示，由于是军事机密，很难推测俄罗斯到底有多少颗核弹头。\n\n记者\"闻天清\n\n来源:看中国 --版权所有，任何形式转载需看中国授权许可。 严禁建立镜像网站.\n\n欢迎给您喜欢的作者捐助。您的爱心鼓励就是对我们媒体的耕耘。\n\n本文短网址：\n\n相似文章： 換一批\n\n換一批\n\n读者推荐： 換一批\n\n換一批\n\n读者喜欢： 換一批\n\n換一批\n\n1\n\n新一期特刊已经发表\n\n请荣誉会员登陆下载\n\n会员\n\n1\n\n新一期特刊已经发表\n\n请荣誉会员登陆下载\n\n【诚征荣誉会员】溪流能够汇成大海，小善可以成就大爱。我们向全球华人诚意征集万名荣誉会员：每位荣誉会员每年只需支付一份订阅费用，成为《看中国》网站的荣誉会员，就可以助力我们突破审查与封锁，向至少10000位中国大陆同胞奉上独立真实的关键资讯，在危难时刻向他们发出预警，救他们于大瘟疫与其它社会危难之中。\n\n来源:看中国\n\n关键字搜索： 北约 川普 乌克兰 美国 基辅 欧洲 国防预算 GDP 核武",

        "body": "俄乌战争第861天（2024年7月3日），先来看看欧尔班访问基辅后续。\n\n7月2日，匈牙利总理欧尔班访问基辅，提出加深双边关系、参与乌克兰现代化建设、协助乌克兰政府，提供人道主义援助等。\n\n欧尔班此举更像是下注乌克兰，为匈牙利赢得最大利益。\n\n有意思的是欧尔班重申支持泽连斯基的和平倡议，不反对乌克兰采取的停战措施，但这些措施耗时太长，可以先停火再谈判。\n\n欧尔班还强调他并不坚持自己的倡议，并接受乌克兰的理由，一切取决于乌克兰。\n\n可以看出，欧尔班此次访问除了加深双边关系，下注乌克兰，还试探性劝降，以讨好俄罗斯。\n\n欧尔班试图两边下注，为匈牙利攫取利益，又倾向于利益更大的乌克兰一方，只能说趋势很清晰了。\n\n7月1日晚间，乌军用导弹袭击克里米亚塞瓦斯托波尔的黑海舰队758后勤支援中心仓库，至少90架Shahed 136无人机被摧毁。\n\n据称，S-400防空系统也被击中，详细信息仍有待澄清。\n\n7月2日，乌军袭击俄罗斯库尔斯克的俄军第3754航空技术基地 (VCH 13830)，俄军未透露损失。\n\n同一时刻，乌克兰无人艇袭击俄罗斯克拉斯诺达尔边疆区新罗西斯克港，摧毁俄军防空系统、雷达、基地的战略还在持续。\n\n一旦这些都被摧毁，对乌克兰意味着将大有可为。\n\n来看看战场最新消息，哈尔科夫地区，有报道称，俄军从哈尔科夫撤出部分部队，将其派往顿涅茨克地区发动攻势，战争研究所（ISW）也证实俄军正在顿涅茨克集结发动新攻势。\n\n俄军东一榔头西一棒槌，不断寻找乌军薄弱点试图推进，但代价很大。\n\n乌军继续向利博克（Hlyboke）、斯塔里齐亚（Starytsia）、沃夫昌斯克反击。\n\n俄军在这里并不具备优势，随着战斗持续，损失进一步增加。\n\n阿夫迪夫卡地区、马林卡-新海利夫卡地区，俄军试图继续向西推进，以拉平战线。\n\n阿夫迪夫卡与巴赫穆特之间的舒梅（Shumy）方向，这里的战斗已经持续数年，俄军推进有限。\n\n巴赫穆特地区，俄军继续围攻恰西夫亚尔，试图在卡利尼夫卡、微区、运河方向取得进展，但遭到乌军阻击。\n\n从趋势看，俄军不计代价缓慢前进，直到夺取整个顿涅茨克，这代价将非常高。\n\n扎波罗热地区，乌军夺回乌罗扎因中部地区。\n\n赫尔松地区，俄军进攻克林基被击退，乌军努力扩大这个区域的存在。\n\n库皮扬斯克-克雷明纳-莱曼地区，乌军从特尔尼、托尔斯克、佩尔绍特拉夫涅韦（Pershotravneve）等方向进攻并取得进展。\n\n亚速旅还进攻迪布罗瓦以南的森林区域，一点点向前推进。\n\n俄军从多个方向发起攻击，进展不大，损失不小。\n\n7月3日，乌克兰发布俄军损失数据，俄军每天千人以上的损失，代价可不低。\n\n7月2日，乌克兰最高拉达国家安全委员会委员伊夫琴科称，首批F-16将于本月抵达。\n\n他补充说：\"我认为，它们最初将用于防御敌方导弹，而不是瞄准俄罗斯境内的地点。\"\n\n这是乌克兰首次公开承认F-16即将抵达，俄罗斯不断袭击乌克兰可能停放F-16战机的机场也是为阻止F-16抵达。\n\nF-16具备公路起降能力，停放机场和配备的武器还未公开，可以肯定的是AIM-120空空导弹、瑞典ASC 890预警机都将为F-16战机提供支持。\n\n丹麦、挪威、荷兰和比利时计划2024年夏天向乌克兰移交60多架F-16战机，而总数是95架。\n\nF-16战机的目标应该是投掷FAB炸弹的俄军飞机和导弹，至于首秀将很快到来。\n\n在7月份北约峰会上，北约将提出一个替代乌克兰加入北约的方案，即\"新瑞典\"模式。\n\n该方案规定在没有正式成员资格的情况下，双方可以在安全和防务领域进行密切合作。\n\n而且每年向乌克兰提供400亿欧元的援助也将被讨论。\n\n北约还计划在德国威斯巴登设立一个新的指挥部，负责协调向乌方提供军事装备和训练乌军人员的工作。这项行动名为\"北约乌克兰安全援助与培训\"，将由来自32国联盟的近700名美国和其他盟国人员组成。\n\n北约还准备向乌克兰派遣常驻高级官员以确保对乌克兰的武器供应在任何情况下都不会停止\n\n所有一切表明，欧盟主席冯德莱恩、欧洲委员会秘书长贝尔塞、欧盟外交政策负责人卡拉斯、北约候任秘书长吕特，都会加强对乌克兰的援助。\n\n即使特朗普赢得美国大选、右翼势力赢得欧洲大选也不会影响乌克兰。\n\n美国国务卿布林肯宣布，加强乌克兰防空的新措施将在7月9日至11日在举行的北约峰会之前公布。\n\n7月2日，美国国防部长奥斯汀宣布，将很快向乌克兰提供23亿美元军事援助，包括更多防空拦截器、反坦克武器和其他弹药，以及为乌克兰采购更多爱国者、NASAMS防空系统。\n\n奥斯汀在社交媒体表示：\"毫无疑问，乌克兰并不孤单。\"\n\n7月3日，美国助理国务卿詹姆斯·奥布莱恩表示，如果俄罗斯试图扩大现有战线，乌克兰将能够发动更远距离的打击。\n\n目前，美国将乌克兰只能在距离边境100公里的区域内使用美国武器，乌克兰多次要求欧美国取消限制。\n\n7月2日，俄罗斯罗斯托夫的火车站，大量T-62M坦克正被运往乌克兰。\n\n俄军开始在乌克兰战场使用BMP/BMD-1装甲车上的73毫米滑膛炮自制的火炮攻击乌军阵地。\n\n加上大量摩托车、滑板车，高尔夫球车的使用，足以说明，俄军的资源并不是无限的。\n\n7月2日，佩斯科夫回答媒体提问时表示，俄罗斯\"仍愿意\"与乌克兰进行和谈，对通过第三方谈判持开放态度。\n\n乌克兰最大的问题是坚持861天，至今不投降，让俄罗斯正迅速耗尽资源，深陷其中。\n\n至今，泽连斯基没有表现出放弃领土换取和平的任何举动，乌克兰人也没有投降的想法，战斗到底，直至赢得胜利是大多数乌克兰人的选择。\n\n正如布林肯解释如何看待乌克兰的胜利，\"什么是成功？这就是乌克兰，一个强大、成功的国家，日益与西方融合，一个在军事、经济和民主上都能自立的国家。\"\n\n乌克兰的胜利并非遥不可及，一切终将值得，祝福乌克兰。",

Orbán expressed support for Ukrainian President Zelensky's peace initiatives but suggested a ceasefire before negotiations.\n\n2. **Military Actions**: \n   - Ukrainian forces attacked a Russian Black Sea Fleet logistics center in Sevastopol, Crimea, destroying at least 90 Shahed 136 drones and possibly hitting an S-400 air defense system.\n   - Ukrainian forces also targeted a Russian airbase in Kursk and a port in Novorossiysk, damaging Russian military infrastructure.\n   - In various regions, including Kharkiv, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson, both Ukrainian and Russian forces continued to engage in heavy fighting with significant losses on both sides.\n\n3. **Military Aid**: \n   - The first batch of F-16 fighter jets is confirmed to arrive in Ukraine this month, primarily for defensive purposes.\n   - The U.S. announced an additional $2.3 billion in military aid to Ukraine, including air defense systems and anti-tank weapons.\n\n4. **NATO and EU Support**: \n   - NATO plans to propose a \"New Sweden\" model for Ukraine, allowing close security cooperation without formal membership.\n   - A new NATO command center in Wiesbaden, Germany, will coordinate military support and training for Ukraine.\n   - The EU and NATO leaders, including Ursula von der Leyen and Jens Stoltenberg, are committed to continued support for Ukraine.\n\n5. **Russian Military Movements**: \n   - Russia is transporting T-62M tanks to Ukraine and using improvised artillery, indicating resource constraints.\n   - Russia remains open to negotiations but faces significant resource depletion due to the prolonged conflict.\n\n6. **U.S. Position**: \n   - U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken emphasized Ukraine's right to self-defense and the goal of a strong, independent Ukraine integrated with the West.\n\nThese developments highlight ongoing military engagements, significant international support for Ukraine, and the strategic complexities faced by both sides in the conflict."

Trump is reportedly negotiating with Russian President Vladimir Putin on how much Ukrainian land Moscow can retain. Two national security experts connected to Trump indicated that the plan involves NATO not expanding eastward, particularly not into Ukraine and Georgia. Trump aims to significantly increase European contributions to NATO and make substantial adjustments to the alliance. Although U.S. law prevents a president from unilaterally withdrawing from NATO, Trump plans to reform it. His advisors suggest that Trump would reduce aid to Ukraine to force it into peace talks, resulting in territorial concessions. Russia is betting on Trump's return to the White House, especially as President Biden faces health issues. Meanwhile, Europe and NATO are developing new mechanisms to continue supporting Ukraine, anticipating potential disruptions from Trump's possible re-election and the rise of right-wing parties in Europe."

        "summary": "North Korean leader Kim Jong-un visited a military factory following the conclusion of the 10th plenary meeting of the 8th Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, as reported by the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on Wednesday. During his visit, Kim emphasized the need to modernize production processes across all economic sectors. He inspected unmanned production lines and urged the integration of advanced production management systems. Kim also visited a machinery factory and a medical equipment factory.\n\nThe plenary meeting, which Kim chaired, began on June 28 and lasted four days, reviewing the country's economic performance in the first half of the year. Kim noted a positive economic trend and aimed to extend military production advancements to other sectors.\n\nExperts suggest that North Korea's push to modernize its military industry is not only to bolster its defense capabilities but also to capitalize on opportunities arising from the Russia-Ukraine war. Kim's recent visits to military enterprises, including multiple inspections in May, underscore this strategy."

        "title": "中国陆权突破迎来千载良机！_手机网易网",
        "body": "这两天，中国正在哈萨克斯坦访问，不知各位看到了什么，作者看到的是\"中国陆权突破迎来千载良机\"。\n\n一直以来，中国的权力伸缩受到两大障碍：\n\n其一，向东的海权发展受到美国舰队及其构筑的岛链阻碍。这个都知道，无须多说；\n\n其二，向西则是中国的陆权发展受到俄罗斯的地域拦阻。\n\n中国要延伸自身陆权，就必然要穿越中亚，然而俄罗斯掌控着中亚一直不肯放开，这其实就拦阻了中国陆权延伸。典型代表就是自1997年就开始构想的中吉乌铁路一直未能如愿，直到27年后的今天才有所进展，原因正在于毛熊。\n\n虽然有中欧班列，但路线基本都要通过俄罗斯领土，很容易被卡住。\n\n中国当然也可以强行突破，与毛熊争夺中亚影响力，但在当前美国是主要对手，在中俄需要联手破敌的局势下，与俄交恶显然并不明智。\n\n其实，不光是俄罗斯。向南印度也不愿看到中国陆权发展，所以不但利用自身版图，也利用美国占领时的阿富汗在积极向北经营。\n\n虽然阿富汗是一个弱乱之地，但它也是一个战略要地。英国、前苏联及美国都入侵过阿富汗，原因就在于它的战略位置非常重要，向北可以阻拦苏俄经中亚南下，向南则可虎视印度，向西可以扼守伊朗中东，向东则可以拦阻中国。美国曾万里迢迢去侵占阿富汗，并非吃饱了没事干。\n\n正因为上述局势，长期以来中国向西的陆权突破不太容易，很大程度上只有\"中国 -- -- 巴基斯坦 -- -- 伊朗\"这一条裂缝，还不时受到美印支持的恐怖组织干扰。\n\n不过时间来到如今，一切都在变了。\n\n美国出于战略收缩，奥巴马时代便开始从中东撤军，致使中东不断出现权力真空，使得中东受美国掌控不断减弱。2021年美国又从阿富汗撤军，这为中国的陆权突破奠定了初步机遇。\n\n2022年，俄乌战争爆发，它为中亚带来了两个影响。其一是俄罗斯因为俄乌战争不得不逐渐放开中亚，出于利益交换，也由于战争中的大毛对中亚掌控力减弱；其二，俄乌战争也让中亚颇为惊惧，因为中亚知道，毛熊今天能吞乌克兰，明天就能吞掉它们，所以中亚各国也必须寻求更多的外部力量来平衡俄罗斯影响力，从而减小乃至摆脱俄罗斯控制。\n\n同时，未被美国占领的阿富汗，印度想要染指也更加困难，中间还受到巴基斯坦的阻隔就更难。\n\n这些局势，就为中国向西的陆权突破创造了千载良机。如果不是俄乌战争让俄罗斯放开中亚，若是美国继续占领着阿富汗，中国要想向西突破恐怕依旧不容易。\n\n正是这种良机，搞了27年始终搞不定的中吉乌铁路终于在今年达成了，\"中国 -- -- 中亚 -- -- 中东\"的合作不断推进加深，中国这两天访问哈萨克斯坦，不出意外的话应该会有不少成果，比如开放更多中哈口岸什么的。\n\n一旦中国的陆地发展不受阻碍，经中亚、阿富汗与巴基斯坦，便能直通中东、北非、南欧及整个欧洲，大利。如下图\n\n应该说，一场俄乌战争给我们带来了不少收益，原本阻拦的中亚现在不断放开了，一直搞不成的中吉乌铁路如今达成了，远东也在适当放开，图门江出海口已见黎明......\n\n仅仅要注意的，是防止毛熊祸水东引。\n\n作者一直有个感觉，毛熊似乎在等待中美直接干起来，这样它将实现扩充了版图还能解套。早前它打乌克兰一直打得漫不经心，估计就是在等待这一机遇，直到佩洛西窜台后，看到中美没干起来才打得认真。如今毛熊似乎又在观望中美在菲律宾、台海这些地带过招。\n\n还有，毛熊前不久访问朝鲜，还结成同盟并让北朝出兵，要防止由此牵动韩国并进一步牵出美国与北约或亚太小北约，并最终激化半岛局势，一旦半岛有事，中国也就难以置身事外。当中美直接对阵，毛熊将自动解套，还会被美国拉拢。防范毛熊祸水东引，这是我们要注意的。\n\n总之，只要中国能保持战略定力，能压制周边战火不累及自身，当俄罗斯陷在乌克兰，美国陷在中东，当它们不断身陷困境时，中国的战略性收益就会不断叠加，有些已经拿到手，还有些正在路上。",

        "summary": "In recent days, China has been visiting Kazakhstan, which the author views as a significant opportunity for China's land power expansion. Historically, China's power extension has faced two major obstacles: U.S. naval dominance in the east and Russian territorial control in the west. The latter has particularly hindered China's westward land power development, exemplified by the delayed China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway project, which only recently made progress after 27 years.\n\nThe geopolitical landscape has shifted, providing China with a rare opportunity. The U.S. has been retracting its military presence from the Middle East and Afghanistan, creating a power vacuum. The Russia-Ukraine war has weakened Russia's grip on Central Asia, prompting Central Asian countries to seek alternative alliances to balance Russian influence. Additionally, India's influence in Afghanistan has waned, further easing China's westward expansion.\n\nThese changes have facilitated the advancement of the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway and deepened China's cooperation with Central Asia and the Middle East. China's current visit to Kazakhstan is expected to yield significant outcomes, such as opening more border crossings.\n\nThe author warns of potential risks, including Russia's strategic maneuvers and its recent alliance with North Korea, which could destabilize the Korean Peninsula and involve the U.S. and NATO. The author emphasizes the importance of China maintaining strategic composure to capitalize on these geopolitical shifts while avoiding entanglement in regional conflicts."

        "body": "俄乌战争爆发以前，在世界上一发155毫米炮弹1500美元，俄乌战争爆发以后，美国和欧盟在全世界为乌克兰订购155毫米炮弹，价格也从2000美元、3000美元、4000美元一路上涨到8000美元一发。\n\n很多国家看到了发财的机会，特别是那些经济困难的中小国家都看到了可以大赚一笔的机会。巴基斯坦现在负债上千亿美元，不仅每年都要偿还贷款和利息。而且，还要花费大量外汇进口钢材、能源、粮食和工业产品。\n\n巴基斯坦本身没有石油天然气出口赚钱，也没有大量工业产品可以发财。俄乌战争价格暴涨8倍的155毫米炮弹就让巴基斯坦看到了赚钱的机会。\n\n美国《新闻周刊》报道，巴基斯坦正在将炮弹出售给乌克兰。而美国主导的国际货币基金组织则向巴基斯坦提供援助。其实就是换一个思路，美国付给巴基斯坦炮弹钱。\n\n巴基斯坦从哪里得到这么多155毫米炮弹？巴基斯坦在2020年以5.12亿美元，从我国进口了432门S-15型155毫米口径卡车炮，装备了24个炮兵营。\n\n这批我国产155毫米卡车炮就配套有大量155毫米炮弹，全是北约标准，可以在北约制造155毫米榴弹炮发射。可以说是量大还便宜，转手就能拿到几倍价格。\n\n巴基斯坦这个中立就是两边都要占到好处。巴基斯坦有这么多炮弹可以高价出售。俄罗斯必须要拉拢巴基斯坦。为此俄罗斯也与巴基斯坦签署了一项原油协议，可以向巴基斯坦提供便宜原油。\n\n芬兰-乌克兰防务协会最近也表示，我国生产的155毫米炮弹便宜，数量大。该组织也想通过第三方渠道引进该炮弹，再转售给乌克兰。\n\n其实，俄乌前线，乌军无人机多的一群一顿的，天天发动蜂群攻击。乌克兰哪里来的这么多无人机？\n\n我国宣布禁止向俄乌战区出口无人机以后。乌克兰没办法进口无人机了，但是欧盟和其他亲西方国家却在大量进口我国无人机，再转手送给乌克兰。\n\n这个路数，就与俄罗斯为躲过西方制裁。就通过第三方国家与公司大量引进被禁止的机床，军民两用产品和电子零配件的办法一样。\n\n俄罗斯军工有多大产能？\n\n英国皇家联合军种研究所报告称，在2024年俄罗斯国防工业将可以生产100万发152毫米炮弹，在2022年俄罗斯152毫米炮弹产量只有25万发。\n\n在2024年，俄罗斯122毫米火箭弹产量将达到50万发。大口径火箭弹产量达到1.7万发。每年生产420枚KH-101型巡航导弹，伊斯坎尔德弹道导弹产量也要增加2倍。\n\n俄罗斯Shahed-136 无人机每月产量250架。坦克装甲车则要把产量提高到1年1500辆坦克和3000辆各种装甲车辆。其中85%为库存坦克装甲车翻新升级。\n\n最新型的BMP-3步兵战车产能将达到1个季度135辆。俄罗斯国防部评估，西方制裁已导致俄罗斯军事装备和武器使用的关键微电子元件价格上涨 30%。\n\n俄罗斯新动员的部队，一个志愿者将可以得到2230美元联邦签约奖金，然后还可以得到5730美元州地区奖金，3500美元州长奖金。就是说志愿兵只要签约，就可以先拿到1.1万美元奖金，其他工资补贴再单独计算。\n\n英国皇家联合军种研究所报告称，俄罗斯正在不断加强对乌军压力，摧毁乌克兰基础设施，延长战争时间，加大乌克兰付出的代价。\n\n俄罗斯这样的目的是加速乌克兰资源衰竭，继续延长冲突的时间、空间和资源，目的是耗尽乌克兰军队和基辅政府持续抵抗俄罗斯军事打击的能力。最终迫使基辅政府签署符合俄罗斯利益的停战协议。",

        "summary": "The news article discusses the escalating conflict between Russia and Ukraine, highlighting the increasing intensity of Ukrainian military firepower. It reveals that Pakistan has been selling 155mm artillery shells to Ukraine, which were originally imported from China. The price of these shells has surged from $1,500 to $8,000 each due to the war. The U.S. and the EU have been purchasing these shells for Ukraine, and the IMF, led by the U.S., is providing financial aid to Pakistan, effectively paying for the artillery indirectly.\n\nPakistan, facing significant debt and economic challenges, sees this as a lucrative opportunity. Russia, in response, has signed an oil agreement with Pakistan to secure its support. Additionally, the article mentions that Ukraine is receiving drones from EU countries, which are importing them from China despite a ban on direct exports to the conflict zone.\n\nThe article also details Russia's plans to ramp up its military production significantly by 2024, including artillery shells, rockets, drones, and armored vehicles. The British Royal United Services Institute reports that Russia aims to prolong the conflict to deplete Ukraine's resources and force a favorable ceasefire agreement."

        "body": "\"我们将不得不在未来几年内对NGAD做出选择\"，美国空军参谋长戴维·阿尔文在美国空军和太空军协会（AFA）的一次活动中对NGAD表态。美国空军部长弗兰克·肯德尔最近也告诉《航空周刊》，预算限制迫使美国空军重新审视其NGAD计划。\n\n按照美空军计划，在2024年将发布下一代空中优势飞机的工程和制造开发合同。该计划于去年宣布后，洛克希德·马丁公司和波音公司即开始了竞争。NGAD是美军的第一架第六代战斗机。美国海军也有一个类似的同名项目，致力于建造第六代战斗机，称为F/A-XX。\n\n当时，肯德尔在一份声明中说，\"NGAD平台是空中优势系统系列的重要组成部分，它代表了F-22技术的代际飞跃，它将取代F-22\"。他强调，\"NGAD将包括增强的杀伤力和在空中生存、持久、互操作和适应的能力等属性，所有这些都是在竞争激烈的作战环境中进行的。没有人比美国空军做得更好，但如果我们现在不向前迈进，我们将失去这种优势。\"\n\n如今，\"空军的下一代空中优势战斗机在2026财年预算中面临不确定的未来。\"阿尔文表示，美国空军不打算让单架协同作战飞机服役很长时间，而是倾向于迅速转向自主无人机的未来迭代。阿尔文解释道：\"需要明确的是，审议仍在进行中。尚未做出任何决定。我们正在考虑许多我们必须考虑的非常困难的选择。\"\n\n美空军领导层是否在考虑对冲NGAD计划，目前尚不明朗。但对仍处在竞争中的洛克希德·马丁公司和波音公司来说将面临困境，因为NGAD计划曾是美空军的首要任务，所以两家公司为了赢得合同都已进行了大量投入，如果该计划被取消，无疑将对竞争者造成巨大打击。\n\n在行业方面必然也将影响到供应商，因为那些供应商也一直在为下一代空中优势系统做准备，却在突然之间迎来一个\"不确定的未来\"，这让他们不得不去面对和承受。\n\n美国空军对下一代空中优势NGAD计划的这些微妙变化，不仅给军界、商家及行业带来诸多困惑，而且对美空军的下一代战斗机等装备发展也将产生重要影响。\n\n那么，美国空军曾经的首选项目NGAD为何会出现如此逆转？\n\n首先，预算限制迫使美国空军重新审视其NGAD计划。预算限制促使美空军对NGAD犹豫不决，因为研发和购买下一代战斗机的费用太高了，购买这种战斗机单价的费用就预计约为3亿美元，何况美空军计划在未来几年内在F-35、新型B-21\"突袭者\"轰炸机、下一代\"哨兵\"洲际弹道导弹等项目上花费越来越多的资金。目前，美空军正在制定2026财年的预算，该预算将比2025年更加紧张，部分原因是像\"哨兵\"洲际弹道导弹更新这样的大型项目的成本远远超过最初预期。美空军要一并考虑为\"哨兵\"洲际导弹飙升的成本提供资金、进一步开发B-21、采购F-35等，同时应对国会预算上限、通货膨胀和其他资源拖累。实际上，美空军的预算正在寻求平衡\"今天的风险与明天的风险，现代化与今天的准备状态\"。\n\n其次，新技术发展使得美空军重新思考空中优势的未来。俄乌战争中的无人机和其他新技术正在改变战争的性质，美空军领导层认为，不能追求将所有\"鸡蛋放在一个篮子里\"，因为如果威胁加剧，他们将无法转向。所以，美空军可能将重新考虑其制造非常昂贵且高度复杂的飞机的计划。如果NGAD被取消，五角大楼可能会让洛克希德·马丁公司的F-35飞机服役更长时间，从而为国防巨头带来更多资金。考虑到美空军需要支付的所有项目，以及发展其新的协作战斗机项目的愿望，NGAD可能是美空军唯一可以削减的项目。\n\n观念的改变也是美空军\"逆转\"NGAD计划的动因。虽然现在判断NGAD是否会被取消还为时过早，但美空军领导人最近的言论却表明\"非常突然的逆转\"。以往新一代飞机的设计理念强调\"经久耐用\"的固有观念。如今这一切正在改变，如无人机与有人驾驶战斗机协同执行任务，这些无人战斗机不会维持25年或30年，因为它们便宜且快速迭代。值得注意的是，美国空军还可能重新考虑其整体作战概念，如依赖B-21、无人驾驶战斗机和对峙武器，而不再是传统飞机。\n\n因此，无论是受预算的限制，还是对新技术冲击的担忧，以及对有人战斗机设计未来的不确定性，目前都还有许多悬而未决的问题。正像美国航空航天咨询公司董事总经理理查德·阿布拉菲亚所说，美国空军可能在NGAD上摇摆不定，因为它正在处理一个\"真正悲惨的选择\"。",

        "summary": "The U.S. Air Force's Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program is facing significant uncertainty due to budget constraints and evolving technological considerations. Key points include:\n\n1. **Budget Constraints**: U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff David Alvin and Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall have indicated that financial limitations are forcing a reassessment of the NGAD program. The high costs of developing and purchasing the next-generation fighter, estimated at around $300 million per unit, are a major concern.\n\n2. **Technological Shifts**: The emergence of new technologies, such as drones, influenced by conflicts like the Russia-Ukraine war, is prompting the Air Force to reconsider its strategy. There is a growing preference for autonomous drones over expensive, complex manned aircraft.\n\n3. **Program Uncertainty**: The NGAD program, initially a top priority, now faces an uncertain future in the 2026 fiscal year budget. This uncertainty affects major defense contractors like Lockheed Martin and Boeing, who have heavily invested in the competition for the NGAD contract.\n\n4. **Strategic Re-evaluation**: The Air Force is contemplating a shift towards a mix of B-21 bombers, unmanned combat aircraft, and standoff weapons, potentially reducing reliance on traditional manned fighters.\n\n5. **Implications**: The potential cancellation or scaling back of the NGAD program could have significant impacts on the defense industry and the future of U.S. air combat capabilities.\n\nIn summary, the NGAD program's future is in flux due to financial pressures and a strategic pivot towards new technologies, leading to broader implications for the U.S. Air Force and defense contractors."

        "title": "白宫：拜登没有老年痴呆症_中华网",
        "body": "一场电视辩论，极有可能改变世界。\n\n拜登的衰老让大家惊掉下巴，反观特朗普，表现虽然难说完美，但依然超过拜登。在随后的观众问卷调查中，有近7成的人认可特朗普表现更好。白宫：拜登没有老年痴呆症！\n\n还有一个细节很有意思，辩论结束后，特朗普健步如飞走回后台，而拜登却要在妻子的搀扶下，亦步亦趋地走下台阶。\n\n惨淡的表现，让一些媒体人开始为拜登退选造势。白宫：拜登没有老年痴呆症！\n\n不过，如果你还停留在\"两个80岁的老头还在为一份工作挣得脸红耳赤，我们还有什么理由躺平？\"的吃瓜阶段，丝毫感受不到扑面而来的大变化，那你就很可能成为未来吃瓜群众吃瓜的材料。\n\n百年未有之大变局，变的和被变的，都有很多。\n\n客观地说，拜登这四年，工作做得还是可以的。\n\n对内熬过了新冠疫情，对外重新团结了盟友。\n\n虽然引发了大通胀，国外也出现了俄乌、巴以冲突，但还是硬生生让美国经济扛过了最猛烈的加息周期，以及地缘冲突的负面影响，还意外地吃到了AI产业的红利。\n\n现在回过头看，不管以何种角度，美国都算是过去4年，混乱的国际政经局势下最大的赢家。\n\n只不过，天下没有不散之宴席。工作做得再好，年纪始终是一个无法逾越的障碍。\n\n拜登今年已经82岁，用中国人的话说，是耄耋之年。\n\n马化腾说过一句话：有时候你什么都没做错，错就错在你太老了。\n\n这句话其实也很适合拜登。\n\n不管怎么样，拜登这一次大选，输的概率还是不小的。\n\n美国的博彩网站，就已经就大选结果进行押注。\n\n如果觉得博彩网站不靠谱，那就说说民调吧。\n\n据民意调查和市场预测聚合平台InteractivePolls，辩论前，特朗普的支持率为59%，拜登为34%，而在辩论后，特朗普的支持率升至65%，拜登的支持率则下滑至23%。\n\n所以，媒体大谈拜登退选，绝不能简单地说是捕风捉影，这个时候拜登如果退选，大家也不要觉得有什么奇怪，大概就是顺坡下驴而已。\n\n虽然拜登的家人、白宫都声称支持拜登继续角逐总统，但美国选民也会掂量，难道我们真的要把希望寄托在一个开始老年痴呆的老人身上吗？万一拜登在任上出现什么不测，国家又该如何是好，尽管按照美国的制度，副总统完全可以履行总统职务，但明知道有这个风险，为什么要冒？\n\n如果拜登退选，民主党现在也没有谁能够真的担当他的替补，最大呼声的加州州长纽森，还略显稚嫩，至于再后面的，两名女将，就更扯了。\n\n反观特朗普，胜率正在攀升。现在，很多机构都在为特朗普重新上台做准备，金融圈算是其中一个最积极的地方。大摩刚刚发表了最新研报，对特朗普重新上台导致的经济和金融状况展开分析。\n\n如果说之前还摇摆不定，看不清方向，那么现在，是时候为特朗普重回白宫做准备了。\n\n变，亦或不变？\n\n要做准备，就需要明白特朗普回来之后导致的变与不变。\n\n先说不变的。\n\n针对东方肯定是不会变的，考虑到特朗普是做生意出身，贸易和科技打压应该是重中之重，这点其实和拜登没有区别，也足以证明美国两党在这个问题上的一致性。\n\n所以，不要抱有侥幸，一点都不要有。出口这边的压力还是不小的，以美国的号召力，其他主要市场基本都会靠边站。最近欧洲跟随美国脚步对咱电动车加征关税，连印尼也在加征关税，就是最好的例子。\n\n在高科技领域上，特别是现在最火的AI，芯片和软件系统，基本也不会给咱用。这些方面我们都是要继续做好准备。\n\n其次，是美国优先的原则，大量的美国公司可能会将产业搬回美国，不要说新兴国家，就算是一个老牌盟友的产业，都有可能会被特朗普拉回去。\n\n最后，变的可能美国的海外政策。\n\n最具威胁的，是特朗普会不会信守自己的承诺，以最快的速度结束俄乌战争。他在公开场合不止一次表达过，自己如果当上总统，一天就可以结束战争。\n\n别以为他信口雌黄，实际上他是可以做得到的，因为如今俄罗斯也深陷战争泥潭，战略空间越来越小，而且被全球绝大部分的主流国家隔绝，他们也在寻求出路。\n\n做生意是交换，玩政治更是交换，只是政治上的利益交换要大得多。\n\n深谙此道的特朗普，如果拿得出足够的筹码和普京交换，比如选择让出乌克兰被占领的4个州，以换取俄罗斯收兵并承诺不再进攻欧洲，你说这是不是俄罗斯想要的？又是不是比简单地输送华强北的无人机零配件要好得多？\n\n其实，以现在俄罗斯的实力，继续耗下去，绝非上策，他也不可能对抗得了整个北约。现在缺的，就是一个利益交换的筹码和契机。\n\n我们不知道特朗普会拿出什么筹码和普京交换，但谁都知道，美国手里的筹码，才是真正让俄罗斯流口水的筹码。\n\n而俄罗斯，其实也有美国想要的筹码。\n\n至于什么筹码，回看一下60多年前的那段历史，大概就明白了。\n\n如果特朗普回来，经济如何？股市又会如何？\n\n因为是商人出身，特朗普搞经济确实有一手，这个不得不服，他第一任期的时候就如此。\n\n在任期间，美国GDP的增速每年都超过2%，股市表现也挺好，2020年新冠疫情除外。\n\n也正是他果断地无底线放水，给居民发钱，使得美国安然度过新冠疫情，即使引发了后来的通胀，但最后也没有让美国经济崩溃。\n\n说起特朗普的政策，其实并没有太多新鲜事，就是减税、放水，外加产业回迁。一连串组合拳下来，企业有钱有生意，美国人有工作，这些事其实拜登也在做，只不过特朗普可能会更加极端一点。\n\n这对于美国经济，是好事，对美股也是好事。唯一不好的，可能是通胀，以及因为通胀多引发的货币政策变化，以及潜在的经济风险。\n\n大摩刚刚表示，特朗普赢得美国总统大选的可能性上升，在这种情形下，美国经济增长可能会放缓，通胀则可能加速，这使得押注美债收益率曲线变陡正变得有吸引力。\n\n投资者需要做好风险对冲。\n\n至于我们这边，货币政策大概率会跟随美联储，那边降我们才敢继续维持宽松。\n\n降了之后，就看流动性对于经济影响如何，但老美降息不可能一步到位，我们经济回暖同样也是，所以对于国内市场来说，短期内流动性大概率还是空转，那股市大概率就跟现在区别不大。\n\n其实拜登退或不退，大概率都不会影响美国的走向，但可能会加速世界局势的变化。\n\n最近几年，大家都能够感受到一个明显的变化：世界正在重新走向两个极端，而且这种两极化，和几十年前很类似。\n\n就说一个很简单的，经济模式，有的国家加强了政府管制，从自由回归到政府控制。而有的国家则强推自由化。\n\n最大的例子，要数阿根廷，在一个疯狂经济学家米莱的试验下，各种骚操作，大有不把阿根廷折腾到底不罢休的意思。\n\n为什么会这样？\n\n因为这可能是解决眼前困难最快的方法。\n\n为什么如今西方世界集体向右看？\n\n那是因为历史上这样的成功例子很多，典型的要数1980年代，由里根和撒切尔夫人推行的自由化改革。他们都深受新自由主义经济思想的影响，他们认为减少政府对经济的干预，通过减税、去管制等措施能够激发市场活力，促进自由竞争，从而实现经济的繁荣。\n\n更重要的一点，撒切尔夫人和里根都坚定地反对苏联，他们的新自由主义政策也是对苏联的一种意识形态上的对抗，他们试图通过自由化改革来证明西方制度的优越性。\n\n很多年之后，他们或许才发现，自己号称的所谓自由世界，结果活成了当年苏联的样子：尽养了一堆权贵和闲人。大公司越来越垄断，有权的人越来越横，有钱的人越来越富。\n\n所以，他们要重新拥抱自由，拥抱竞争，说白了，就是谁行谁上，不行的，下来。\n\n他们的路到底对不对，等时间去证明吧。\n\n但是，如果不走那样的路子，不用证明也知道，结果一定不会好到哪里去。白宫：拜登没有老年痴呆症！",

        "summary": "The article discusses the recent television debate between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, highlighting Biden's perceived frailty and Trump's stronger performance. A significant portion of the audience (around 70%) believed Trump performed better. The White House has denied claims that Biden has dementia, despite his age-related challenges. Biden, now 82, faces criticism and speculation about his potential withdrawal from the presidential race, with polls showing a decline in his support compared to Trump.\n\nThe article also explores the broader implications of a potential Trump return to the presidency, including his likely continuation of tough trade and technology policies against China, and his promise to quickly end the Russia-Ukraine war. Trump's economic policies, characterized by tax cuts and deregulation, are expected to benefit the U.S. economy and stock market, though they may also lead to increased inflation.\n\nThe geopolitical landscape is shifting, with the world moving towards two extremes, reminiscent of the Cold War era. The article concludes by noting that regardless of whether Biden withdraws, significant changes in global dynamics are inevitable."

        "summary": "Finnish President Alexander Stubb stated that China's influence over Russia has reached a point where a single phone call from Chinese President Xi Jinping could end the Russia-Ukraine war. In an interview in Helsinki on July 2, Stubb emphasized Russia's heavy reliance on China and suggested that if Xi were to advocate for peace negotiations, Russia would have no choice but to comply.\n\nStubb's comments highlight the growing frustration among Ukraine's allies regarding China's perceived support for Russia, including providing military technology and helping Russia circumvent international trade restrictions. Despite China's official stance of neutrality in the conflict, it has criticized Russia's attacks on civilians and threats of nuclear weapon use, while opposing international sanctions not backed by the United Nations.\n\nTrade data shows China's share of Russia's total trade increased to 28% in 2022 from 19% in 2021, while the EU's share dropped from 36% to 17% in the same period. Stubb argued that ending the war would benefit China by upholding international rules related to territorial integrity and sovereignty, showcasing China's leadership.\n\nXi Jinping and Vladimir Putin are expected to meet on July 3 during the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Kazakhstan, following their discussions in Beijing in May where Xi reiterated China's support for a political resolution to the Ukraine conflict."

During the first debate of the election on June 27, 2023, Trump reiterated this claim, stating he could solve the conflict before his inauguration. However, Russian officials, including the Russian Ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, and Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, have dismissed Trump's assertions as unrealistic and lacking substantive details. Nebenzia emphasized that the war, ongoing since February 2022, cannot be resolved in a day and criticized Western support for prolonging the conflict. Peskov added that any peace plan proposed by a future Trump administration must reflect the current realities on the ground in Ukraine.

These drones have not yet been deployed in Ukraine.\n\nSince the Russia-Ukraine war began, Russia has used thousands of Iranian \"Shahed\" drones and even built a factory to mass-produce them.

The U.S. believes China is considering sending fully assembled drones to Russia but is currently shipping parts that can be converted into attack drones. China has also been supplying satellite imagery, microelectronics, and other materials that can be used for military purposes.\n\nChina's embassy in the U.S. denies providing weapons to any party in the Ukraine conflict and emphasizes its control over dual-use exports.

He toured unmanned production lines and a unified production management system, urging the sharing of these innovations with other economic fields.

This vote, which lacks legal validity, was aimed at determining whether five Russian regions should secede from Russia. The FNRF has been labeled an \"undesirable organization\" by the Russian Prosecutor General's Office due to perceived threats to Russia's constitutional order and security. The results of this vote, which were released unilaterally by the organizing committee without any verification, indicated significant support for independence in these regions. However, the authenticity of these results is questionable, and the voting website has been restricted by Russian authorities. The FNRF's activities and the online vote have not received substantial coverage in Russian media and are not officially recognized."

        "title": "传播观察｜\"疑美\"热点解析：美国对台军售\"又烂又贵\"？",
        "body": "美国政府6月中宣布对台销售两款攻击型无人机飞弹系统，总额约3.6亿美元。这起军售案再度掀起\"疑美论\"，部分台湾评论人士在电视、网路节目指控美国售台的无人机\"毫无用处\"\"贵得离谱\"，言论经两岸媒体转载后，话题延烧至今热度不减。\n\n亚洲事实查核实验室（AFCL）通过向美国国务院查证，采访军事专家，和比对官方公开资料与相关报道，发现前述评论人在欠缺证据的情况下，传播了误导信息。\n\n台\"名嘴\"批军售案 两岸媒体传播发酵\n\n美东时间6月18日，美国国防安全合作局（DSCA）发布两则新闻稿，公告行政部门已通知国会，将对台湾出售720架\"人员杀伤型（弹簧刀300）\"等军备和服务，这笔军售约6020万美元；另批准至多291套\"反装甲型（ALTIUS 600M）\"无人机系统，这笔军售约3亿美元。\n\n美国宣布对台军售后不久，台湾前立委郭正亮便在个人网路节目《亮话天下》说，\"有人去查，美国这次倒货给台湾，价格是市价的五倍⋯⋯美国为什么倒货给台湾，为什么没有人要买，因为这款无人机炸弹系统在俄乌战争被俄罗斯破解了⋯⋯\"。\n\n《亮话天下》在YouTube\"郭正亮频道\"、哏传媒、中天新闻等平台播放，而郭正亮质疑\"弹簧刀300\"用处和价格的内容，获风传媒等媒体引述报道，并经Yahoo!新闻转载。郭正亮也在《国际直球对决》等其他节目上发表类似论述，称这笔军售\"贵得离谱\"，这些言论也被中时新闻网、Nownews等多家媒体引述。\n\n除了郭正亮，据中时新闻网报道，另一位\"名嘴\"帅化民在中天节目上，直批弹簧刀300型无人机\"是垃圾\"；另据中天新闻网报道，退将栗正杰在中天节目上说，美国军售台湾弹簧刀无人机，是把台湾\"当盘子\"（盘子：台方言，指好骗，容易被占便宜）。\n\n上述台湾评论人士的言论，不仅透过台湾各大媒体引述报道，也传到中国媒体，包括凤凰网、腾讯网转载了《海峡导报》的相关报道，也出现在台海网的微博视频号，并经多位微博、网易用户分享，在两岸舆论场上热议多日。\n\n军事专家怎么说？\n\n前述评论人的批评大致分为三点：武器太贵、没用、没人要。多数评论人士仅提出其个人见解，并未说明他们引用的数据或资料来源。亚洲事实查核实验室透过检视公开报道与资料、采访专家、向官方查证等方式，对上述言论的准确性进行验证。\n\n评论声称没有其他国家要买\"弹簧刀300\"，但根据制造商空境公司（AeroVironment）发布的新闻稿，以及军闻网站Army Recognition报道，法国与另一个美国盟国在2023年采购了这款攻击型无人机系统，计划今年7月交付。至于\"弹簧刀300\"在战场上的表现，包括《金融时报》《国家利益》杂志等媒体都有所报道，指它体积小、技术含量相对较低，适合乌克兰抵抗运动，但随著俄罗斯改进其电子战系统，发送假信息干扰无人机导航，乌克兰逐渐减少使用无人机。\n\n美国智库\"国际评估与战略中心\"资深研究员费学礼（Richard Fisher）告诉亚洲事实查核实验室，台湾迫切需要数千架此类无人机系统，以抵挡解放军的空降和两栖入侵部队，而且用各种无人机系统对抗解放军，使对方的防御需求复杂化，对台湾而言也是个好策略。费学礼并说，当然台湾也可以像乌克兰一样，把数千架中国制造的便宜业余无人机变成武器，但这些无人机的软体有可能会被解放军控制。\n\n曾任职于美国国防部、美国在台协会（AIT）、雷神公司的胡振东（Tony Hu）则认为，乌克兰和台湾的使用情况不同，\"弹簧刀300\"相对适合台湾的环境，因为会用于海上，敌人没有什么建筑物可躲藏，不像在乌克兰。\n\n台湾国防部6月24日发布新闻稿说明，部分人士评论\"陆军采购攻击无人机不符作战需求\"陈述内容欠缺考证，并不属实。国防部并表示，各型无人机为现在战场不对称战力的重要运用方式，台湾采购的两款无人机系统，具侦打一体功能，操作简单，为美军现役装备。\n\n评论称\"贵得离谱\"有根据吗？\n\n部分评论人士和网红尤其关注\"弹簧刀300\"的价格，包括郭正亮称\"有人去查，美国这次倒货给台湾，价格是市价的五倍价格\"；在微博拥有390多万粉丝的\"小凡好摄\"称根据NBC报道称，\"弹簧刀300\"的建造成本仅6000美元。\n\n亚洲事实查核实验室发现，有关\"弹簧刀300\"的成本，网上出现好几种金额。例如，\"小凡好摄\"所引用的NBC报道中，确实提及\"据估计，弹簧刀300的价格可能仅为6000美元。\"但根据美国军方公开的2023财年预算文件，\"弹簧刀300\"的单位成本为52914美元。\n\n然而，胡振东告诉亚洲事实查核实验室，\"一个武器多少钱\"这种比较没有意义，\"因为台湾不是买一个飞弹，而是买capability（作战能力），所以会有训练、（零）部件等很多东西加进去。\"胡振东说明，目前在通知国会的程序，公告价格只是估计，这个阶段会把所有可能发生的事情加入，价格会比较高，双方谈合约时才是真的价钱。\n\n过去面对外界质疑F-16V采购价时，台湾空军司令部曾提出单机价格资料，显示台湾采购单价比起巴林、斯洛伐克、摩洛哥、保加利亚等采购国，并没有更贵。但空军司令部也特别说明，F-16V（BLK70/72）采购国，各国采购品项不尽相同，价格资讯为参考使用。根据DSCA的公告，台湾、巴林、斯洛伐克、摩洛哥、保加利亚虽然都向美国采购F-16V战机，但购买的品项、数量、供货期程并不相同，因此以采购单价推估是否买贵，意义不大。\n\n美国国务院官员回复亚洲事实查核实验室表示，美国政府与包括台湾在内的外国合作伙伴密切合作，依据他们的特定需求进行对外军售。基于这些系统对台湾而言是新引进的，这笔军售案不仅涉及军备系统本身的需求，还涉及台湾成功引进与维持该系统所需的相关部件和服务。\n\n胡振东表示，部分评论人士并没有实际参与军售的经验，在\"乱讲\"。他认为这是\"疑美论\"，是中国认知战的一部分，希望大部分台湾人民能够睁大眼睛，认清错假信息。\n\n军售案遭疑\"贵五倍\"不是第一次\n\n近几年美国公告对台军售后，两岸舆论场上反复出现\"疑美论\"，质疑美国售台的武器\"又烂又贵\"。其中一例是台湾的节目主持人，时为国民党副总统候选人的赵少康，曾在去年底举办的政见会上，质疑台湾采购MQ-9B无人机买贵五倍，台湾国防部随后发布新闻稿澄清。且在台湾副总统政见会之前，台湾事实查核中心也已经针对网传\"买贵五倍\"的说法发布过查核报告。\n\n另一例是亚洲事实查核实验室今年初发布的 《台湾花大价钱从美国买F-16\"落伍战机\"，是\"冤大头\"？》，查核结果为\"错误\"。美国之音（VOA）\"揭谎频道\"、台湾事实查核中心等单位，也都曾针对不同军售案的传言进行查核。\n\n根据台湾资讯环境研究中心（IORG）报告，2021年8月拜登政府首次对台军售，便出现指控所购军备是\"废铁\"\"天价\"、军售是\"骗钱\"的论述。然而这些年来，相似剧本不断上演，这次无人机军售案也不例外。\n\n此外，对于这件无人机军售案，台湾国防部、外交部等单位表示欢迎与感谢，中国外交部则一贯反对，指控美国对台出售武器，严重违反一个中国原则和中美三个联合公报，特别是\"八一七公报\"规定。有关美国对台军售是否违反\"八一七公报\"，亚洲事实查核实验室也曾发布详细报告。\n\n亚洲事实查核实验室（Asia Fact Check Lab）针对当今复杂媒体环境以及新兴传播生态而成立。我们本于新闻专业主义，提供专业查核报告及与信息环境相关的传播观察、深度报道，帮助读者对公共议题获得多元而全面的认识。读者若对任何媒体及社交软件传播的信息有疑问，欢迎以电邮afcl@rfa.org寄给亚洲事实查核实验室，由我们为您查证核实。\n\n亚洲事实查核实验室在X、脸书、IG开张了，欢迎读者追踪、分享、转发。X这边请进：中文@asiafactcheckcn；英文：@AFCL_eng、FB在这里、IG也别忘了。",

        "summary": "In June, the U.S. government announced a $360 million arms sale to Taiwan, including two attack drone missile systems. This sparked controversy in Taiwan, with some commentators claiming the drones were overpriced and ineffective. These claims were widely circulated by media in both Taiwan and China.\n\nThe Asia Fact Check Lab (AFCL) investigated these claims by consulting U.S. State Department sources, military experts, and public records. They found that the criticisms lacked evidence and were misleading. For instance, contrary to claims that no other countries wanted the \"Switchblade 300\" drones, France and another U.S. ally had purchased them in 2023.\n\nExperts like Richard Fisher and Tony Hu argued that these drones are suitable for Taiwan's defense needs, especially against potential Chinese military actions. The Taiwan Ministry of National Defense also defended the purchase, stating the drones are crucial for asymmetric warfare.\n\nThe AFCL noted that similar \"overpriced\" accusations have been made about other U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, often as part of broader skepticism towards U.S. intentions. The U.S. State Department emphasized that arms sales are tailored to the specific needs of partners like Taiwan.\n\nThe controversy highlights ongoing debates about the value and purpose of U.S. military support to Taiwan amid rising tensions with China."

"旅居加拿大的前军官江林（看中国张小非摄）\n\n【看中国2024年7月3日讯】（看中国记者肖然采访报导）中共两任国防部长李尚福和魏凤和涉及腐败被开除出党，两起案件已移交军事检察官指控。前《解放军报》记者江林近日接受《看中国》采访时表示，中国军队如今已经腐败透顶，毫无战斗力。对于习近平是否会武力统一台湾，她也做出了预测。\n\n自去年夏天以来，中国国防机构进行了大规模清洗，上述两人是迄今为止被罢免的最大官员，此次清洗已导致十多名高级将领和军工企业高管下台。\n\n在中国国家主席习近平寻求增强中国武装力量、提高其战斗力和更积极地维护中国在该地区有争议的领土主张之际，中国人民解放军高层出现了动荡。\n\n在职业生涯的巅峰时期，前国防部长李尚福和魏凤和经常在世界顶级军事官员面前表现出强硬的语气。在连续举行的地区安全论坛上，这两位将军警告说，如果有人胆敢将自治的台湾从中国\"分裂\"出去，中国军队将\"不惜一切代价\"予以打击。他们还暗中向美国发出攻击，誓言要反击有争议的南海的\"霸权\"。\n\nCNN引述分析人士认为，这两位国防部长都是习近平提拔的，尽管中国领导人已经进行了十多年的反腐运动，但他们还是被免职，这凸显了军队最高层防止腐败的难度。\n\n新加坡拉惹勒南国际研究院研究员詹姆斯．查尔表示，尽管习近平的反腐运动取得了一些成功，但由于缺乏适当的民间监督和独立的司法体系，解放军只能依赖内部调查人员进行监督。他说，\"这很困难，所以腐败肯定会继续存在。\"\n\n为了实现习近平将解放军打造成\"世界一流\"战斗力量的宏伟目标，中国已投入数十亿美元购买和升级装备。习近平还组建了火箭军，这是一支精锐部队，负责管理中国快速扩张的核武库和弹道导弹库。\n\n去年被无故解职或失踪的将军大多与火箭军或军事装备有关，其中包括李尚福和魏凤和。\n\n在担任国防部长之前，李尚福担任解放军装备发展部部长五年。66岁的李尚福是一名工程师，在中国西南地区从事火箭和卫星发射工作数十年，后来被提拔到解放军总部负责军事装备采购。\n\n魏凤和今年70岁，是火箭军的首任司令员。2015年底，习近平将火箭军从解放军的前导弹部队第二炮兵提升为正式部队，魏凤和曾在第二炮兵部队工作数十年。魏凤和在火箭军的两位继任者也遭到清洗。\n\n中共中央政治局24名成员发布的声明中对李尚福的指控明确指出了武器采购中的腐败行为。\n\n据中央电视台消息称，除了收受贿赂和滥用职权外，李尚福还被指控\"严重污染军事装备行业的政治环境和行业行为\"。\n\n五角大楼资助的国防大学高级研究员乔尔．伍斯诺表示，这句措辞谨慎的措辞指出，制造武器的国有企业与解放军采购系统之间存在勾结。伍斯诺说：\"我们知道存在一些勾结，但不清楚关键武器是否真的不合格或不可靠，而且中共也不会承认这一点。\"\"如果事实属实，这对习近平来说将更加严重，因为他不仅会对遵纪守法产生怀疑，还会对实际的军事准备产生怀疑。\"\n\n记者：自去年夏天以来，习近平对国防机构进行大清洗，李尚福和魏凤和是迄今被罢免的最大官员，两人也与火箭军或军事装备有关。这次清洗已导致十多名高级将领和军工企业高管下台。作为前军官，你对此有什么看法？\n\n江林：他们都有共同性,包括对他们的审判的公布的那些罪行的言语,几乎都是一样的。\n\n他们所处的这个环境是一样的，他们都来自于军队，军队都是那样的传统、那样的制度，所以他们犯错误的原因都几乎一样。我觉得军队的高级干部和地方的那些高官的罪行也差不多。\n\n每个人都贪污受贿，不同的是数额不一样，现在几乎数额也都在一级了，越来越大。不是说通过习近平反腐，这个数额越来越少了，现在完全没有起到阻吓效果。比如某某贪污了几千万算什么呀，跟那个亿级比起来根本不算什么。贪污的数额越来越高，但共性都是一样，说明他们所处的土壤、这个制度根本没有改变。不仅没有改变，也没有任何改善。\n\n我觉得有意思的方面，说起他们的罪行都说他们背叛初心的什么的。判决出来以后，老百姓下面的跟帖都在说，他们官都当了这么大了还要贪污，这些人到底想做多大的官呀？还不能满足吗？我觉得这些人的疑问是有道理的，实际上你如果仔细的看他们的履历，了解他们产生罪恶的土壤，你就会发现不是从现在开始的，冰冻三尺非一日之寒。\n\n他们怎么去背叛初心呢？他们初心在什么时候开始改变的呢？\n\n我觉得绝对不是他们坐上国防部长的这个高位的时候，一般的人坐上这个高位，他们都认为已经是不错的了，梦寐以求终于走到这高位了，谁还会在这个高位上去触犯底线？就是从这个位置开始这种罪恶是比较少见的。尤其从军人来讲，都不是起自于这个高位，而是说他们过去就是就是这样的。\n\n我觉得他们初心的背叛，其实际上是来源于64，因为64的前后，我都在军队军报，我接触的这个面也很广，尤其我那个时候是做机动记者，所谓机动记者，就是负责采访这些高级干部和中央军委。中央军委有些什么活动，还有这些人的个人专访什么的，都是我们这几个记者在负责的。所以那个时候我们的观察，这些高级干部是非常还是很自律的。为什么呢？他们大部分都是文革以后平反昭雪的，他们很多人都是在文革的时候受到冲击，然后又重新到这个位置上，或者是提升到这个位置上的。那时候在这个位置上的这些高官，他们是不仅非常自律，有紧迫感，用那时候的话来说，抓紧生命的最后时刻，不要辜负党和人民的信任，要很好的去尽职尽责。\n\n那么这个64一开枪，就把整个军队的性质给改变了，原来是一个为人民服务的，是保护人民的，是消灭外来敌人的。这样的军队职能变成一个对内去镇压老百姓，去杀害那些无辜的平民，特别是杀害那些六四提出的口号反腐败反官到的学生。他们反对你们阵营里面和在当时弥漫在社会上的一种贪污腐化的风气。你们要镇压这些人，那么你们倡导的是什么？这是所有的人都看明白了，那就是好多正直的干部觉得就特别失望，就认为中国没有希望了，好不容易在经过改革开放，大家对中国的那点发展的那点信心，一下被这64开枪就给泯灭了。所以那时候在这些高级干部和这些军队干部弥漫末日风气，大家认为世界怎么这么黑暗，简直就是到了世界末日了，正义没有了，邪恶在闪烁，而且那个邪恶是最大的一种邪恶。你说什么邪恶能够达到杀人嗜血的这种邪恶？\n\n在这样的一种气氛的笼罩之下，大家认为那我们现在干嘛呀？然后大家都说，那我们就现在赶紧能捞就捞。好一点的干部就是得过且过。那些恶的人，那些靠杀人上位的这些人，就是江泽民讲闷声发大财。所谓的闷声发财，就是偷偷的发财，能贪就贪，能捞就捞。不就倡导这样吗？\n\n江泽民那时候集党政军三个最高职务于一身，中央军委主席、国家主席、党的总书记。他说我们要闷声发大财，给干部传达的是什么样的信息啊？\n\n那就是或许在采访、在工作的时候，你可以任意的收取好处费，而且没有好处你就不干，就是我要采访你，你要给我钱，你不给我钱，那咱们免谈，那不就是这样吗？\n\n所以那时候对所有所有部门，从军队开始的那种污染就是这样的，而且那个64的时候，进行了一个大清洗，军队的高级干部就是以64划线，如果你不拥护这个屠杀，认为64不正义的话，你就要离开这个岗位，或者受到处分，包括我这样的一个记者，我看到了真相，我要说出来了，那么不行，你要离开这个岗位，从上到下都是这样。所以在这种清洗之下，你说这些干部能干的是什么？这个杀人都不是事，都可以掩盖造假，而且是最后的一层道德底线都没有了，你贪两个钱那算什么呀？那贪污跟这杀人比起来，那不算什么吧？有好多人贪污完了以后，他还会去贿赂他的那些领导的，我也让你有钱，你能罩着我，我就给你送钱。当时我们的一些记者在议论事情，就说从64以后，就是贪污腐败会特大行其道，大家底线都没有了都去贪钱，上梁不正下梁歪，军委领导就像这两个人都官至国防部部长了，都是军委副主席最高的这个级别了，你都在就是大肆的敛财，你说下面的人他们会怎么样？所以那时候军队就是从上到下都在贪污，贪污到了什么程度？给每一层都开出一个价码来，包括最小的班长。学习江泽民闷声发大财，这些人就靠着这个，然后就一步一步一步的上去。\n\n那时候我记得就是习近平刚上台的时候，把军队的两个副主席，一个是郭伯雄，一个是徐财厚，给拿下来了。抄到郭伯雄的时候，他的地下室，有几箱子都是没有开，其中有一个好像是四川省军区的政委给他送了几十万，那个箱子里连开都没开，就是给拿下来了。那个箱子打开的时候，里面有一张纸，说某人就是我四川省军区的政委，我希望你可以把我提到什么样的职位，这是公开的拿钱买官，都到了这种程度，各级的官员都是有价码的。\n\n我的一个朋友，我们一直在一起工作的，他亲口跟我讲的，他说本来按照他的职务继续上升到一个位置上，但是这高级机关的干部部门去跟他谈话，说你现在表现不错，我们准备提拔你，但是有一条你要拿多少多少钱。他一听就很生气，他说你不要这样侮辱我，我这样一步一步能够走到这个位置，我不是拿钱买的这个位置，我是靠我自己能力到这个位置上来的，你让我拿多少多少钱，绝对不可以。那个干部门的人公开跟他说，如果你不拿这个钱，这一次你不但不能提，你还可能在这个位置就休息吧，你就退休了。结果他就是坚持没有拿这个钱，结果这个位置果然没有给他，他就退休了，这都是真事。听起来都觉得像听新闻似的，但是在现实的军队当中，高级干部的提拔就是这样的。\n\n前两天我看到中央党校的蔡霞教授在接受好像是美国知音的记者访问的时候，她说这个党是非常坏的党，这个干部任免制度，是一个掐尖的这样的一个体制。她说她也是引用中央党校的一个老教授的话，就说这个党不可救药，干部制度非常腐败是一个原因。\n\n改革开放以后曾经动了这个干部制度，胡耀邦要进行改革干部制度，就是要把有能力的人，特别是有能力的年轻干部，要破格提拔他们。胡耀邦当总书记的时候，贯彻了这一条的，当时很多的年轻干部脱颖而出。但是到了六四以后，整个政治体制改革全部都停止了，大踏步向后退，就又退到过去，就是毛的那个时期，就按照他们这个路线那个来划线，所谓的路线划线实际上就是以人划线。路线是个虚的，这个路线我说你合格就合格，我说你不合格就是不合格。\n\n到了64以后，又重新倒退回去，拥护我的，你就可以上去；不拥护我的，那你就下来。所以从江泽民开始，腐败越来越严重，就是江泽民死的时候，好多人还为他摇旗呐喊。\n\n虽然习近平上台以后，他也一直在反腐，但是外界评论说他习近平的这个反腐，最终的目的、真实的目的是为了清除异己，他并不是真正的反腐。\n\n其实党内的腐败非常严重的，甚至就是李尚福和魏凤和，是习近平一手亲自提拔上来的。魏凤和在2019年的时候，接受外媒自由亚洲电台的采访的时候，他提到64，他特别认为做的很对，没有64镇压，就没有30年的改革。军人的职责是对外的，所有国家的军队的职责都是这样的。但是到64，魏凤和他自己先背叛的初心，整个都变了。\n\n我觉得这两个国航部长他们在接受审判的时候，可能他们心里都不服，这个背叛初心不是从我们开始的，如果从你们背叛初心程度来说，我不过就是贪污点，我没杀人，我比你还强呢。所以即使那两个人得到了审判，他们从心里来说也不会是服气的，因为他们心里明白并不是最厉害的。\n\n记者：当了这么多年的解放军报记者，你是否觉得中国军队已经烂腐透顶了？\n\n江林：对！当然是腐烂腐烂透顶了。习近平上台的时候，为什么大家都拥护他？因为他是举着反腐的旗帜上台的，所以，这是大家拥护他的一个最重要的原因。就觉得终于有个领导能够祭起这个腐败的旗帜，整顿这个国家，整顿这个军队了。当时觉得他是一种希望，所以很多人都拥护他，包括我自己在内。\n\n但是看到了他不是反腐，他是靠这个清洗上位并巩固他自己的权位。他还去修宪，把邓小平当时改革的，让大家最拥护的一条，领导人不要搞终身制，就是说所有的人都看到了毛的错误，但是谁也拿他没有办法。那么解决这个问题的关键一定要改革干部制度，第一条就是你不要一个人在这个台上搞终身制。就是向西方学习搞任期制，有这么一个制度，到了8年了，你干的不好了，你就自动下台，因为制度在这摆着。\n\n但是习近平最要命的是把最根本的东西，这一条改成他要终生制、中心制。他不死他要做到底，党政军第一把手他一直都要站在这个位置上。\n\n所以从这一点来看，他反腐就是假的，他就是为了自己上位，就是要站稳自己的脚跟。所谓的什么党不变色，国家不变色，军队不变色，那都是幌子。你一个人就代表了这个党、这个军队、这个国家？谁信他的？所谓的那几顶皇冠，什么中国人民的儿子，什么党的优秀的党员啊，都要盖棺论，什么东西就是什么东西。\n\n最近习近平特别去延安，召开了一个军队的政治工作会议，强调枪杆子要掌握在忠诚的、可靠的人手中，强调政治治军这一点。你认为指的是什么？他未来还会继续的清洗军队？\n\n我给你说就是我的老领导,我刚开始新闻工作的时候的老领导,他跟我说,你看人民日报,看共产党的报纸,你要反着看。什么叫反着看？就是他说什么强调什么的时候，那肯定是那个方面出问题了。比如他说党的关键时刻，什么国家的关键时刻，就是这个时候出问题了，他在国际上的威信也好，在党的微信上也好，在国家的微信上也好都出问题了，就是大家都在怀疑他，都在反对他。而且这是一个事实。\n\n如在香港的问题上，什么50年不变，你把香港安了一个国安法，现在香港的所有的法律都以国安法划线。你背叛你自己当初制定的跟英国签订的中英联合声明，公开违反国际法。然后对内在新疆你搞那种种族灭绝。在俄乌战争问题上，你又公开的站在俄方。\n\n台湾我让回归，要统一你。你不同意，尤其是民进党非常的明确提出来，我们实际从历史上就是互不隶属，我从来就没有隶属过你。从蔡英文开始到新的总统赖清德都是非常清楚的。所以他就很恼火，你不听我的话，那么我就要打你，用武力来来所谓的解放你。这是他的逻辑。\n\n记者：这样会不会很矛盾呢？一方面军队如此的腐败，都是买官卖官，还有什么战斗力。另一方面，习近平口口声声的说要武统台湾。到底他是想打，还是他自己也知道军队现在如此虚弱？\n\n江林：极权国家的领导人的思维不是正常人的思维。举个例子，第一次海湾战争的时候，萨达姆他想当阿拉伯之王，他怎么样当这个王呢？他就要跟美国打仗来说明自己，在这个战争当中立他这个王。这个和习近平很像。\n\n那时他的宣传部长，美国军队一直都开到他那屋里了，他还在说我们是战无不胜的。这些人临死他都不会嘴软，都要打口炮。习近平也是这样，他明明知道他自己的实力不能跟美国干一仗，但是他觉得他干台湾没有问题，就跟普京当初想他干乌克兰没有问题似的。普京在打这一仗的时候，他从来没有想到过乌克兰会反抗，而且会这么顽强的反抗，另外国际上56个国家支持乌克兰提供武器。他觉得两个小时就能解决问题。习近平不是也是这样吗？那些军头也玩命喊，我们两个小时就可以到台北喝茶了，都是非常狂妄。\n\n记者：习近平也亲眼看见俄乌战争僵持了这么久，到现在还没打下来，普京主动的去朝鲜求援。习近平他看到这一点，俄罗斯这么强大国家打乌克兰打得这么艰难，他会不会还是对此还是有所忌惮？对国际社会的制裁各方面有所忌惮？你怎么看这个问题？\n\n江林：从他的本质这一点来观察这个问题，前一段他对欧盟的主席冯德莱恩说，打台湾完全是美国的诱惑，诱骗我们去打台湾，我才不上他这个当。\n\n他为什么跟冯德莱恩说这个事呢？就是他在查两个军头，两任国防部长，然后发现这军队根本打不了仗，所以他要解放军打仗这是不可以的。\n\n这是回答他为什么在延安开会，强调军队在政治上要听党的，枪杆子要掌握在党的手里，你要坚决听我的话，不能背叛我。实际上也是说明他在这个问题上出问题了，而且是出了大问题了。所以火箭军从上到下整个的领导班子一窝端了。因为他要打台湾，首先就要靠火箭军，靠导弹打过去，他发现火箭军不行了。所以他把这整个的班子都给换掉了。可想而知他这个问题有多大。小道消息说他在准备这个战争的时候，发现火箭军连那个导弹发射井的井盖都打不开，井盖锈到一块去了。你想这问题多严重啊。这个军队干部都怎么上来的呀？就靠效忠，那个井盖锈不锈跟我没关系，干部谁去负责任啊？谁去带这个兵去啊？\n\n我父母都是住干休所的，有一次我去干休所跟司机聊天，那个小战士告诉我，这个车队好多人都不止开一辆车，开好多车，我们在车队开自己的车，他说我们都有自己的车。这个兵都是开着自己的车来当兵的，肯定这个兵家是有钱的，带着车来进北京，车上不得多装点钱呀。那些土大款让自己孩子当兵是为什么？他们觉得自己的孩子如果要有出息的话，在部队里混个一官半职，那样下面的人都不敢欺负你。送到野战军太辛苦了，把我儿子就累坏了怎么办，让我儿子当一个舒服一点的兵。那就是给首长开车的就比较舒服，不需要出操、摸爬滚打，练单兵技术，只要给首长开好车就行，怎么样能把这个首长伺候好，或把你的车开过去给他服务。\n\n因为后来有一些纪律，习近平上台以后，就是军车不能到处跑。比如军车开在歌厅、豪华饭店、豪华宾馆前面，然后被曝光说军队怎么怎么腐败。所以有一条纪律，军车都不能够开到那些地方去。所以这些兵就开着自己的车，叔叔阿姨你们要去哪，我可以带你们去，但是条件就是你们要给我说点好话，因为这些干休所都是高级军官，说话还是有用的呀。他叫志愿兵，那个时代都在6,000块钱以上，比当干部的，当排长的钱还要多一点。所以这些人通过这个方式，可以拿到很高的工资，尤其能留在部队的高级机关。所以这个都是腐败，兵都腐败到这种程度。而且再一条就是在这个体制里面，你想不腐败都不行。\n\n为什么不行呢？我也给你讲几个例子，你到了这个位置，你不要这个钱，这钱就给你送来了，你想不要都不行。所以你说一个用钱搞定的军队，他有战斗力吗？\n\n现在习近平他心知肚明，他其实非常清楚现在这个军队所谓的忠诚于党都成了一口号了，其实这也说明他没招了，回天无力了。\n\n你只要在这个党里待着，你只要在这个位置上，你都可以得到钱，就是这个制度当官的捷径，所以每一个干部被被拔下，被挖出来的时候，都是同一个罪行，魏凤和也好，李尚福也好，他们两个人都不在一个兵种，而且他们是两任的国防部长，但是他们为什么能够犯同样的错误，就是产生这个罪恶的体制和制度，决定了这些人就是这个样子。这个制度不改变，这些人避免不了。因为你这个体制是这样的，政治体制一点都没有变，整个干部晋升制度根本就没有改变。\n\n所以他这反腐反的什么，反腐的成效在什么地方？在这样的一个体制之下，各级军队战斗力在什么地方？现在就剩钱了，非常的可怕。\n\n你要统一，你那还不如别人，你要用你的劣质一人家那个优质可能吗？所以他要打仗和他能不能打仗完全是两回事。他现在没招了，所以就是在延安去开会，然后他要往回走。我觉得如果是但凡是一个军人，稍微正常一点，坐在延安的礼堂里面，开这样的一个会，听这样的一些话，有几个能觉得这样做真的能解决问题的。\n\n记者：最近中国多个省出现了一个叫\"警税合作作战中心\"，叫\"作战中心\"是不是把纳税人当成敌人了？\n\n江林：我真的觉得中国的那个荒谬，真的是越来越不像一个国家，所以什么乱七八糟的东西都提出来了，我就觉得他起码是他没钱了。你的纳税制度怎么不能解决这个问题，你还要去做什么战呢？你把这些企业家都当成敌人，那谁还敢跟你玩啊。\n\n你不但把外资吓跑，你也把自己人都吓跑了。凡是能在中国挣钱的人，一看到你这个作战都吓坏了，都得赶紧跑，再跑来不及了。他跟谁作战，他收税管谁收税？现在是倒查30年，所谓的作战部门要解决税的问题，所以你说那些人不跑还更待何时。\n\n记者\"肖然\n\n来源:看中国

        "summary": "The news article discusses the severe corruption within the Chinese military, as highlighted by former officer Jiang Lin, now residing in Canada. Two former Chinese Defense Ministers, Li Shangfu and Wei Fenghe, have been expelled from the Communist Party due to corruption and their cases have been handed over to military prosecutors. This is part of a broader purge within China's defense institutions since last summer, which has seen over a dozen senior military officials and defense industry executives removed from their positions.\n\nJiang Lin, a former journalist for the PLA Daily, asserts that the Chinese military is deeply corrupt and lacks combat effectiveness. She predicts that despite President Xi Jinping's ambitions to unify Taiwan by force, the military's current state makes this unlikely. The article also notes that Xi's anti-corruption campaign, despite some successes, struggles due to the lack of civilian oversight and an independent judiciary.\n\nThe article further details the backgrounds of Li Shangfu and Wei Fenghe, their roles in the military, and the corruption charges against them, which include bribery and abuse of power. Analysts suggest that the corruption within the military procurement system is extensive, potentially affecting the quality and reliability of key weapons.\n\nJiang Lin attributes the deep-rooted corruption to systemic issues dating back to the Tiananmen Square Massacre in 1989, which she believes fundamentally changed the nature of the Chinese military. She argues that the culture of corruption has only worsened over time, with high-ranking officials engaging in significant bribery and embezzlement.\n\nThe article concludes with Jiang Lin's view that the Chinese military is incapable of waging a successful war due to its corruption and lack of genuine combat readiness, despite Xi Jinping's rhetoric about military strength and unification with Taiwan."

什么中国人民的儿子，什么党的优秀的党员啊，都要盖棺论，什么东西就是什么东西。\n\n最近习近平特别去延安，召开了一个军队的政治工作会议，强调枪杆子要掌握在忠诚的、可靠的人手中，强调政治治军这一点。你认为指的是什么？他未来还会继续的清洗军队？\n\n我给你说就是我的老领导,我刚开始新闻工作的时候的老领导,他跟我说,你看人民日报,看共产党的报纸,你要反着看。什么叫反着看？就是他说什么强调什么的时候，那肯定是那个方面出问题了。比如他说党的关键时刻，什么国家的关键时刻，就是这个时候出问题了，他在国际上的威信也好，在党的微信上也好，在国家的微信上也好都出问题了，就是大家都在怀疑他，都在反对他。而且这是一个事实。\n\n如在香港的问题上，什么50年不变，你把香港安了一个国安法，现在香港的所有的法律都以国安法划线。你背叛你自己当初制定的跟英国签订的中英联合声明，公开违反国际法。然后对内在新疆你搞那种种族灭绝。在俄乌战争问题上，你又公开的站在俄方。\n\n台湾我让回归，要统一你。你不同意，尤其是民进党非常的明确提出来，我们实际从历史上就是互不隶属，我从来就没有隶属过你。从蔡英文开始到新的总统赖清德都是非常清楚的。所以他就很恼火，你不听我的话，那么我就要打你，用武力来来所谓的解放你。这是他的逻辑。\n\n记者：这样会不会很矛盾呢？一方面军队如此的腐败，都是买官卖官，还有什么战斗力。另一方面，习近平口口声声的说要武统台湾。到底他是想打，还是他自己也知道军队现在如此虚弱？\n\n江林：极权国家的领导人的思维不是正常人的思维。举个例子，第一次海湾战争的时候，萨达姆他想当阿拉伯之王，他怎么样当这个王呢？他就要跟美国打仗来说明自己，在这个战争当中立他这个王。这个和习近平很像。\n\n那时他的宣传部长，美国军队一直都开到他那屋里了，他还在说我们是战无不胜的。这些人临死他都不会嘴软，都要打口炮。习近平也是这样，他明明知道他自己的实力不能跟美国干一仗，但是他觉得他干台湾没有问题，就跟普京当初想他干乌克兰没有问题似的。普京在打这一仗的时候，他从来没有想到过乌克兰会反抗，而且会这么顽强的反抗，另外国际上56个国家支持乌克兰提供武器。他觉得两个小时就能解决问题。习近平不是也是这样吗？那些军头也玩命喊，我们两个小时就可以到台北喝茶了，都是非常狂妄。\n\n记者：习近平也亲眼看见俄乌战争僵持了这么久，到现在还没打下来，普京主动的去朝鲜求援。习近平他看到这一点，俄罗斯这么强大国家打乌克兰打得这么艰难，他会不会还是对此还是有所忌惮？对国际社会的制裁各方面有所忌惮？你怎么看这个问题？\n\n江林：从他的本质这一点来观察这个问题，前一段他对欧盟的主席冯德莱恩说，打台湾完全是美国的诱惑，诱骗我们去打台湾，我才不上他这个当。\n\n他为什么跟冯德莱恩说这个事呢？就是他在查两个军头，两任国防部长，然后发现这军队根本打不了仗，所以他要解放军打仗这是不可以的。\n\n这是回答他为什么在延安开会，强调军队在政治上要听党的，枪杆子要掌握在党的手里，你要坚决听我的话，不能背叛我。实际上也是说明他在这个问题上出问题了，而且是出了大问题了。所以火箭军从上到下整个的领导班子一窝端了。因为他要打台湾，首先就要靠火箭军，靠导弹打过去，他发现火箭军不行了。所以他把这整个的班子都给换掉了。可想而知他这个问题有多大。小道消息说他在准备这个战争的时候，发现火箭军连那个导弹发射井的井盖都打不开，井盖锈到一块去了。你想这问题多严重啊。这个军队干部都怎么上来的呀？就靠效忠，那个井盖锈不锈跟我没关系，干部谁去负责任啊？谁去带这个兵去啊？\n\n我父母都是住干休所的，有一次我去干休所跟司机聊天，那个小战士告诉我，这个车队好多人都不止开一辆车，开好多车，我们在车队开自己的车，他说我们都有自己的车。这个兵都是开着自己的车来当兵的，肯定这个兵家是有钱的，带着车来进北京，车上不得多装点钱呀。那些土大款让自己孩子当兵是为什么？他们觉得自己的孩子如果要有出息的话，在部队里混个一官半职，那样下面的人都不敢欺负你。送到野战军太辛苦了，把我儿子就累坏了怎么办，让我儿子当一个舒服一点的兵。那就是给首长开车的就比较舒服，不需要出操、摸爬滚打，练单兵技术，只要给首长开好车就行，怎么样能把这个首长伺候好，或把你的车开过去给他服务。\n\n因为后来有一些纪律，习近平上台以后，就是军车不能到处跑。比如军车开在歌厅、豪华饭店、豪华宾馆前面，然后被曝光说军队怎么怎么腐败。所以有一条纪律，军车都不能够开到那些地方去。所以这些兵就开着自己的车，叔叔阿姨你们要去哪，我可以带你们去，但是条件就是你们要给我说点好话，因为这些干休所都是高级军官，说话还是有用的呀。他叫志愿兵，那个时代都在6,000块钱以上，比当干部的，当排长的钱还要多一点。所以这些人通过这个方式，可以拿到很高的工资，尤其能留在部队的高级机关。所以这个都是腐败，兵都腐败到这种程度。而且再一条就是在这个体制里面，你想不腐败都不行。\n\n为什么不行呢？我也给你讲几个例子，你到了这个位置，你不要这个钱，这钱就给你送来了，你想不要都不行。所以你说一个用钱搞定的军队，他有战斗力吗？\n\n现在习近平他心知肚明，他其实非常清楚现在这个军队所谓的忠诚于党都成了一口号了，其实这也说明他没招了，回天无力了。\n\n你只要在这个党里待着，你只要在这个位置上，你都可以得到钱，就是这个制度当官的捷径，所以每一个干部被被拔下，被挖出来的时候，都是同一个罪行，魏凤和也好，李尚福也好，他们两个人都不在一个兵种，而且他们是两任的国防部长，但是他们为什么能够犯同样的错误，就是产生这个罪恶的体制和制度，决定了这些人就是这个样子。这个制度不改变，这些人避免不了。因为你这个体制是这样的，政治体制一点都没有变，整个干部晋升制度根本就没有改变。\n\n所以他这反腐反的什么，反腐的成效在什么地方？在这样的一个体制之下，各级军队战斗力在什么地方？现在就剩钱了，非常的可怕。\n\n你要统一，你那还不如别人，你要用你的劣质一人家那个优质可能吗？所以他要打仗和他能不能打仗完全是两回事。他现在没招了，所以就是在延安去开会，然后他要往回走。我觉得如果是但凡是一个军人，稍微正常一点，坐在延安的礼堂里面，开这样的一个会，听这样的一些话，有几个能觉得这样做真的能解决问题的。\n\n记者：最近中国多个省出现了一个叫\"警税合作作战中心\"，叫\"作战中心\"是不是把纳税人当成敌人了？\n\n江林：我真的觉得中国的那个荒谬，真的是越来越不像一个国家，所以什么乱七八糟的东西都提出来了，我就觉得他起码是他没钱了。你的纳税制度怎么不能解决这个问题，你还要去做什么战呢？你把这些企业家都当成敌人，那谁还敢跟你玩啊。\n\n你不但把外资吓跑，你也把自己人都吓跑了。凡是能在中国挣钱的人，一看到你这个作战都吓坏了，都得赶紧跑，再跑来不及了。他跟谁作战，他收税管谁收税？现在是倒查30年，所谓的作战部门要解决税的问题，所以你说那些人不跑还更待何时。\n\n欢迎给您喜欢的作者捐助。您的爱心鼓励就是对我们媒体的耕耘。\n\n来源:看中国\n\n短网址:

        "summary": "The news article discusses the severe corruption within the Chinese military, as highlighted by former officer Jiang Lin, now residing in Canada. Jiang Lin, a former journalist for the People's Liberation Army Daily, claims that the Chinese military is deeply corrupt and lacks combat effectiveness. This statement comes in the wake of the expulsion of two former Chinese Defense Ministers, Li Shangfu and Wei Fenghe, from the Communist Party due to corruption charges. These cases have been handed over to military prosecutors.\n\nSince last summer, a significant purge within China's defense institutions has led to the removal of over a dozen senior generals and military-industrial executives. This turmoil occurs as President Xi Jinping aims to strengthen China's military capabilities and assert its territorial claims.\n\nDespite Xi's decade-long anti-corruption campaign, the expulsion of these high-ranking officials, both of whom were personally promoted by Xi, underscores the persistent challenge of eradicating corruption at the top levels of the military. Analysts suggest that the lack of civilian oversight and an independent judiciary hampers effective anti-corruption measures within the military.\n\nThe article also touches on the broader implications of this corruption, including its impact on military readiness and Xi's ambitions regarding Taiwan. Jiang Lin predicts that the military's corruption and inefficiency make it unlikely that Xi would successfully use force to unify Taiwan. The article concludes with a discussion on the broader societal and political ramifications of this pervasive corruption within the Chinese military and government."

        "body": "上海合作组织（SCO）7月3日将在哈萨克斯坦首都阿斯塔纳举行第24届元首理事会会议。引人注目的是印度总理莫迪决定不出席此次上合组织峰会，改由外长苏杰生代表他与会。\n\n莫迪将于7月8日至9日对俄罗斯进行访问，并将与普京举行双边峰会。莫迪访问俄罗斯之后，据信还将于7月9日前往奥地利进行为期2天的访问。\n\n《印度教徒报》表示，莫迪之所以缺席上合组织峰会是因为他需要为出访俄罗斯和奥地利做准备，但是印度官方尚未就莫迪的两国之行做任何的正式宣布。\n\n《印度教徒报》说，此次上合组织峰会预计将聚焦地区安全局势以及如何提升成员国之间的联系和贸易。峰会将讨论阿富汗局势、乌克兰战争以及如何提升成员国之间的安全合作。\n\n\"出席上合组织峰会的印度代表团将由外交部长苏杰生率领，\"印度外交部发言人兰德希尔·贾斯瓦尔（Randhir Jaiswal）在上周五举行的记者会上宣布。\n\n据《今日印度》报道，莫迪原先已经证实将出席此次峰会，并且已经开始启动安全措施。但是后来在做了进一步评估后改变了主意。\n\n成立于1996年的上合组织目前拥有九个正式成员国，除了中国、俄罗斯和印度外，还有哈萨克斯坦、吉尔吉斯斯坦、塔吉克斯坦、乌兹别克、巴基斯坦和伊朗。该组织还有蒙古、白俄罗斯和塔利班三个观察员和13个对话伙伴。\n\n俄罗斯支持白俄罗斯加入上合组织，白俄罗斯预计将成为第10个正式会员国。\n\n印度总理通常都会出席上合组织峰会。莫迪此次虽然不能与会，却在星期二（2日）与哈萨克斯坦总统托卡耶夫通了电话，对哈萨克斯坦此次成功举办上合组织峰会表示完全的支持。\n\n【图：莫迪不久前刚刚接待了美国总统国家安全顾问沙利文】\n\n至于莫迪缺席峰会的原因，印方放出的消息是日程安排与国内议会有冲突。虽然这个理由从表面来看也勉强说得过去。但我们也知道，实际情况肯定是没有这么简单的。\n\n从目前来看，莫迪的缺席确实会对上合组织造成一定影响。再怎么说，印度都是大国，莫迪的缺席对本次上合峰会以及组织之后的工作，不会是好事。\n\n分析认为，最关键的一点，即印度并不想彻底和中俄站在同一条战线上。其所希望的是利用这种在中俄与西方之间，巧妙维持平衡的办法，有效为其更大的发展空间和积极权。\n\n俄乌战争爆发后，印度无视美西方制裁，加大同俄方的能源合作；但同时，印度也想加大西方国家的往来力度，吸引西方对印投资，并且通过加大国防和军事合作，实现对中国的制衡。",

        "title": "美国为何要与中国竞争？布林肯道出原因：仅美有资格塑造全球未来_手机网易网",
        "body": "根据法媒报道，当地时间7月1日，美国国务卿布林肯在华盛顿参加由布鲁金斯学会主办的美国外交政策对话会，在会上，布林肯就30多次提到中国，妄称中国希望成为国际体系中的主导国家，但中国对未来的愿景与全球其他国家不同，因此美国要挺身而出，和中国\"激烈竞争\"，确保美国才是真正塑造未来的国家。\n\n这话说得很文绉绉的，翻译成大白话其实就只有一句，西方国家不愿看到中国的崛起，因此美国将代表全世界挺身而出，遏制中国的崛起。\n\n为了论证自身的观点，布林肯还特别谈到俄乌战争，他说中国对俄罗斯的\"支持\"，是俄罗斯能够继续发展本国国防工业，维持高强度战争的关键原因，中国正扮演着\"推波助澜的角色\"。\n\n但是按照布林肯的逻辑来说，如果中国发展俄罗斯的外交关系，推动中俄双边贸易就是对俄罗斯的支持的话。那么美国推动北约东扩，导致俄罗斯地缘安全利益受损最终引发这场俄乌战争，那是不是意味着美国才是全球安全的最不稳定因素呢？所以，布林肯的这番表态，本质上就是以己之矛攻己之盾。\n\n除此之外，还有两个最大的问题，那就是美国能不能代表全世界，美国对未来的愿景是否与其他国家相符？\n\n这个答案用脚趾头都能想得明白。西方国家一共只有22个，组成了以美国为核心的西方体系，即便是在统一体系下，有的国家比如法国，一直和美国不太对付，布林肯如何用西方体系代表全球国家，难不成在布林肯的眼中，西方国家就是全世界，其他更广大的国家只是附庸，代表不了世界？\n\n除此之外，从全球范围来看，美国是否真的代表了全球国家的利益？这个答案显然也是否定的。二战后，美国的发家史本质上就是一部全球战争压迫史，均是以从自身利益出发，对全球秩序进行构建，而这对应的就是对其他国家的压迫和掠夺，共赢一词，在美国看来就是自己要赢两次。\n\n二战后，美国在全球范围内打入了三根楔子。分别是欧洲、中东以及东亚。\n\n美国在欧洲打入的一根楔子就是英国，因为英国的大陆均势政策与美国的欧洲利益相似，目的就是搅乱欧洲，避免出现一个统一的欧洲。加上美国推动马歇尔计划，推动欧洲经济的快速发展，逐渐拿到了欧洲的舆论控制，具体来说就是美国思想、影视文化在欧洲大行其道，从而构建了一整套所谓的\"普世价值\"的东西，再利用苏联的战略安全威胁，从而成功将欧洲绑上了战车，并以此作为自己的基本盘在全球范围内\"开疆拓土\"。现在的欧洲依然缺乏\"独立自主\"的能力，这也是法国总和美国唱反调的原因，因为法国希望建立一个\"独立自主\"的欧盟。\n\n在东亚也是如此，日本和英国相似，同样是一个离岛国家。只不过战败国的身份导致日本难以有所作为，所以就成了美国介入东亚问题的一块跳板，手不仅仅伸向了南海、台海、蒙古，同时还把手伸到了东南亚，恨不得把西太平洋搅得天翻地覆。\n\n而在中东地区并不存在\"离岛\"，既然没有地理意义上的离岛，那就建立一个政治意义的离岛，以色列应运而生，从此之后阿拉伯国家与以色列的斗争不死不休，五次中东战争直接导致中东再也无力抵挡美国的强大攻势。同时美国还利用什叶派和逊尼派之间的矛盾冲突，瓦解中东国家之间的团结，为美国称霸中东提供内部条件。\n\n在美国主导这一全球地缘政治格局中，不少国家日子过得可以说是每况愈下，战争与冲突在世界范围内此起彼伏，从而有一日停歇，苏联解体后有海湾战争，伊拉克战争、阿富汗战争，最近还有叙利亚战争、以及正在进行的巴以冲突和俄乌战争。\n\n除此之外，中东地区爆发的阿拉伯之春、中亚也有橙色革命、 以及各种代理人战争，甚至美国还和ISIS、库尔德等组织有着各种密切的联系，难不成美国所主导的世界，就应该是这个样子？\n\n另外美国所主导的美元霸权，以控制全球贸易货币为手段，推动美元潮汐，通过货币的流动对全球国家进行收割。\n\n从以上种种，美国所主导的全球秩序，根本不是一个符合绝大部分国家利益的良好秩序，用一句话来说就是\"天下苦美久矣\"。\n\n所以说，布林肯口中的要为全球国家挺身而出，本身就是一个伪命题，美国除了能代表自己外，甚至连西方世界都无法完全代表，又何来的代表全世界？更别说布林肯表示要保证美国才是塑造未来的国家，这话恐怕全球90%以上的国家都不会赞同。因为有句话说得好：美国塑造过战争，饥饿，疾病，死亡，就是没塑造过全人类的美好未来。",

        "summary": "On July 1, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke at a foreign policy forum in Washington, hosted by the Brookings Institution. Blinken emphasized the need for the U.S. to \"fiercely compete\" with China, claiming that China aims to dominate the international system with a vision different from other global nations. He argued that only the U.S. is qualified to shape the future of the world.\n\nBlinken also linked China's support for Russia to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, suggesting that China's actions enable Russia to sustain its defense industry and high-intensity warfare. This stance was criticized as hypocritical, given the U.S.'s role in NATO expansion, which has been seen as a factor in the conflict.\n\nThe article questions whether the U.S. can truly represent global interests, noting that the Western bloc, led by the U.S., consists of only 22 countries. It argues that the U.S. has historically pursued its own interests at the expense of global stability, citing its influence in Europe, East Asia, and the Middle East, and its role in various conflicts and wars post-World War II.\n\nThe piece concludes that Blinken's assertion that the U.S. should shape the future is a flawed premise, as the U.S. has often contributed to global strife rather than universal prosperity."

        "title": "俄罗斯没有其他选择，翻倍进口中国先进设备，为军工业博个机会_手机网易网",
        "body": "俄罗斯作为前苏联的一员，在苏联解体后继承了大量军工遗产，可以说是不折不扣的军工大国。\n\n不过，武器储备再多也禁不住战争消耗，随着时间的推移，俄罗斯在军工方面暴露的短板越来越多。尤其在美欧各种出口管制下，俄罗斯军工业发展寸步难行。\n\n为了摆脱出口管制困局，俄罗斯选择了加深与中国的合作，为军工业博个机会。俄罗斯军工业为何面临困局？为何要加深与中国合作？\n\n俄罗斯的困境\n\n事实上，很多人都会有个疑问，继承了前苏联的大部分\"遗产\"的俄罗斯军工业，发展了几十年怎么反而一落千丈呢？\n\n提起来苏联，大家自然而然就会联想到\"钢铁洪流\"，1981年苏联组织的\"西方-81\"军事演习，漫山遍野的重型坦克刷新了全球国家的认知。\n\n我国深刻意识到实力的重要性，开始埋着头搞研发，北约成员国更是被吓破了胆。\n\n当时美国总统直接表态：\"如果这时苏联向美国发起进攻，美国将毫无抵抗之力。\"\n\n二十世纪八十年代，苏联的钢铁产量达到了1.48亿吨，超过美国43%，坦克年产量已经达到了2000辆以上，平均仅需7小时就可以造出一枚导弹。\n\n完善的军工产业就像一台精密的机器，不断生产着各类装备，给苏联套上了一层坚不可摧的外壳。\n\n但是随着苏联的解体，原本庞大且完善的军工体系只能被拆分，俄罗斯虽然继承到了70%左右的军工业，但这个体系是残缺的，残缺的军工体系和没有几乎没什么区别。\n\n再加上苏联解体时原本就乱成了一团麻，经济惨不忍睹。俄罗斯政府实行\"休克疗法\"，想要拯救不断下滑的经济，没想到毫无效果，经济直接跌入谷底。\n\n残缺的军工体系再加上没有资金搞研发，如此天崩般的开局，俄罗斯想要发展军工也是有心无力，于是俄罗斯军工的发展就偏向了\"考古式\"研究。\n\n从久久未决的俄乌战争可以看出来，俄罗斯所用的装备还是几十年前的产物，如KH-22空地导弹。\n\n即使这样产能也完全跟不上需求，由于缺乏武器，俄罗斯不得不将价格不菲的S-300防空导弹当远程火箭弹用。\n\n除此之外，俄罗斯生产的炮弹还遭到炮兵部队的控诉，称炮弹误差大，质量有问题，这意味着什么？\n\n意味着现有的生产设备已经完全不能满足需求，数控机床需要更新换代了。此前，俄罗斯进口机床的主要来源国是德国、日本等国家。\n\n俄乌战争爆发后，美国宣布在国防、航空航天、工业等领域对俄罗斯实行\"最全面的出口管制\"，限制俄罗斯的进出口贸易，也就是说俄罗斯将面临着有钱也没有地方买的状况。\n\n一方面是国内沉疴宿疾的军工业，一方面是美欧各种出口管制，俄罗斯该如何破局呢？\n\n中国是解局关键\n\n科学技术是第一生产力，唯有不断发展高新技术产业，才能使国家发展形成良性循环。\n\n俄罗斯的经济贸易结构以能源出口为主，在工业和科技创新方面是比较薄弱的，高科技产品高度依赖进口。\n\n根据研究数据显示，俄罗斯每年的高科技产品进口贸易额在190亿美元左右，其中45%来自欧盟，21%来自美国，11%来自中国。\n\n从数据可以直观看到，美欧为首的全面制裁对俄罗斯还是存在不小影响的。不过这也并非是一盘死棋，中国便是俄罗斯突破封锁的关键，俄罗斯也将所有的宝都压在了中国身上。\n\n根据俄罗斯媒体的报道，如今俄企正在逐步用中国产品替代\"不友好国家\"的产品。目前在设备市场上，有七成左右的俄罗斯企业选择\"中国制造\"，并且未来这个占比还会更高。\n\n盖达尔经济研究所针对1000所俄罗斯企业开展了调查问卷，结果显示中国已经成为俄企最受欢迎的新渠道。\n\n从2022年开始，中俄贸易额持续增长，光是2022年一年，中国对俄罗斯出口总额同比增长12.8%，高达716亿美元，并且还在不断扩大贸易种类，增加了挖掘机、山地车、装载机、起重机等，甚至还有数控机床。\n\n面对美欧对数控机床的出口管制，俄罗斯并没有选择妥协，而是扭头寻找中国合作。\n\n根据英国《金融时报》的报道，俄乌冲突爆发后，中俄数控机床的贸易额暴涨10倍，从冲突前的650万美元左右涨到了6800万美元。\n\n2023年底，俄国防部长绍伊古在对特别军事行动进行总结时表示，如今俄罗斯军工产业的产量正在稳步提升，炮弹产能增加了17.5倍，完全不会出现炮弹打完的情况。\n\n可以看出，中俄深度合作带来的是双赢的结果，俄罗斯能源多，工业基础薄弱，缺少各类技术设备；而我国缺少能源，并且作为全球唯一一个全产业链的国家，能够完美满足俄罗斯的需求。\n\n美欧等国退出俄罗斯数控机床市场，为我国数控机床走出去提供了一个绝佳的机会。\n\n我国工业发展晚，数控机床技术起步同样也慢一步，哪怕现在数控机床技术已经达到市场需求，但也很难在已经固定的市场上分一块蛋糕。\n\n如今美欧主动退出，留出一个空位置，我们自然要把握机会，填补俄罗斯市场的空缺。\n\n随着中俄不断加深合作，会给双方共同带来新的发展和机遇，实现双赢。",

The core inflation rate, excluding volatile items like energy and food, remained steady at 2.9%, slightly above expectations. The Eurozone's inflation had peaked at 10.6% in June 2022 due to the Russia-Ukraine war, leading to unprecedented rate hikes by the ECB.

        "body": "中国和菲律宾在南中国海情势紧张。菲媒6月30日报道，菲律宾参谋总长表示，一旦战争爆发，不论是菲律宾或其他大国都是输家。专家认为，尽管该区域局势紧张，引发全面战争的可能性并不高。\n\n双方重点均为发展经济 将寻求协商与谈判解决问题\n\n中国与菲律宾近来屡在南中国海仁爱暗沙附近爆发冲突，被形容为恐发生战争的热点之一。根据菲律宾军方上周公布的一段影片显示，中国海警和菲律宾军方船只在6月17号发生激烈冲撞。双方互相指责是挑起争端的一方。马尼拉指责中国船只冲撞菲律宾船只，并且\"登船抢夺武器\"；中方则反指菲律宾船只故意危险接近中方正常航行船只。\n\n菲律宾军队参谋总长布劳纳（Romeo Brawner）6月29日表示，国家面临挑战，有必要加强后备力量，\"为任何可能发生的情况做好准备\"，但他否认媒体报导指这些秀肌肉动作是为应对与中国加剧的敌对行动所做的准备。他指出，马尼拉正在尽一切努力避免战争。\n\n布劳纳表示，菲律宾总统小马科斯已指示\"用尽一切可能措施和行动以防止战争\"，但命令菲律宾武装部队要确保菲国在专属经济区（EEZ）得以维护主权，菲方将遵循国际法，并促进基于国际规则的秩序。\n\n在菲律宾的地缘政治分析师兼菲律宾－中东研究协会（PMESA）南亚及东南亚研究主任唐·麦克莱恩·吉尔(Don McLain Gill)认为，中国持续引起海域冲突之目有几项。他向美国之音指出，中国正在试图透过挑战马尼拉维护主权的决心，并不断测试菲国与盟友之间的合作，以此迫使菲律宾屈服于北京，让出菲国在西菲律宾海的利益。他表示，中国很可能会将 6 月 17 日的挑衅行为常态化，中菲将陷入僵局。\n\n印太军事专家，台湾开南大学国家与区域发展研究中心主任陈文甲在接受美国之音采访时表示，中菲两国在主权争议上向来不愿意轻易让步，因为中菲的纷争涉及国家主权、民族自尊、战略利益以及经济资源等。他认为，毕竟中菲两国都需要维持稳定的经济发展，战争会对双方经济造成严重打击，因此尽管最近南中国海局势紧张，引发全面战争的可能性相对较低。\n\n陈文甲说:\"中国作为全球第二大经济体，不愿因战争而破坏其经济发展大局。而菲律宾则在军事上处于劣势，不愿冒险挑起大规模战争。\"\n\n陈文甲认为，近期的冲突将会让中菲双方更坚定各自的立场，增加谈判的难度。\n\n台湾国际战略学会信赖研究中心主任黄惠华指出，基于《南中国海各方行为宣言》（Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea），既然中国与东盟均承诺使用公认的国际法原则管理国家间关系，还是会设法以和平方式解决争端。\n\n她告诉美国之音:\"中菲冲突目前处于\"低强度的冲突\"状态，没有出现军事动员、军事对抗、或者展示武力的行为，因此并未构成充分战端。《南海(南中国海)各方行为宣言》虽然无法消除海上冲突、摩擦与争执，但是能够用来限制战争。\"\n\n黄惠华表示，中菲依然或透过协商及谈判解决问题，特别是当俄罗斯在俄乌战争迟迟未解时，发展重心被迫从欧洲移往太平洋，促使南中国海的势力达到平衡，也同时降低了中菲之间爆发战争的指数。\n\n黄惠华认为，虽然南中国海并非俄罗斯的传统战略重点，俄罗斯也不是南中国海的\"协调者\"，但也因此基于不干涉原则，俄罗斯设法维持与南中国海周边各国的友好关系，主张和平解决南中国海争议，企图扮演南中国海和平的贡献者。\n\n她说:\"俄罗斯的策略也刺激中国与其他国家的军备竞赛与资源争夺。这种两面讨好的策略让中国不满，然而其他国家也乐见俄罗斯稀释中国与美国势力并且互相牵制，让南海(南中国海)局势处于平衡状态。\"\n\n黄惠华指出，即使中国是俄罗斯的盟国，俄罗斯也会优先考虑全球战略利益。\n\n驻菲律宾地缘政治分析师唐．麦克莱恩．吉尔表示，莫斯科与亚洲国家的接触确实愈发频繁，然而基于俄罗斯主张不干涉原则，对南中国海的影响有限。他认为，俄罗斯在南中国海争议上是边缘角色，只是与马来西亚、越南等国家推动双边关系，其影响力无论在经济或军事上都与美中相去甚远，特别是入侵乌克兰之后，更失去了在领土主权上发言的正当性，根本不足以稀释美中在南中国海的势力。\n\n美国重申支持菲国 多重管道强化对华威慑力\n\n美国国务卿布林肯6月19日针对中国在南中国海的各项\"升级\"行动，与菲律宾外交部长马纳罗（Enrique Manalo）通话进行讨论，强调美国对《美菲共同防御条约》承诺仍坚如盘石;美国副国务卿坎贝尔（Kurt Campbell）6月27日与中国副外长马朝旭通电话，对中国在南中国海的\"不稳定行为\"表示担忧，并且重申对菲国的支持。\n\n台湾开南大学国家与区域发展研究中心主任陈文甲表示，美国及其盟友在南中国海纷争中的介入方式十分多样，首先是重申海牙常设国际仲裁法院对南中国海仲裁案的裁决之正当性，以及利用联合国和东盟等国际组织的平台让中国感到被孤立的压力，同时也实施经济上的两手策略。\n\n他说:\"美国及其盟友将考虑实施经济制裁，限制中国企业在国际市场上的活动，从而对中国施加经济压力，迫使其在南海(南中国海)问题上更加谨慎。此外，美国也将加强对菲律宾的经济援助。\"\n\n陈文甲在设法促使菲国减少其对中国经济的依赖之同时，也增加菲国与日本、澳大利亚等盟友的联合军演次数和强度，才能对中国达到一定的威慑效果，减少其冒险行动的可能性，以避免中美之间的军事对抗风险。\n\n台湾国际战略学会信赖研究中心主任黄惠华表示，菲律宾与中国之间的不对称军事实力需要落实在许多层面，才会形成足够的威慑力。\n\n她说:\"美菲｀综合性威慑战略＇是否有效，关键在于菲律宾军事现代化是否能取得先进军备以及与盟国建立多重的政治与军事合作，包含各种军事技术合作、军演、各个双边与多边联盟互赖同盟关系。\"\n\n黄惠华指出，美国正在调整印太战略，就是希望遏制中国的威胁，达到\"亚洲安全，美国才能安全\"双向安全保障的战略意涵。\n\n小马科斯政府多元抗中措施\n\n菲律宾总统小马科斯6月23日在慰问菲律宾官兵时强调，菲律宾不会被任何人吓倒。他说: \"我们冷静和平的态度不应被误解为默许。\"同时，他希望和平解决南中国海争端。\n\n台湾开南大学国家与区域发展研究中心主任陈文甲表示，面对中国在外交和军事上的强势行动，小马科斯政府可能会采取一系列新的应对措施，除了购买更多巡航导弹、防空系统和海军舰艇等先进军事装备，同时也会增加海上巡逻力度，通过定期巡逻展示主权，甚至在战略要地建立新的军事基地。此外，他指出小马科斯政府一直致力于加强菲国的经济实力，为国防和外交提供坚实基础。\n\n他说:\"菲律宾政府将推动经济多元化，减少对中国市场和投资的依赖，通过加强与其他国家的经贸合作，提升经济的独立性。另一方面，菲律宾政府将促进国内产业升级，提升制造业、科技和基础设施建设。\"\n\n驻菲律宾地缘政治分析师唐·麦克莱恩·吉尔认为，其他的补充措施也能产生对中国的吓阻力，例如驱逐中国驻马尼拉的使节，使用更大更快的船只执行补给任务，为菲国船员配备非致命装备，以及为海上非传统小冲突提供训练。\n\n台湾国际战略学会信赖研究中心主任黄惠华指出，菲国正积极地与美国之外的伙伴建立更紧密的关系，例如澳大利亚、日本、欧盟、韩国的安全合作，而这些国家愿意提供菲律宾各种军事服务，包括官员互访、武器军售、军事援助、双边及多边联合军演、演训、军事技术转移、提供盟国使用菲律宾军事基地、港口等。她说，小马科斯深深了解合作力量可防止敌对势力坐大，如果中国破坏国际规则的话，也必须面对强大的敌对的美日及同盟势力。",

        "summary": "The article discusses the escalating tensions between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea, particularly around the Ren'ai Shoal. On June 17, a collision occurred between Chinese coast guard and Philippine military vessels, with both sides blaming each other for the incident. Despite the heightened tensions, experts believe the likelihood of a full-scale war is low due to the economic interests of both nations.\n\nKey figures include Philippine military chief Romeo Brawner, who emphasized the need for preparedness but denied that recent military actions were aimed at China. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has instructed efforts to avoid war while maintaining sovereignty in the country's exclusive economic zone (EEZ).\n\nExperts like Don McLain Gill and Chen Wenjia suggest that China aims to test the Philippines' resolve and its alliances, but both countries prefer economic stability over conflict. The Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea is seen as a framework to manage disputes peacefully.\n\nThe U.S. has reiterated its support for the Philippines, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell expressing concerns over China's actions. The U.S. and its allies are employing various strategies, including economic sanctions and military aid, to deter China.\n\nThe Marcos administration is also pursuing diversified economic and military strategies, including strengthening ties with other countries like Japan, Australia, and the EU, to reduce dependence on China and enhance national defense capabilities."

        "body": "吉林大学德国教授杜本因为接受《美国之音》访问时，分析习近平今年5月访欧的企图和助俄入侵乌克兰，遭到中国当局强迫离职并被永久驱逐出境。杜本认为，该访谈是导致其遭中共报复的导火线。海外大学学者指，中国大学已变成党性十足的机构，并警示还想与中国密切合作的外国学者放弃幻想。\n\n《美国之音》上周六（6月29日）报道，中国吉林大学公共外交学院国际关系研究所外籍教授杜本（Björn Alexander Düben），因接受《美国之音》采访评论习近平的访欧之旅，遭中共当局驱逐。\n\n据悉，杜本持有中国当局签发的高级外国人才签证（R-Visa），有效期至2033年。在被驱逐前，他已在吉林大学工作了9年。\n\n吉林大学派出学院党委书记和行政人员通知杜本，其原来的签证被取消，转为「人道主义」签证，并要求其两星期内离开中国；其后，校方再以「无可用教室」，于5月15日取消了杜本当天的讲座；其后他再接获同事通知，其所有讲座和课程教学都被无限期取消，在吉林大学的工作也将终止。\n\n但校方管理人员给出两个方案：第一个是让杜本主动向大学递交辞职信；另一个是接受纪律调查或法庭审判。因担心对解聘提出异议会带来风险，杜本不得已选择「辞职」。随后，校方通知其必须在5月30日前离开中国，并告知如果他今后再想来中国，会被拒绝入境。校方人员称「这是上面的指示，没有商量馀地」。\n\n《美国之音》透露杜本已经回到德国，本台查询后发现，吉林大学官方网站已经删除了杜本的简介。\n\n杜本直指习近平访欧　意在分化欧美关系及试探欧盟内部裂痕\n\n杜本认为，招致他遭中共当局报复的导火线应该是他在《美国之音》5月11日发表的文章中所做的评论，对习近平睽违5年的访欧之旅，杜本直指习近平访欧意在分化欧美关系以及试探欧盟内部的裂痕。\n\n杜本表示：「在美国与欧盟之间打入一个楔子毫无疑问是北京的长期基本目标之一，也可能是习近平亲自出访的原因之一。多年来，中国不断尝试让欧洲国家摆脱与美国的联盟关系，但迄今为止收效甚微......另一个潜在动机可能是试图确定欧盟内部可能存在多大程度的裂痕，特别是在其对北京的立场方面。」\n\n杜本也警告：「法国与其他西方国家之间的任何潜在分歧都不应该被夸大，习近平的行程上有趣的遗漏了布鲁塞尔，他很可能故意忽略了这一点。虽然马克龙邀请了欧委会主席冯德莱恩前往巴黎参加了与（与习近平的）会谈。」\n\n习近平访欧时，法国总统马克龙及冯德莱恩促进其明确在俄乌战争中的角色；早前美国国防部揭中国向俄罗斯提供军用零件、技术等。\n\n杜本也在《美国之音》的访谈中指出这个问题，他强调：「俄罗斯目前最需要的零件是中国能够提供但难以追踪的特定军民两用零件。迄今为止，习近平并没有在这里做出切实的让步，而是只是试图将乌克兰持续流血事件的责任，从中国（和俄罗斯）身上转移到美国身上，在这方面，我认为欧洲人在打破中国与普京领导下的俄罗斯的牢固联系方面，不会取得多大成果。」\n\n评论：杜本点到习近平访欧之旅最忌讳的两点\n\n法国塞尔奇．蓬多瓦兹大学教授张伦向本台表示，杜本点到了习近平访欧之旅最忌讳的两点，包括离间欧美关系，及其在俄乌战争中助纣为虐。\n\n张伦说：「这样的一个外籍教授对中共的外交、尤其是习近平进行评论，甚至有一些批评，尤其是这样两个敏感的外交议题，一个是中欧关系、欧美关系；另外一个也是非常敏感，就是中国在俄乌战争当中，具体支持俄方军事备件等，现在已经越来越清楚，但是学者做这样的评论，北京肯定是比较恼怒的。」\n\n张伦也指，中共不但严厉管控自己的学者，当外籍学者加入中国大学后，也会受到同样的对待。\n\n张伦说：「这样一个事件并不让我感到意外、吃惊。外面的学者、西方的学者评论，因为中共鞭长莫及，大概也没有办法。那么你现在我的治下，即便这位学者是以非常客观的角度来看这个问题，谈不上了。」\n\n评论：中国高校早已在习近平执政后转为「姓党」\n\n曾在美国能源部下辖实验室任职的华裔学者Vader在接受本台采访时表示，中国高校已不再是教育和学术机构，早已在习近平执政后转为「姓党」。\n\nVader说：「吉林大学外籍助理教授因发表对习近平访欧评论而遭解职一事其实并不新鲜，因为在中国所谓高等教育和研究机构，尤其社科领域，本质就是为意识形态服务，在中国领导人大搞个人崇拜之时，更是会为领袖个人服务。」\n\nVader 也认为，事件也为可能对中国心存幻想的海外学者敲响警钟。\n\nVader说：「另一方面，这事件也为对心存幻想、乃至有意想拍中国政府马屁的欧美学者敲响了警钟，即在中国这个本质法无定法的社会，你的言论稍微不符合当局要求和心意，无论你是不是『中国人民的老朋友』，都会被当局铁拳。」\n\n杜本拥有伦敦政经学院国际关系学博士学位和牛津大学国际关系学硕士学位，在去中国工作之前曾就职于伦敦大学国王学院和伦敦政治经济学院，他亦曾在《路透社》等多家主流媒体和智库平台发表研究成果。\n\n近年来， 中国当局在大学高薪引进外籍学者，也透过发放奖学金吸引海外留学生进入中国大学。在中国的外国学者鲜少批评中共当局，大多扮演为中共「洗地」的角色，曾在清华大学毕业的希腊籍博士生、清华大学苏世民书院客座助理教授齐思源（Vasilis Trigkas）就曾大赞习近平的「新质生产力」概念。\n\n而在清华大学，2018年夏，德国留学生穆达伟（David Missal）因声援「709律师」和拍摄「709妻子」维权纪录片，遭驱逐出境。\n\n记者：吴亦桐、宋子杰（伦敦）　编辑：施芷珊",

        "body": "打不过要谈判？泽连斯基向普京求饶，北约一把手血口喷中国\n\n美国和北约一手导演了俄乌冲突，就是想通过战争灭亡俄罗斯，之后就能集中精力对付下一个对手--中国了。然而事与愿违，俄罗斯不仅没有完蛋，反而越打越强，目前牢牢掌控了战争主动权，距离取得胜利不远了。在这种情况下，北约竟然迁怒于中国，污蔑中国是俄乌冲突的制造者，简直岂有此理。这到底是怎么一回事儿呢？\n\n首先，泽连斯基考虑与俄罗斯谈判！\n\n日前乌克兰总统泽连斯基接受西方媒体采访时表示，可以通过第三方调解与俄罗斯实现谈判。因为\"黑海粮食走廊\"协议就是在联合国、土耳其的斡旋下与俄罗斯签署的。未来与俄谈判的第三方调解者可以是美国和西欧国家，也可以是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲等其他地区的国家。\n\n此前泽连斯基可是一口咬定称，只要普京继续执政，就绝不谈判，怎么现在态度却发生了180度大转弯呢？其实不难理解，主要是俄罗斯在乌东战场取得了优势。比如在哈尔科夫和顿涅茨克方向，俄乌战损比为1：6，此外\"爱国者\"导弹防御系统无法有效应对俄航空制导炸弹和滑翔炸弹，而且使用成本高昂。\n\n但这不是最狠的，更狠的是在过去一天内，乌军损失了2025名军人。按照这个减员幅度，再有10天就会有2万乌军战死。这对于严重缺兵缺武器的乌军而言，简直是一种沉重打击。\n\n泽连斯基引导乌军抵抗俄军的终极目标就是保住自己的政治地位和数十亿亿美元财富，所以没必要与俄罗斯拼个你死我活。再加上他的总统任期早已到头，国内反对声音巨大，泽连斯基于是产生了明哲保身的念头。\n\n何况，俄罗斯并没有关闭谈判大门，普京一再强调，与乌克兰的谈判可随时开启。因此，泽连斯基觉得到了与俄罗斯谈判，全身而退的时候了。所以现在泽连斯基要做的就是，给美俄制造一个接触谈判的机会，让他们自己谈谈怎么结束战争，自己就不用背负战争罪的黑锅了。\n\n其次，眼看俄乌要开始谈判，北约着急了，北约秘书长斯托尔滕贝格声称中国煽动了俄乌冲突。\n\n日前北约秘书长斯托尔滕贝格对日本媒体说，中国\"煽动了俄乌战争\"，并说中国是俄罗斯持续作战的重要支持者。在没有任何证据的情况下，斯托尔滕贝格就血口喷人指责中国，无疑会让想到北约的下一个对手就是中国。\n\n在笔者看来，这其实是一种潜意识，说明北约早就讨论过如何在收拾俄罗斯的同时对付中国的议题，并且早就有了应对预案。斯托尔滕贝格声称，北约要和日韩澳新等亚太国家合作，一起应对中国，这样有利于维护美西方主导的国际规则。\n\n这种预案，一则是凸显美西方的优越感，二则是给北约壮胆增加对抗中国的信心。这必须引起我们的高度警惕，我们必须要为与北约发生冲突做一些准备。\n\n目前，美日韩同盟已经基本成型，它是亚太北约的雏形，是美国针对中国的围堵战略的重要工具。如今美国觉得还不足以遏制中国，还要推动北约+日韩澳新，深化战略同盟一起打败中国。\n\n对此，中国绝不能掉以轻心，务必要做好军事斗争准备，另外一方面可在关键时刻支持俄罗斯阻挡北约，让北约无法集中精力对付中国。",

        "summary": "The article discusses the evolving dynamics of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and its broader geopolitical implications. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has expressed willingness to negotiate with Russia through third-party mediation, a significant shift from his previous stance of refusing talks as long as Vladimir Putin remains in power. This change is attributed to Russia's military advantages in the conflict, particularly in regions like Kharkiv and Donetsk, and the heavy casualties suffered by Ukrainian forces.\n\nMeanwhile, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has accused China of inciting the Russia-Ukraine war and supporting Russia's continued military efforts. This accusation, made without evidence, suggests NATO's broader strategy of countering China after dealing with Russia. Stoltenberg's comments indicate NATO's intention to collaborate with Asia-Pacific countries like Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand to maintain Western dominance and counter China's influence.\n\nThe article concludes by emphasizing the need for China to prepare for potential conflicts with NATO and to support Russia to prevent NATO from focusing solely on China."

On July 1, 2024, Ukrainian officials, including Debt Management Office Director Yuriy Butsa and IMF representative Gavin Gray, held a conference call with creditors, indicating plans to include GDP-linked bonds in the restructuring. Despite the lack of agreement in June, Ukraine aims to finalize the restructuring by August 1, 2024. The proposed plan involves exchanging existing bonds for new sovereign bonds maturing between 2034 and 2040, and state-contingent debt instruments. The IMF has not commented on the meeting. Ukraine's Finance Minister Serhiy Marchenko expects an agreement by August 1. The restructuring proposal includes options for traditional bonds and GDP-linked bonds, with varying interest rates and potential debt reductions based on economic performance."

Chinese media claim this weapon has a maximum range of 400 kilometers and can destroy dense structures. The development of the \"Xia Pao\" is influenced by the Russia-Ukraine war and is seen as preparation for potential future actions to unify China. The China North Industries Group Corporation (Norinco) announced the successful development of this vehicle-mounted howitzer, which has a barrel length of 15 meters. This new artillery piece reflects China's advanced capabilities in large-caliber artillery and provides new tactical options for military operations."

        "body": "欧尔班的新闻负责人哈瓦西 (Bertalan Havasi)向匈牙利国家通讯社MTI证实，欧尔班总理已于上午抵达基辅与乌克兰总统泽连斯基举行会谈。他表示，此次会谈的主要议题是乌克兰在抵抗俄罗斯入侵的同时建立和平的机会。同时两位领导人还将讨论匈牙利与乌克兰的双边关系。\n\n美联社报道指出，基辅官方目前尚未就欧尔班抵达基辅表态。\n\n匈牙利周一刚刚接任欧盟理事会轮值主席国，在乌克兰问题上匈牙利总理欧尔班与其他西方领导人明显不同。在匈乌关系因俄乌战争以来长期紧张背景下，他的此次对乌访问因而也是罕见之举。作为俄罗斯总统普京最亲密的欧盟盟友，欧尔班经常阻挠、拖延欧盟向乌克兰提供援助以及就乌克兰战争制裁莫斯科的努力，这让泽连斯基和其他欧盟领导人感到失望。\n\n今年早些时候，欧尔班否决了欧盟一项500亿欧元的援助乌克兰计划。尽管该计划最终获得批准，但援助的拖延受到乌克兰官员的批评。\n\n欧尔班自 2010年就任匈牙利总理执政至今，作为一个持欧洲怀疑论的领导人，他长期以来一直被欧洲伙伴指责破坏本国民主制度，阻挠破坏欧盟关键政策和优先事项。欧盟因涉嫌违反法治和腐败而冻结了对布达佩斯超过 200 亿美元的资助，而欧尔班则开展了多次反欧盟行动，称欧盟是一个过度集权、压制性的组织。\n\n欧尔班还曾激烈反对任何有关乌克兰加入欧盟的讨论，认为乌克兰尚未做好准备。 在去年 12 月欧盟 27 国领导人峰会上，在就启动乌克兰加入欧盟谈判的关键投票中，欧尔班最终同意离场，使得欧盟 26 国领导人通过对基辅的入盟谈判启动。\n\n周一，乌克兰泽连斯基对匈牙利开始担任欧盟轮值主席国表示 \"祝贺\"。他说，希望匈牙利能促进 \"欧洲共同的价值观、目标和利益\"。\n\n欧尔班一直与俄罗斯及总统普京保持密切关系，而自乌克兰战争爆发以来，西方已经切断了与普京的联系。欧尔班反其道而行，正加强本国与莫斯科的政治与经济联系。俄罗斯仍然是匈牙利能源供应的重要提供国。\n\n在对俄罗斯制裁问题上，欧尔班也持相左立场，反对并试图软化欧洲对俄罗斯的制裁，但并没有完全阻止制裁。他多次将俄罗斯对乌克兰的入侵描述为 \"军事行动\"，这一莫斯科使用的委婉用词。在去年10 月中国举行一带一路高峰会期间，欧尔班还在北京与普京会见，讨论能源合作问题。\n\n相反，他与泽连斯基的关系非常冷淡。法新社报道提到，欧尔班在 2022 年连任后的一次讲话中甚至把乌克兰总统列为自己的 \"对手 \"之一。而泽连斯基也在乌俄战争初期批评欧尔班的对乌立场。但双方还是有过多次会面，特别是 6 月底在布鲁塞尔举行的欧盟峰会期间。去年12 月，两人在阿根廷总统米莱就职典礼上的交流曾经引发关注，从网上的图片显示，双方对话气氛似乎非常紧张，而泽连斯基以 \"坦率 \"来形容此次交流。\n\n此次欧尔班对基辅的访问令外界意外，而据乌克兰官员表示，就两国领导人的会晤经过了数月磋商，两国外交部长今年1月底会谈，为双方领导人的会晤做准备。\n\n实际上，乌克兰与匈牙利的关系自俄罗斯入侵乌克兰之前就已摩擦不断，因为乌克兰自2017年以来采取了一系列有争议的措施引发双方交恶。在克里米亚危机后，基辅为强化民族认同、对抗俄罗斯文化影响，2017年出台法律要求在全国范围将乌克兰语作为学校必修课而引发境内匈牙利少数族裔的不满。在乌克兰最西部的外喀尔巴阡地区有约10 多马扎尔人，他们和匈牙利的主要民族是同一民族。当地在一战之前一直属匈牙利管辖。乌克兰在近期修改了引发争议的教育和语言法案，被视为是为争取匈牙利的支持，此次欧尔班访问基辅之行能否进一步改善双方关系仍需观察。\n\n在乌俄战争爆发后，匈牙利虽然与乌克兰接壤，但其接收的难民人数也远远少于大多数其他欧洲国家。",

        "summary": "Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán visited Kyiv to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky the day after Hungary assumed the rotating presidency of the EU Council. The main topics of discussion were opportunities for peace amid Ukraine's resistance to Russian invasion and bilateral relations between Hungary and Ukraine. Orbán's visit is notable given his close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin and his frequent opposition to EU aid and sanctions against Russia, which has frustrated Zelensky and other EU leaders. Earlier this year, Orbán vetoed a €50 billion EU aid plan for Ukraine, causing delays despite its eventual approval.\n\nOrbán, a Eurosceptic leader since 2010, has been criticized for undermining democracy in Hungary and obstructing EU policies. The EU has frozen over $20 billion in funds to Hungary over rule of law and corruption concerns. Orbán has also opposed discussions on Ukraine joining the EU, although he did not block a key vote on the matter last December.\n\nDespite his close relationship with Russia, Orbán's visit to Kyiv, which followed months of diplomatic preparation, is seen as a rare move. Relations between Hungary and Ukraine have been strained since 2017 due to Ukraine's language laws affecting Hungarian minorities. Ukraine recently amended these laws, possibly to gain Hungary's support. The outcome of Orbán's visit on bilateral relations remains to be seen."

Currently, there are no negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, with significant differences in their conditions for ending the war. Ukraine demands a complete Russian withdrawal from its internationally recognized territories, including Crimea, while Russia wants Ukraine to cede four eastern and southern regions.\n\nRecently, over 90 leaders and officials attended the first Ukraine Peace Summit in Switzerland, where Zelenskyy sought support for Ukraine's negotiation position. Meanwhile, Russian forces have exploited delays in Western military aid to Ukraine, launching large-scale attacks near Kharkiv, though their momentum has waned. Outgoing NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg noted that Russian offensives this year have achieved minimal success and sees no signs of a significant Russian breakthrough.\n\nAdditionally, a Ukrainian drone attack on a Russian village near the border killed five people, including two children, and injured two others.

        "summary": "The article discusses the delicate balancing act of Chinese President Xi Jinping amid pressures from both the West and Russia regarding China's stance on the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Key points include:\n\n1. **Warnings from the West**: On June 18, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg urged China to stop supporting Russia's defense industry, warning of potential consequences if China continues its support.\n\n2. **China's Response**: China maintains that its trade with Russia is normal and not aimed at fueling the conflict. However, there are concerns about China's provision of dual-use technologies that bolster Russia's military capabilities.\n\n3. **Internal and External Pressures**: Xi Jinping faces internal economic challenges and external pressures from both the West and Russia. The West, particularly the U.S. and NATO, threatens economic sanctions, while Russia warns China against aligning too closely with the West.\n\n4. **Recent Developments**: The article mentions the defection of former Russian Deputy Defense Minister Tatyana Shevtsova to France, which could expose details of China's support to Russia. Additionally, trade dynamics between China and Russia have fluctuated, reflecting Beijing's cautious approach to avoid Western sanctions.\n\n5. **Strategic Implications**: The West aims to deter China from supporting Russia to alter the course of the Ukraine war, especially before the upcoming U.S. elections. Meanwhile, Russia seeks to maintain China's support by offering various incentives and warnings.\n\n6. **Potential Outcomes**: The article suggests that the West might use both pressure and incentives to sway China, while Russia continues to leverage its relationships with neighboring countries to influence Beijing.\n\nThe author, Zhang Junhua, is a Chinese-German political scholar, providing a nuanced analysis of the geopolitical tensions and their implications for China."

        "summary": "In a recent development in the Russia-Ukraine war, Ukrainian forces launched a night assault on Russian positions north of Vovchansk, causing significant Russian casualties and leading to a mutiny among the Chechen Akhmat battalion and the 153rd Anti-Tank Artillery Regiment. This occurred on June 29, 2024, as the war entered its 860th day. The mutiny was driven by severe war fatigue and heavy losses among Russian troops, including the elite 83rd Air Assault Brigade.\n\nAdditionally, a high-profile defection has shocked the Russian government: Tatiana Shevtsova, a former Deputy Minister of Defense, fled to France with highly classified information and substantial financial assets. This defection has significant implications, potentially exposing critical Russian military secrets to NATO.\n\nThe situation on the battlefield remains dire for Russian forces, with Ukrainian troops gaining the upper hand through superior firepower and strategic maneuvers. The conflict has seen heavy losses on both sides, with Russian forces increasingly relying on outdated equipment. The defection and battlefield setbacks have further strained the Russian military and political leadership."

        "title": "阜成门六号院｜所有互联网平台都应该永远自觉抵制\"仇恨流量\"",
        "body": "阜成门六号院｜所有互联网平台都应该永远自觉抵制\"仇恨流量\"\n\n无疑，最近七八年全球的舆论生态，可以说是1970年代中期半世纪以来最糟糕的一段时期。在90年代或者21世纪初，人类自己以为制度和技术的进步可以避免非理性极端主义的泛滥，但是我们发现那时候的知识阶层过于自信了。没想到大致以2015年为界，全球范围内，从发达国家到发展中国家，保守主义、反理性主义、极端主义都是愈演愈烈，乃至已经盖过了理性声音。\n\n这个极端主义思潮的变化背后是有复杂的原因的，比如过去三十年的全球化、市场自由主义，在历史上最大规模重塑了人类的利益分配，从而带来国家间、宗教间、民族间、阶级间的新旧利益冲突，以及各自所代表的意识形态间的对峙。当然移动互联网及其创造的商业模式的兴起，从而产生的对社会舆论生态的重塑，也是重大诱因。\n\n在纸媒时代，乃至在PC端互联网时代。我们社会的信息生产权是掌握在职业媒体人以及知识分子手中的，这保证了信息的相对真实性，以及价值的相对温和性、中立性。尽管很多国家会有新闻管制，但是他们的媒体顶多是选择性发布信息，而很少去像自媒体博主那样随意捏造信息，毕竟他们还是要维护一国思想生态之平衡和宣传的信誉度。\n\n那个时候媒体承担的社会角色也比较单一，传媒只承担了社会运转中的一小部分功能，它与生产、商业是相对分离的，尤其是它顶多为商业提供广告服务，而不是商业活动的载体。\n\n但是移动互联网的出现，颠覆了这一切。首先来说，信息生产权从职业媒体人、知识分子转到普罗大众。过去发表文章、表达自己的见解观点，是极少数专业人士的事情，可是今天我们乡下在农田劳动的老舅，街头卖菜的大妈也都当起来博主来。这里有个数据，传统传媒时代，全国大致有电视广播机构2500余家、报纸1700余份、期刊10000余份，不过期刊里面大量是学术杂志，各类新闻媒体加起来不过五六千家，而现在自媒体主体，光活跃的公众号就2400多万，更不用说抖快B还有好几亿更活跃的视频老铁了。\n\n并且那些来自社会基层的博主内容流量远远高于专业博主。这是互联网受众群体的文化结构决定的，也是由人性决定的，人们认知倾向于简单化归因、二元对立、极端化，人们喜欢接受那些听起来很爽、很解气或很愤怒的东西。看北京大学的教授给你一五一十讲俄乌战争、中日关系，哪有听出租车大爷聊时事过瘾？现在就连高级知识分子都被价值之上的谣言小卡片或\"爽文\"屏蔽了信息，更何况普通受众了！\n\n所以，移动互联网的出现，让信息生产去中心化、去建制化，不可否认这具有进步性，普罗大众开始掌握信息话语权和表达权，但是人类很多领域的运转是讲究专业性的，比如政治、经济、医学等，外行取代内行、占据话语中心，最后社会会失序，人类会反受其害。\n\n其次，移动互联网也颠覆了经济运行规则。在移动互联网时代，媒体等于一切，媒体几乎成了我们所有一切经济和社会生活的承载体，生产、消费、社交、金融、物资流通等都高度依赖互联网信息平台，只要你获取了用户群和信息流，就等于掌握了最关键的商业资源。所以，媒体的价值和信息变现的能力，被急剧放大了。\n\n这种商业法则和信息生产模式的改变产生的融合效应就是，一些互联网平台公司为了流量的需求，也就是为了商业变现的目的，利用所谓\"算法规则\"，主动推送那些吸引眼球的，普罗大众\"喜闻乐见\"的劣质化、极端化信息。这些信息笔者分为四类：第一是谣言流量，第二是庸俗搞笑流量，第三是贩卖焦虑流量，第四是仇恨流量。\n\n笔者对短视频生态了解不深，但是根据\"新榜\"对每日公众号上10万＋话题的统计，那些社会和政治话题流量最高的，显然都是那些贩卖仇恨或\"吓尿体\"、\"震惊体\"居多。人们获取的信息越来越取决于算法的投喂，越来越段子化、谣言化、情绪化，所谓\"劣币驱逐良币\"。\n\n以我们对刚刚逝去不久的中国纸媒时代和PC互联网时代的记忆来看，那时候的媒体总体保持的是一种向上求真姿态。那个时代产生了很多优质的电视栏目、报纸、刊物，乃至互联网新闻频道，比如央视的《新闻调查》、《对话》，市场化媒体《财经》、《经济观察报》，腾讯网的《大家》、《今日话题》等等。媒体是一个充满温情、理性、深度思考的地方。\n\n但是我们可以明显感觉到，自从移动互联网普及到人们日常生活后，我们整个社会信息质量迅速下降，社会价值也越来越撕裂，社会情绪越来越暴戾化、对峙化。在国外表现就是特朗普为代表的激进右翼政客的崛起，他们绕过过去\"建制化媒体\"，直接用自媒体进行政治动员；在国内的表现就是大量那些处于边缘角落的低学历、非专业、反理性、反人道的\"言论领袖\"的崛起。\n\n这其中直接危害性最大，最值得警惕的是仇恨流量，虽然仇恨是人类社会中天然存在的一种情绪元素，但任由它发酵，会毁坏一个社会的平衡和繁荣。当然，互联网平台上流行的仇恨，不仅仅包括煽动对外部世界的民族仇恨，还有煽动的对内的各种仇恨，比如：\n\n对某些阶层的仇恨。最典型的是对民营企业家阶层的仇恨，把社会不公平等责任完全归咎为企业家，归咎为企业资本。\n\n地域、民族、宗教仇恨。利用刻板印象，编造信息刻意丑化某一地域人群，进而对其进行各种权利歧视；以及无限放大对一些少数民族和宗教与汉族文化差异性，贴上各种阴谋论标签。\n\n价值观仇恨。主要是对主张法治、权利、自由、平等、开放等价值观的知识分子、媒体、法律阶层的仇恨，不分青红皂白就扣上\"汉奸\"、\"第五纵队\"的帽子（当然很多以\"自由派\"自居的人，也乐于给别人扣\"极左\"、\"义和团\"之类的帽子，进行人格、道德全面否定，不过此类人主张尊重人权、不主张进行人身迫害）。\n\n而仇恨流量的最终结果是诉诸暴力和肉体消灭。近两年涌现出几位知名度很高的自媒体博主，竟然堂而皇之主张处决汉奸（或者主张为了消灭某个假象敌，不惜死个1亿人口），关键\"汉奸\"是一个很弹性模糊的文化词汇，而不是法律词汇，他们可以随意定义你是汉奸，所以就可以汉奸罪处决任何人。这种言论却从来得不到制裁，反而很多人理性讨论一些话题心惊胆战，今天被禁言，明天被删帖。\n\n这种言论以及背后价值流行下去，只能会造成未来一旦经济情况不好，很可能出现流血暴力。所以，笔者又称之为\"人血流量\"。而且这种暴力一定是无序的，会不断发明新的敌人，将攻击范围无限扩大化，每个人都有可能会成为受害者，如果觉得我是危言耸听或胡说八道，建议好好读读20世纪的世界史，你会发现无数个经典素材。\n\n因此，现在网易、腾讯等互联网平台发了公告，给与煽动中日对立、挑动极端民族主义的的博主给予处分，体现了他们的社会担当。如果让说真话的人心惊胆战，让造谣、制造仇恨的人躺着赚钱，那这个舆论场太不正常了，这个社会太没有希望了。\n\n但是笔者觉得这还远远不够，就内容上讲，不仅要严厉制裁那些宣传对外仇恨，还要制裁那些煽动我们中国社会社会内部仇恨对立的。往往一个社会仇外情绪，受制于国际较量，最后很难成气候，伤害不了几个外国人；但是对内部自己人的仇恨，却很可容易造成骇人听闻的悲剧。\n\n我们也希望不仅仅网易、腾讯要行动，其他平台，尤其是视频平台更要有切实的行动，不仅是发个公告而已。毕竟现在信息流中，视频的比重远远大于文字，这方面视频平台的责任更大。\n\n笔者最后要说的是，现在互联网平台规模都很大了，资金实力都很雄厚了，几个大的互联网平台企业都是全球500强或者排名前20的独角兽。这些企业应该学习借鉴一下谷歌、微软此类国际同行，学会靠真正解决人类的难题，创造技术核心竞争力赚钱，而不是无限延续单纯靠流量赚钱的\"粗放\"模式。\n\n如果在这种模式已经显露出巨大社会危险性的时候，依然无动于衷、置身其外，不仅丧失了一个科技企业应有的社会责任，亵渎了科技本身的价值，他们自身最终也会遭到极端主义思潮的反噬。",

        "summary": "The article discusses the deteriorating global public opinion environment over the past seven to eight years, highlighting the rise of conservatism, anti-rationalism, and extremism since around 2015. It attributes this shift to factors such as globalization, market liberalism, and the advent of mobile internet, which decentralized information production from professional media to the general public. This shift has led to a proliferation of low-quality, extreme content driven by algorithms on internet platforms, resulting in the spread of hate, rumors, and anxiety.\n\nThe article emphasizes the significant role of internet platforms in this negative trend, criticizing them for prioritizing traffic and commercial gains over social responsibility. It calls for these platforms to resist promoting \"hate traffic\" and to take stronger actions against content that incites hatred, both externally and internally within societies. The piece praises recent actions by platforms like NetEase and Tencent to penalize content that stirs extreme nationalism but argues that more comprehensive measures are needed.\n\nThe author urges major internet companies to adopt more responsible business models, akin to those of international tech giants like Google and Microsoft, focusing on solving human problems and creating core technological competencies rather than merely chasing traffic. The article warns that failing to address these issues could lead to severe social consequences and ultimately harm the companies themselves."

The visit underscores India's emphasis on its relationship with Russia, a key supplier of military hardware and a major source of crude oil for India, the world's third-largest oil consumer. Discussions between the leaders will cover military logistics cooperation, the potential revival of joint fifth-generation fighter jet development, and nuclear energy collaboration, though no major agreements are expected."

        "summary": "On July 2, 2024, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban arrived in Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. This visit marks Orban's first trip to Ukraine since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war. The primary agenda of their discussion is to explore opportunities for peace between Russia and Ukraine and to discuss bilateral relations. Orban's visit coincides with Hungary's first day as the rotating president of the EU Council, a position that allows Hungary to influence the EU's agenda and priorities. Orban has been a vocal critic of Western military aid to Ukraine, arguing that it exacerbates the conflict. He advocates for peace negotiations and has maintained a close relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The meeting underscores Hungary's unique stance within the EU, emphasizing peace and minimal financial support to Ukraine."

        "title": "北约将向基辅派高级文官 寻求使对乌援助\"不受特朗普影响",
        "body": "据《华尔街日报》报导，美国和北约官员表示，北约将向基辅派驻一名高级文职官员，预计下周在华盛顿举行的峰会上将宣布一系列旨在加强对乌克兰长期支持的新措施。这些措施旨在支持乌克兰最终加入该联盟的前景，而无需向其提供成员资格。采取这些措施的背景是欧洲极右翼政治势力抬头，前总统特朗普重返白宫并减少美国对乌克兰支持的可能性与日俱增。\n\n北约组织还将在德国威斯巴登设立一个新的指挥部，负责协调向乌方提供军事装备和训练乌军人员的工作。这项行动名为\"北约乌克兰安全援助与培训\"，将由来自32国联盟的近700名美国和其他盟国人员组成。该行动将接管自2022年2月俄罗斯全面入侵乌克兰以来一直由美军负责的大部分任务。这些新举措已酝酿数月，但在拜登总统周四与特朗普的电视辩论中表现不佳，以及特朗普抱怨美国在乌克兰问题上花费了大量资金之后，这些拟议中的举措又有了新的紧迫性。\n\n2009年至2013年曾任美国驻北约大使的达尔德（Ivo Daalder）说：\"这一变化的一个重要原因是为了使对乌克兰的援助工作不受特朗普的影响\"。他指出，\"北约将取代华盛顿负责管理培训和援助。因此，即使美国减少或撤回对这项工作的支持，也不会取消这项工作\"。\n\n随着极右翼政党在法国、荷兰和整个欧盟获得越来越多的选民支持，北约作用的制度化也可能使对乌克兰的军事援助不那么容易受到盟国政策波动的影响。曾于2013年至2017年担任美国驻北约大使的卢特（Douglas Lute）说：\"面对潜在的国家政治变化，无论是美国、法国、英国还是欧盟的选举结果，北约的作用都具有持久性\"。\n\n美国现任和前任官员说，这些措施将使北约能够更好地协调西方国家向乌克兰提供军事支持的努力，而这已成为莫斯科和西方国家在北约大门口的一场旷日持久的意志考验。该计划还旨在使乌军更像北约军队。所有盟国领导人都将出席在华盛顿举行的北约峰会，会上将重点讨论支持乌克兰的倡议，75年前北约的创始条约就是在华盛顿签署的。该条约的目的是保护其成员国免受来自莫斯科的威胁 -- -- 北约正再次承担起这一使命。\n\n北约外交官说，尽管条款仍在谈判中，但联盟成员希望华盛顿峰会还能就每年向乌克兰提供军事支持的财政承诺达成一致。联盟成员最近的讨论包括设定每年大约400亿美元的目标，并增加许多盟国的捐款额，但美国可能仍将是主要对乌捐助国。\n\n许多盟国表示，北约应邀请乌克兰加入，启动一个可能需要数年时间的进程，但美国和德国反对在下周的峰会上采取这一步骤。官员们说，为了掩盖北约内部的分歧，联盟很可能将乌克兰加入北约的申请说成是\"不可逆转的\"，而去年北约维尔纽斯峰会公报中的措辞是\"乌克兰的未来在北约\"，2008年峰会的公报则称乌克兰总有一天会成为北约成员国。\n\n根据已商定并将在华盛顿峰会上最终批准的倡议，来自非美国成员的工作人员将在新的北约威斯巴登指挥部与美国人并肩工作，根据乌方的需求调整军事装备捐赠并协调交付。他们还将协调对乌军的培训工作，以确保所提供的装备符合基辅的需求。\n\n官员们说，北约工作人员本身不会进行任何培训。这些转变旨在建立机构动力，并传播从数十个国家向乌克兰边境输送物资所涉及的琐碎后勤知识。北约秘书长斯托尔滕贝格（Jens Stoltenberg）上月曾在布鲁塞尔表示，这些变化将使北约对乌克兰的支持\"在未来数年内有更坚实的基础\"。\n\n虽然这一变化将扩大北约的参与，但美国将继续提供大部分人员，这些人员将向美国欧洲司令部司令兼任北约欧洲盟军最高司令卡沃利（Christopher Cavoli）报告。驻基辅的北约高级文职官员将重点关注乌克兰的长期军事现代化需求和非军事支持，并与计划中的威斯巴登指挥部和北约布鲁塞尔总部建立联系。新措施还标志着北约态势的重要转变。联盟最初与乌克兰的军事行动保持距离，以避免被指责为冲突的一方。组织结构的变化意味着北约现在准备在帮助基辅抗击俄罗斯入侵方面发挥更重要的作用。\n\n美国国务院一位高级官员说：\"由于北约盟国向乌克兰提供的安全援助占援助总额的90%以上，北约自然是协调援助以确保乌克兰现在和将来更有能力保卫自己的地方\"。华盛顿峰会正值美国政坛的关键时刻。拜登把他在动员北约支持乌克兰方面发挥的作用作为其任内外交政策的主要成就之一，白宫一直在寻求帮助乌方抵御俄军的进攻，同时限制冲突升级为美俄直接冲突的风险。拜登还表示，阻止乌克兰境内的俄军对阻止莫斯科在欧洲其他地区甚至更远地区的侵略至关重要。\n\n拜登在上周四的电视辩论中说：\"我得到了世界上其他50个国家对乌克兰的支持，包括日本和韩国。（历史证明）欧洲发生的任何一场大规模战争都无法仅局限于欧洲境内\"。特朗普则称乌总统泽连斯基（Volodymyr Zelenskyy）是\"有史以来最伟大的推销员\"，因为他说服了美国向基辅提供巨额军事支持，并称俄乌战争对欧洲国家来说比对美国来说是一个更大的安全问题，\"因为我们中间有一片海洋\"。\n\n特朗普还宣称要在宣誓就任总统前，就泽连斯基与俄总统普京之间的外交协议进行谈判。特朗普没有解释这种和解的条件是什么，但他说，普京要求莫斯科保留乌克兰东部被占领的4个州，同时乌方放弃加入北约的申请，这是不可接受的。特朗普称：\"在我于1月20日就任总统之前，我将解决普京和泽连斯基之间的战争\"。",

This initiative, named \"NATO-Ukraine Security Assistance and Training,\" involves nearly 700 personnel from 32 countries and aims to ensure long-term support for Ukraine without granting it NATO membership. The measures are designed to mitigate potential reductions in U.S. support under a possible Trump administration and to stabilize aid amidst rising far-right political influence in Europe.\n\nThe new command center will take over many tasks previously managed by the U.S. military since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The initiative seeks to institutionalize NATO's role, making military aid less susceptible to political changes in member countries. The upcoming NATO summit in Washington will discuss these plans, with a focus on financial commitments and the long-term integration of Ukraine into NATO structures.\n\nFormer U.S. NATO ambassadors Ivo Daalder and Douglas Lute emphasized the importance of these changes in maintaining consistent support for Ukraine. The summit coincides with a critical moment in U.S. politics, as President Biden highlights his role in mobilizing NATO support for Ukraine, while former President Trump criticizes the extent of U.S. involvement and proposes negotiating a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia."

        "body": "俄乌战争第860天（2024年7月2日），先来看看乌克兰对克里米亚的袭击。\n\n7月1日，乌军导弹袭击克里米亚塞瓦斯托波尔，俄军称击落所有导弹，但俄军后勤基地疑似被击中，损失仍在澄清。\n\n乌军还袭击俄罗斯别尔哥罗德、库尔斯克、沃罗涅日三个地区，导致这些地区大范围停电，只能说，俄罗斯人将习惯战争带来的代价。\n\n俄军过去四天向别尔哥罗德投掷9枚炸弹和枚导弹，过去一年至少投掷38枚炸弹自己炸自己。\n\n由于俄军飞机担心被乌军击落，远距离投掷准星太差，多次将炸弹投掷到自己领土，这就有点过分。\n\n7月1日，俄军用伊斯坎德尔导弹袭击乌克兰米尔戈罗德空军基地，根据视频显示，至少摧毁1架Su-27飞机，损坏其他几架飞机。\n\n俄军宣布摧毁乌军F-16战机，显然是宣传过猛，被击中的飞机不是F-16，只是Su-27，也没有发生大爆炸。\n\n如果为正常的飞机都是加满航空燃料随时准备起飞的，更多信息显示这些飞机可能为无法飞行的Su-27备件，已经停在机场很久，而且没有任何伪装和防空。\n\n乌克兰空军官员尤里·伊格纳特（很久前就不是乌克兰空军发言人）称乌军遭遇一些损失，但不是俄罗斯声称的损失。\n\n乌军将无防护Su-27战机露天放置在伊斯坎德尔导弹射程内，更像是迷惑和消耗俄军导弹。\n\n既然是战争，俄乌互相攻击就会有损失，俄军的无人机技术在最近半年大幅度提升，值得乌克兰警惕。\n\nF-16 战机配合爱国者防空系统如何发挥最大效果，值得关注。\n\n来看看战场最新消息，哈尔科夫地区，俄军似乎在这里中陷阱，乌军正消耗俄军。\n\n乌军使用高精度炸弹、各种火炮、无人机猛烈打击俄军，俄军不得不抽调部队继续向这里增援。\n\n乌军向哈尔科夫派遣数万人，人数明显多过俄军，却没有猛攻，目的显然不是反击，而是消耗俄军。\n\n仅乌军第三突击旅就宣布过去一周杀死500名俄军士兵，更不要说其他部队的战果。\n\n哈尔科夫战役成为俄军鸡肋，也成为一个新的转折点，很多趋势从五月开始变了。\n\n俄军突击小组进入乌克兰苏梅地区试图制造新的热点，直接被乌军发射JDAM炸弹摧毁集结点。\n\n这足以说明，俄军哈尔科夫已经失败，在苏梅挑衅也不会有好结果。\n\n阿夫迪夫卡地区，俄军继续向西攻击，试图拉平新奥列克桑德里夫卡-索基尔沿线，但进展有限。\n\n巴赫穆特地区，俄军继续从多个方向攻击恰西夫亚尔，甚至使用TOS发射燃烧弹实施\"焦土\"战术，但未能取得有效进展。\n\n马林卡-新海利夫卡地区、扎波罗热地区，俄军继续攻击，损失惨重。\n\n赫尔松地区，乌军用导弹袭击赫尔松地区左岸新卡霍夫卡的俄军基地，发生数次爆炸后发生强烈火灾，俄军损失未知。\n\n库皮扬斯克-克雷明纳-莱曼地区，乌军继续向克雷明纳实施反击，俄军在多个方向攻击没有进展。\n\n武莱达尔方向，俄军士兵驾驶摩托车攻击乌军阵地，以掩盖缺乏重装备的事实，但大多数都是自杀式攻击，损失惨重。\n\nBMP-1炮塔的火炮、BTR 70装甲运兵车、T-62坦克、摩托车、滑板车，高尔夫球车被用作俄军进攻、运输工具，让人不得不怀疑俄军的资源还能维持多久。\n\n7月2日，乌克兰公布俄军损失数据，俄军人员每天过千损失，累计损失超过54.5万人， 已不是小数字。\n\n7月2日，匈牙利总理欧尔班访问基辅，担任欧盟轮值主席国之后，欧尔班出访首站。\n\n过去两年多不少欧洲国家领导人到访基辅，这是欧尔班首次访问基辅。\n\n从匈牙利最近的表现来看，欧尔班很会看风向，这是一个明显的信号。\n\n欧盟主席冯德莱恩、欧洲委员会秘书长贝尔塞、欧盟外交政策负责人卡拉斯、北约秘书长吕特，加上不少欧洲国家最近都转向支持乌克兰，只能说，欧洲共识之下，欧尔班很会做出选择。\n\n随着欧洲国家愈发强硬，俄罗斯未来占不到什么便宜，代价将很高。\n\n7月1日，土耳其、保加利亚和罗马尼亚已开始在黑海开展扫雷行动，在黑海搜寻水雷，以提高乌克兰粮食运输船的航行安全。\n\n土耳其站在哪一边已经很清晰，土耳其30多年未能加入欧盟，而乌克兰欧盟谈判已经启动。\n\n芬兰议会批准开放15个军事基地供美军使用，美军真的到了俄罗斯家门口。\n\n7月1日，荷兰宣布颁发出口许可证，乌克兰\"很快\"将获得24架荷兰F-16战机中的首批。\n\n美国众议院民主党人敦促五角大楼扩大对乌克兰 F-16飞行员的培训。\n\n美国国务卿布林肯表示，在不久的将来，甚至可能在下周北约峰会之前，乌克兰就应该会收到关于加强防空的新声明。\n\n北约将向乌克兰派遣常驻高级官员确保对乌克兰的武器供应在任何情况下都不会停止，即使特朗普赢得美国大选、右翼势力赢得欧洲大选。\n\n7月2日，在荷兰举行的援助乌克兰爱国者防空系统进行调试，出现的ACSV G5防空版雷达，这意味着交付过程将非常快。\n\n荷兰组装的爱国者防空系统将很快抵达乌克兰，北约峰会之后，乌克兰防空力量将大大增强。\n\n泽连斯基接受采访时提到可以通过第三方以类似黑海粮食协议的模式谈判，实际上是变相拒绝很多国家的劝和。\n\n在战争上分出胜负之前不可能有谈判，很多人认为乌克兰要认输是误读，乌克兰不想与普京谈判，也不会用领土做交易。\n\n更何况乌克兰状况比两年前好很多，现在认输，不符合逻辑和认知。\n\n波兰总理图斯克强调，乌克兰经受住了俄罗斯的攻击，乌克兰迟早会赢得这场战争。\n\n认为乌克兰将赢得胜利的人越来越多，乌克兰将克服一切挑战，赢得最终胜利。",

Since the end of 2023, these events have forced commercial ships on the Asia-Europe route to alter their paths, increasing travel time by about 30%, and significantly raising both logistics costs and carbon emissions. Additionally, shipping companies have increased vessel speeds to meet schedules, consuming more fuel and further escalating emissions. After three years of pandemic-induced disruptions, companies had planned to reduce logistics costs and carbon emissions this year, but the geopolitical situation has caused these metrics to exceed planned figures, putting substantial pressure on businesses."

The summit, held from July 3-4, will focus on economic and energy issues, as well as the Russia-Ukraine war and other geopolitical matters. The SCO, founded by China and Russia in 2001, includes Central Asian countries, India, Iran, and Pakistan.\n\nXi's visit highlights China's ongoing efforts to strengthen ties with Kazakhstan and other Central Asian nations through initiatives like the Belt and Road. The visit also raises questions about potential meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin, especially given the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and international sanctions against China and Russia. Experts suggest that if Xi and Putin meet, they will likely discuss cooperation and responses to Western sanctions.\n\nAdditionally, Xi plans to visit Tajikistan, where China has promised significant investments in infrastructure projects. Putin is also expected to attend the summit and hold bilateral meetings, potentially including one with Xi."

His unit, equipped with transport vehicles, armored cars, drones, and anti-tank missiles, exemplifies this transformation. The U.S. has supported Ukraine with Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and Javelin anti-tank missiles, enhancing their combat effectiveness through real-time information from NATO's surveillance systems. This has allowed Ukraine to effectively counter Russian air and ground forces. The conflict has forced the Russian military to adapt by using forest and urban warfare tactics. Strategically, the UK-supplied Storm Shadow missiles and U.S.-supplied HIMARS have inflicted significant damage on Russian assets. The U.S. is reportedly considering similar strategies for Taiwan, which warrants close attention. Notably, Russian General Surovikin has shown adaptability in response to these challenges."

        "body": "刚被普京处理完，俄军高层\"女一号\"，卷走几十亿美元叛逃西方？\n\n刚被普京处理完，俄军高层\"女一号\"，卷走几十亿美元叛逃西方？俄军\"女一号\"是谁？她是如何叛逃的，又为什么要逃？\n\n近日，俄罗斯国内流传出一则令人震惊的消息，作为俄军\"女一号\"的俄罗斯原国防部副部长塔季扬娜·舍夫佐娃大将，疑似在6月中旬被解职后秘密叛逃至西方。毫无疑问，若此消息属实，舍夫佐娃将成为俄乌战争爆发以来，俄方叛逃的最高级别官员。\n\n据外媒报道，舍夫佐娃在离职后，除了携带大量现金独自一人乘飞机前往法国外，还通过虚拟货币向境外转移数十亿美元资产。更加离谱的是，在此期间没有受到任何部门阻拦。目前，这一消息尚未得到俄罗斯官方证实，且舍夫佐娃与其他俄方官员均未出面辟谣。\n\n可以想象，一旦这一消息被\"实锤\"，必定引发俄罗斯政坛动荡。要知道，舍夫佐娃才刚刚被普京处理完，从国防部副部长的位置上被解职，转眼间便叛逃到西方，这无疑是对普京本人和国家的严重挑衅。\n\n在这一消息传出后，有分析人士指出，舍夫佐娃的叛逃，可能与普京政府近期的反腐行动有关。据悉，舍夫佐娃自2010年起担任俄国防部副部长，负责俄军资金管理事务长达14年之久，她的上位很可能与俄罗斯前防长谢尔久科夫有关。而在任职期间，她与绍伊古的关系也很密切。更有甚者，俄罗斯国内早就有传言称，舍夫佐娃夫妇拥有巨额不明财产，可能涉及腐败案件。\n\n在此情况下，如果舍夫佐娃确实叛逃西方，其后果将不堪设想。首先，她的叛逃很可能引发俄罗斯官场\"大清洗\"。一方面，她的轻松出境叛逃存在重要疑点。试想一下，如果她在俄罗斯国内外都受到高度关注，却能够带着一大箱子现金成功出境，那么这背后可能涉及到一些更加复杂的东西。比如说，有没有境外势力协助？在俄罗斯政坛内存不存在同伙？无论是哪一个都将引发普京的怒火。\n\n另一方面，她的叛逃还可能导致俄军内部重要情报泄露，舍夫佐娃作为国防部高层，对俄军的军备采购、资金调用及作战目标等情况了如指掌。如果她向西方情报部门提供这些信息，势必将对前线的俄军构成严重威胁。除此之外，她的叛逃还将对俄罗斯士气造成沉重打击，并可能引发更多高层人员叛逃的\"连锁反应\"。\n\n事实上，舍夫佐娃的叛逃传言，再次凸显了俄罗斯结构性腐败问题的严重性。在俄乌战争持续的背景下，普京政府需要尽快采取有效措施，解决这一问题，确保国家的长治久安。否则一旦任由恶劣影响蔓延开来，最终很可能导致俄罗斯政治局势的总崩盘。\n\n值得注意的是，舍夫佐娃叛逃到法国之后将会面临的情况，也成为关注和猜测的重点。关于西方会不会没收舍夫佐娃的财产？也存在多种可能性。如果西方没收其财产，那么会不会让其他想要叛逃的俄罗斯官员不敢叛逃？如果西方不没收其财产，那么将会给出怎样的理由？除此之外，还存在一些情况，比如西方国家并不知道舍夫佐娃的具体行踪和财产情况；或者说他们即使知道，也可能因为各种原因而选择不采取行动。\n\n当然，这些都只是基于\"舍夫佐娃叛逃\"消息被证实的情况下的分析。在俄罗斯官方和舍夫佐娃本人未给出回应之前，我们需要保持理性和客观，等待更多确凿的证据出现。同时，我们也应该从俄方的教训中吸取经验，认清结构性腐败可能导致的危害。对于这种可能存在的\"窝案\"\"要案\"，我们也需要从根本上加以杜绝。",

        "summary": "A recent shocking rumor in Russia suggests that Tatyana Shevtsova, the former Deputy Minister of Defense, has defected to the West after being dismissed in mid-June. If true, she would be the highest-ranking official to defect since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war. Reports indicate she fled to France with large sums of cash and transferred billions via cryptocurrency without any hindrance. This has not been confirmed by Russian authorities, and neither Shevtsova nor other officials have denied it.\n\nAnalysts speculate her defection might be linked to recent anti-corruption efforts by Putin's government. Shevtsova, who managed military funds for 14 years, allegedly has ties to former Defense Minister Serdyukov and current Minister Shoigu, and there are rumors of her possessing unexplained wealth.\n\nIf confirmed, her defection could lead to significant political turmoil in Russia, including a potential purge within the government and military. Her knowledge of military operations and finances poses a severe security risk if shared with Western intelligence. Additionally, this could demoralize Russian forces and trigger further defections.\n\nThe situation underscores the deep-rooted corruption in Russia, which the government must address to maintain stability. The West's response to Shevtsova's defection, particularly regarding her assets, remains uncertain and could influence future defections. However, until official confirmation, these remain speculative analyses."

        "body": "普京想给胡塞导弹，沙特搅局，小王子不愿俄罗斯介入加沙战争\n\n木叔这篇国际评论，来分析俄罗斯对加沙战争的介入。\n\n7月1日，中东媒体引述一名美国官员的话说，俄罗斯不久前推动给也门胡塞武装更多军火，作为对抗西方给乌克兰售武的一种报复措施。但是被沙特给阻止了。\n\n普京考虑向胡塞武装分子提供反舰巡航导弹，这种导弹飞行高度更低、更难被探测和拦截，非常适合攻击船只等特定目标。目前胡塞的武器库中有巡航导弹，但是伊朗提供的。如果俄罗斯给胡塞这种导弹，肯定在红海攻击货轮的效果会更好。\n\n不过美国情报部门称，沙特王储小萨勒曼很不高兴，公开进行了干预，阻止俄罗斯的这个动作。\n\n小萨勒曼在普京几个月前访问沙特时与之谈论此事，要求俄罗斯不要寻求这一安排。普京随后表示，与沙特已经就消除地区紧张局势达成共识。\n\n也多亏了沙特，目前还没看到俄罗斯给胡塞输送军火，也避免了加沙战争进一步扩大化。\n\n在我看来，从这件事上能看出加沙战争的两个动向。\n\n第一，加沙战争并不是孤立存在的，它与俄乌战争和全球其他地区的冲突和博弈密切相关。\n\n一些人认为俄罗斯专注于俄乌战场，没能力在其他地方与西方对抗，这个想法很天真。不只是在巴以冲突上，就是在朝鲜半岛局势上，都能看出这个俄罗斯和西方对抗的线索。\n\n因而俄罗斯试图给胡塞更好的武器，既是加沙战争外溢效应之一，也是俄罗斯在全球与西方博弈的战略布局。\n\n第二，沙特不想看到俄罗斯介入加沙战争。\n\n尽管沙特和俄罗斯关系也不错，但沙特毕竟不愿意看到伊朗的小伙伴胡塞武装在自己家门口做大。所以在这个问题上，基本没有商量的余地，肯定反对俄罗斯武装胡塞。\n\n同时这也符合沙特和美国关系更密切，以及与以色列关系走近的现实。俄罗斯很难改变。特别是加沙战争结束后，沙特与西方和以色列关系改善可能会加速，这是俄罗斯不愿看到的，因而给胡塞提供武器也等于在阻止这个进程，沙特能高兴吗？",

        "body": "因为众所周知的原因，和大家分别半个月了。只能感叹一句：说人话、说实话太难了。\n\n这段时间\"俄乌战争\"前线没啥好说的明显进展，局座感觉：交战双方都在拖时间，有可能打不动了，也有可能是在憋什么大招。\n\n网上一个小道消息火了：前国防部长绍伊古的副手，俄国防部副部长舍夫佐娃\"叛逃\"了。\n\n克宫对于舍夫佐娃的潜逃并未正式回应，但外界却传来了新任俄罗斯防长别洛乌索夫的愤怒反应。\n\n舍夫佐娃和普京、梅德韦杰夫一样，出身于\"圣彼得堡帮\"。从收税员做起，2004年担任俄罗斯税务局副局长，2010年开始担任国防部副部长，2012年被授予大将军衔，当年年仅41岁。\n\n舍夫佐娃是全球自有现代军衔制度以来，军衔最高的女性，还拥有俄\"国家最高顾问\"的头衔。\n\n据福布斯富豪榜的情报：在俄国防部多年，舍夫佐娃未雨绸缪，在国外购买了昂贵的公寓、土地和豪华汽车，据传此次叛逃到俄罗斯的敌对国 -- -- 法国巴黎。\n\n严格地说，舍夫佐娃并不是普京亲信。\n\n6月17日，普京下令解职4名国防部的副防长后，取代舍夫佐娃职位的，是普京的亲侄女齐维列娃，这位才是亲信。\n\n顺便说一下，齐维列娃的丈夫是俄罗斯现任能源部部长，她自己则掌管着一家大型煤炭公司。\n\n能源、煤炭，这是俄罗斯最大的经济命脉。这说明啥？\n\n说明虽然普京靠\"反对金融寡头\"获得了大量的赞誉，但目前俄罗斯的体制，国家资源依旧掌握在少数人手里，和过去没啥两样。\n\n再来说说\"叛逃传言\"背后的猜测。\n\n能影响俄罗斯国防部的，不过一二人而已，除了普京就是梅德韦杰夫。\n\n2010年，正是时任俄总统梅德韦杰夫，将舍夫佐娃任命为俄罗斯国防部副部长，近十四年掌管俄国防部的财政大权，\"俄乌战争\"爆发后，还负责对伤亡士兵的抚恤善后工作。\n\n说到这，正式谈谈局座个人的看法。\n\n1、俄军腐败程度令人发指。说实话，俄罗斯的腐败之深大家都有耳闻。俄国防部这次系统性腐败，几个副部长被一锅端，下面的各级干部肯定牵连无数。\n\n战争期间还敢大发\"国难财\"，和平时期肯定也是大大的偷油耗子。\n\n2、背后牵连很大。俄国防系统腐败案后，舍夫佐娃应该处于被严密监视控制的状态。那她怎么逃走的呢？应该是她背后的实权大人物，悄悄地帮了她，当然也是帮了自己。\n\n这里插一句，局座发现最近\"大嘴\"梅德韦杰夫没怎么发声了。难道是泥菩萨过江？想想有这么可能，当年他的儿子在美国过着奢靡的生活，这些钱怎么来的？\n\n3、对世界影响不少。舍夫佐娃这次是精心准备。网传是她转走的是价值10亿美元的加密货币，这是有可能的，因为她的职务就是\"财务总监\"，对这些复杂的流程太熟悉了，而且都在她的权限范围内。\n\n如果一切属实，后果是严重的。因为舍夫佐娃对俄军事机密了如指掌，包括俄罗斯背后的支持者、军民两用产品的隐秘采购路径、俄伊两国合作的细节、经费等核心要事，很多是上不了台面的。",

        "body": "台湾省出了个\"诸葛亮\"，军事才能顶呱呱，绿媒：台湾\"有救\"了\n\n台湾是中国不可分割的一部分，理应回归祖国的怀抱，实现祖国的统一，完成两岸人民的夙愿。\n\n然而，有一些\"台独\"分子却一直热衷于抹黑大陆，离间两岸的关系，妄想将台湾从中国的版图中分离出去，其中更是有一位典型的代表，让台湾绿媒称之为\"军事奇才\"，直呼台湾有救了。\n\n这位台湾\"诸葛亮\"究竟是谁呢？他做了什么才获得绿媒如此高的评价，他真的拥有\"拯救台湾\"的能力吗?\n\n加入国民党，支持两岸统一\n\n台湾绿媒所追捧的\"台湾诸葛亮\"，其真实姓名叫于北辰。\n\n于北辰在1968年出生于台北，但事实上他的祖籍在山东，他爷爷那一代是国民党，当年解放战争爆发后，国民党军队节节败退，以蒋介石为首的国民党残存势力逃到了台湾，他爷爷就是其中跟随的一员。\n\n年少时的于北辰拥有远大志向，充满了抱负，他的梦想就是成为一名军人，统领军队，掌管大权，为台湾的军事安全做出贡献。\n\n为了实现梦想，于北辰倾尽全力考入了台湾陆军军官学校，这是所久负盛名的军事学校，它的前身正是由孙中山一手创办的黄埔军校。\n\n1924年，孙中山在苏联和中国共产党的帮助下，在黄埔建立了陆军军官学校，后经改组成为了中央军事政治学校。黄埔军校以革命精神为指导，为当时的革命培养了不少人才，意义重大。\n\n从台湾陆军军官学校毕业以后，于北辰跟随爷爷加入了国民党，曾担任台湾陆军装甲兵542担任参谋长，最高官职为少将，也算是在军事领域取得了一番成就。\n\n在两岸关系的问题上，于北辰最初是强烈支持两岸统一的，这其中有两方面原因。\n\n第一，于北辰的祖籍在山东，是从爷爷那一辈开始才移居台湾的。从某种意义来讲，于北辰真正的故乡在大陆，而台湾仅仅是漂泊的他乡，所以于北辰对大陆具有一定的思念之情。\n\n第二，国民党早期的主张还是以支持两岸统一为主，严谨地说，至少他们对外界是这样宣传的，就连参加2024年大选的国民党候选人侯友宜，近期也频繁呼吁实现两岸的统一。\n\n因为上述两点原因，于北辰早期一直坚持促进两岸统一的观点。\n\n马英九时任台湾地区领导人，以及国民党主席，看中了当时能力突出的于北辰，而随着职位的提升，他掌握的权力也进一步增大，在军中也有了更多的话语权，同时在公众视野里也有了更多的曝光度。\n\n2017年，在接受公众媒体采访的时候，于北辰坚定地表示，两岸统一是历史发展趋势，他强烈支持台湾早日回归祖国的怀抱。\n\n于北辰身居要职，在台湾具有一定的影响力。在两岸关系紧张的时候，于北辰身为高官，坚定支持两岸统一，这得到了大陆人民的认可，于北辰随之进一步向大陆扩大影响力。\n\n于北辰频繁地出现在大陆的公众场合，参加了不少公众节目，并始终高调宣传和平统一的言论，让他收获了不少大陆粉丝，不少大陆人民都对他寄予厚望。\n\n后来，为了进一步扩大影响力，于北辰甚至聘请了专业的团队，建立了自己的YouTube账号，频繁发表和平统一的言论，又让他增加了不少海内外的粉丝群体。\n\n就当人们以为，于北辰会成为下一个支持两岸统一的代表性人物时，他却突然退出了国民党，态度也发生了巨大转变。\n\n因多种原因，退出国民党\n\n在退出国民党前，于北辰先选择了退役。\n\n于北辰选择退役的理由非常奇葩，他对外宣称自己的身体已经无法承担军队高强度的工作，他的心率已经下降到每分钟39次。\n\n从于北辰找的借口来看，就可以发现他的愚昧无知，成年人正常的心率水平在60~100次/分，倘若心率下降到39次/分，估计于北辰甚至都没有找借口退役的机会，直接住在医院了。\n\n于北辰的做法也从侧面反映了台湾军队的脆弱，台湾军队素来有\"草莓军队\"的笑称，就是因为他们的士兵接受不了高强度的训练，没有彰显军人的刚强。\n\n连于北辰这样的高级军官尚且如此，台湾军队的普通士兵又会好到哪里去呢？\n\n退役之后，于北辰凭借在军队的影响力，以及积累的人脉，谋得一个十分清闲的职务，他担任了黄国园党部的主任委员，这份工作薪资高，任务轻，地位高，深得于北辰满意。\n\n然而，政策的变化击破了于北辰安享余生的梦想。\n\n蔡英文担任台湾领导人期间，为了增加建设台湾的资金，蔡英文选择了\"节流\"的方式，军队薪资正是她重点削减的领域之一。\n\n于北辰对于蔡英文的政策十分不满，他好不容易才拼上了少将的职位，然后凭借前少将的身份谋得清闲又多金的工作，他多年的努力就因为一纸政策而白费了。\n\n或许是出于对蔡英文的不满，也或许是想要赚取更多的钱，于北辰从此开始了一系列\"骚操作\"。\n\n众所周知，台湾分为绿媒和蓝媒两大媒体。其中，绿媒是支持台独的一方，蓝媒则是支持统一的一方。\n\n因为于北辰先前支持两岸统一的言论，所以外界自然将他划分为蓝媒的阵营。削减军队薪资的政策出台后，于北辰便频繁接受绿媒的采访，参加绿媒阵营的访谈节目。\n\n当人们以为，\"蓝营\"的于北辰是想要在公众场合反驳\"绿营\"，谁知他却一改支持统一的言论，故意抹黑国民党，抹黑大陆，绿媒也十分喜欢邀请他，因为他\"蓝营\"的身份更加有说服力。\n\n就这样，于北辰在抹黑国民党、阻碍两岸统一的路上越走越远，国民党对于于北辰的做法十分不满，党的内部产生了众多舆论和纠纷，于北辰自知在国民党无法发展，便选择了退出国民党。\n\n退出国民党后，于北辰当了一段时间的无党派人士。在此期间，于北辰凭借\"前蓝营\"的身份，以及在YouTube积累的粉丝群体，继续频繁参加绿媒节目，逐渐转化为绿媒阵营。\n\n民进党一直以来都阻挠两岸统一，属于绿媒阵营。民进党看中了于北辰的影响力，便邀请他入党发展，于北辰也是欣然接受。\n\n加入民进党，愈发猖狂\n\n此前，虽然于北辰也在发表不利于两岸统一的言论，但并没有十分猖狂。\n\n身处国民党的时候，于北辰虽然对国民党不满，但毕竟需要忌惮一整个政党的实力，所以稍有收敛；作为无党派人士的时候，尽管没了政党的压力，但背后也缺乏势力撑腰，所以于北辰也没有太过放肆。\n\n但加入民进党以后就不一样了。民进党本身就属于绿媒阵营，一直以来都阻挠两岸统一，这和于北辰站在同一战线。\n\n其次，民进党有一个名为\"愚民政策\"的舆论战政策，主要内容就是向台湾民众传递大陆错误的信息，抹黑大陆，弱化大陆，让台湾民众有战胜大陆的信心，从而鼓动更多的台独分子。\n\n于北辰可谓是\"愚民政策\"的忠实践行者，他可是闹了不少造谣大陆的笑话。\n\n第一，著名的\"210%拦截率\"言论。\n\n于北辰在参加一档政治论坛节目时，被主持人问起\"天弓导弹的防空拦截率\"，于北辰丝毫不惧泄露台湾的军事机密，毫不遮掩地回答说：\"70%\"。\n\n但更令人震惊的还在后面，于北辰告诉台湾民众不必恐慌，因为大陆的导弹绝对无法抵达台湾，既然一枚导弹的拦截率是70%，那么三枚导弹的拦截率就是210%，就等同于绝对拦截。\n\n于北辰的言论让两岸人民都很无语。台湾人民指责他为什么要泄露军事机密，大陆人民则嘲笑他身为少将，却不懂基本的数学计算，闹出这样的笑话，可笑至极。\n\n第二，\"土房子\"事件\n\n同样是在参加政治节目的时候，于北辰就大陆的建设程度发表了自己的看法，他认为大陆的经济发展已经停滞，人们住的都是土房子，人们住在里面甚至还有被压死的可能。\n\n不得不说，于北辰真是把\"愚民政策\"贯彻到底，他不仅想要愚弄民众，甚至把自己都变傻了，中国大陆的发达程度全球皆知，台湾民众不是傻子，只是于北辰将他们当作傻子。\n\n于北辰的搞笑、愚蠢言论数不胜数，大陆人民往往看笑话，但这次的事件却也引起了台湾人民的愤怒。\n\n传递虚假消息的确是舆论战的有效方式，但舆论战的对象从来都是对外，用虚假信息迷惑敌人，而于北辰却是用虚假信息迷惑自己人，这让台湾民众感到非常不满。\n\n第三，挑战中国事件\n\n在俄乌战争发生的时候，于北辰迅速抓住了热点事件，他告诉台湾民众，乌克兰的军事实力仅仅在22位，就敢于挑战俄国，台湾的军事实力排在21位，挑战中国那不是轻轻松松。\n\n不得不说，一般人真的难以理解于北辰的思想，军事实力的比拼不能用数字来简单衡量，每一名都有着不小的差距，更何况中国掌握着核技术，台湾想要在军事上胜过大陆简直是天方夜谭。\n\n于北辰不仅对台湾的军事力量很自信，还对自己的实力很自信，他狂妄宣称，大陆上的任何一名军队将领和他单挑，他都会赢得彻彻底底，很难想象这是一个声称心率只有39/分，早早退役的无用少将。\n\n事实上，于北辰闹出的笑话还有很多，比如声称大陆的航母要48小时才能启动，大陆军队无法抵达台湾；还有让中国把疫苗交给日本，再让日本交给台湾，只有这样台湾人民才会接受......\n\n结语\n\n从强烈支持两岸统一的爱国人士，到故意抹黑中国、阻挠两岸统一的台独分子，于北辰生动诠释了什么叫虚伪，什么是贪图利益。\n\n尽管于北辰坚定贯彻\"愚民政策\"，但从效果来看，最终变得愚笨的只有他自己，他自己沦为了两岸人民的笑话，稍有理智的人就不会被他的花言巧语所欺骗。\n\n台湾绿媒就别逞强了，于北辰究竟是不是\"诸葛亮\"，两岸人民心知肚明。两岸统一是历史发展的大趋势，任何人都不可能阻止，违背历史潮流的人终将被时代淘汰，中国终会实现统一。",

        "summary": "The article discusses a Taiwanese military figure, Yu Beichen, who was once a strong advocate for the unification of Taiwan and mainland China but later shifted his stance to support Taiwanese independence. Born in Taipei in 1968 with ancestral roots in Shandong, Yu initially joined the Kuomintang (KMT) and rose to the rank of Major General in the Taiwanese army. He was known for his pro-unification views and had significant influence in Taiwan.\n\nHowever, Yu's stance changed due to dissatisfaction with policies under Taiwanese leader Tsai Ing-wen, particularly regarding military salaries. He began appearing on pro-independence media, criticizing the KMT and mainland China, and eventually joined the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which opposes unification.\n\nYu's statements, such as claiming a 210% missile interception rate and describing mainland China as economically backward, have been widely ridiculed. His shift from a unification advocate to a pro-independence figure has made him a controversial and divisive character in Taiwanese politics. The article concludes by asserting that the unification of Taiwan and mainland China is an inevitable historical trend."

        "body": "美国总统拜登在首场选举辩论电视直播上表现失常，引发美国舆论和民主党内的激烈议论。拜登在辩论时显得口齿不清，偶尔甚至不知所云，让很多人怀疑年岁已大的他已有老人失智症状。许多民主党支持者和中间选民对此大感震惊，觉得拜登不适合继续执政四年，党内外要求他以大局为重退选的呼声陆续出现。但距离11月的总统大选投票日时间不多，阵前换将不仅兵家大忌，民主党还得面对众多党内选举程序和法律的障碍。非但民主党如今深陷政治危机，世界各国恐怕也对白宫主人的神志健全感到狐疑不定。\n\n白宫关于81岁拜登的认知健康状况，此前一直讳莫如深。在社交媒体上，拜登在辩论前的众多国内外不同场合，都出现过答非所问甚至不知所措的呆滞镜头。78岁的对手特朗普因而反复发出挑战，要求拜登接受体检。但白宫和主流媒体一再指责对手恶意中伤，强调拜登神志敏锐。辩论会直播却赤裸裸地让美国选民见证他年老体衰，反应迟钝的事实。辩论后最新公布的民调显示，72%选民认为拜登缺乏足够认知能力肩负总统重任，对民主党无疑是沉重一击，全党一时陷入群龙无首的危机状态。\n\n亲民主党的左派媒体如《纽约时报》等，已经用社论的高规格公开要求拜登退选。社媒上许多小道消息也盛传党内出现逼宫声浪。但一来民主党如今台面上缺乏众望所归的替代人选，几名被点名的州长潜在人选都不愿意表态，副总统哈里斯则不得人心；二来拜登已经取得党内初选资格，临时换将会面对众多党内民主和法律程序的障碍，难度不小。此外，对拜登影响最大的第一夫人吉尔，至今仍拒绝让拜登退选，党内大老如前总统奥巴马等还在公开支持拜登，增加党内换将的困难。\n\n在民主党之外，美国舆论最大的争议是，拜登所表现的认知健康问题，到底被隐瞒了多久？当下在幕后真正治理美国的三军统帅到底是谁？美国的民主是否出现问责空白？这就隐约涉及政治责任和伦理的宪政问题了。拜登的心智健康还牵扯出另一个关键疑问：美国民主机制的自我修复能力。乐观派时常提醒，万勿怀疑美国政治强大的纠错能力。但白宫主人的心智健康，加上目前角逐总统大位的两人均属高龄，美国政治\"蜀中无大将\"的窘境，是今年美国选民再无法回避的挑战。\n\n美国民主政治品质的堕落，也在这场电视辩论里暴露无遗。拜登与特朗普在辩论全程丝毫没有展现君子风度，辩论前后没有握手，也不正眼看对手，一副不共戴天的态势；而且辩论缺乏实质政策交锋，多次使用粗言鄙语，望之不似人君。特朗普不改夸夸其谈，自吹自擂的作风。拜登在辩论后也被有线电视新闻网（CNN）查证有不少不实之词，就差没指他撒谎，包括宣称任内没有任何美军丧命。共和党籍众议院议长约翰逊为此召开记者会，逐一念出因拜登仓皇撤离阿富汗时牺牲的13名美国士兵的名字。\n\n总统选举电视辩论的另一个直接后果，是极大地提高了特朗普二进宫的概率。CNN的即时民调发现，67%受访者认为特朗普更适合担任总统，比辩论前的55%增加12个百分点；只有33%认为拜登适任。左倾民调机构\"为进步之数据\"调查发现，八成美国人观看或阅读辩论报道，62%认为特朗普胜出，关键是有高达68%的中间选民这么认为。这意味着特朗普第二任期的可能性越来越大，美国的国内外政策或将发生重大改变。美国的盟友和对手因而都必须做好相应准备，国际局势也因此难免发生重大变化。\n\n作为世界头号强国，美国总统的认知健康无疑影响深远，特别是方兴未艾的俄乌战争、以哈冲突，乃至极可能爆发的以色列 -- 真主党战争，以及南中国海危机，都可能因为各方对美国总统健康的判断而出现新变数和动能，如不能排除个别势力或认为这场美国政治危机机不可失，决定铤而走险，导致更大的地缘政治动荡。因此，美国民主党的政治危机，对外牵动深广。华盛顿责无旁贷，必须尽快稳定人心，把各方误判的风险降到最低。",

        "summary": "**Summary:**\n\nThe Democratic Party in the United States is facing a political crisis following President Joe Biden's poor performance in a televised election debate. Biden, aged 81, appeared confused and incoherent, raising concerns about his cognitive health. This has led to calls from within the party and among voters for him to withdraw from the presidential race. However, replacing him poses significant procedural and legal challenges, and there is no clear alternative candidate. The debate has also increased the likelihood of former President Donald Trump winning a second term, as polls show a significant shift in voter preference towards him. This situation has broader implications for U.S. domestic and foreign policy, potentially affecting international relations and ongoing conflicts. The crisis underscores concerns about the accountability and self-correcting mechanisms of American democracy."

        "summary": "**Summary:**\n\nOn June 30, the first round of France's National Assembly elections concluded, revealing a significant political shift. The far-right National Rally (RN) led with 33% of the votes, followed by the left-wing New People's Ecological and Social Union (NUPES) with 28.5%, and President Macron's centrist Renaissance party with 22%. This unexpected outcome has left Macron disheartened, as he had dissolved the parliament to regain control but instead faced a major defeat.\n\nThe RN's potential to secure 260-310 seats in the 577-seat assembly could lead to a significant power shift, possibly making RN the dominant force and potentially placing their 28-year-old leader, Jordan Bardella, as a prime ministerial candidate. This rise of the far-right in France is seen as a trend that could spread across Europe, with implications for EU politics, including a potential shift towards more autonomous European policies and a reevaluation of relations with Russia and the US.\n\nFor China, this political shift in Europe could present new opportunities for deeper economic and diplomatic engagement, as far-right parties may adopt more pragmatic and independent foreign policies."

        "title": "不接电话就是出事了！美防长紧急与俄防长通话，俄军已吃过三次亏_手机网易网",
        "body": "6月25日，乌克兰战争打到了第853天。70万俄军在上千公里的战线上激战之际，俄罗斯新防长别洛乌索夫应邀和美国防长奥斯汀打了一个电话。应邀也就是说，这个电话是美国方面发起的，主动者是美国。于是问题就来了：美国防长为什么要主动打这个电话呢？\n\n首先，这是证明给美国民众看，美国本土是安全的，别担心。华盛顿与莫斯科之间军事热线电话的存在，一直是两大军事强国相安无事的标志。然而，俄乌战争开始之前和俄乌战争开始最初的那段时间里，美国防长根本打不通俄防长的电话，也就是说，俄防长根本不接美防长的电话。和战斗的民族针锋相对近80年的五角大楼非常明白，莫斯科现在的黎明若总是静悄悄，那俄军肯定是在作妖。要知道\"不可预知性\"向来是俄军的软实力之一。\n\n二十多年前，俄罗斯积贫积弱之际，200人的俄空降部队就敢远程奔袭7000北约部队重重包围的科索沃机场。现在俄罗斯战车已经启动两年多了，70万俄军已经在乌克兰打红了眼，什么事干不出来。毕竟俄军是最讲究不在沉默中爆发，就在沉默中灭亡的。\n\n所以一直在背后操纵乌克兰战争的白宫，一直被俄罗斯人深深痛恨的五角大楼，必须要给美国人一个\"定心丸\"：俄军现在正面战场打得很顺，还有心情和五角大楼保持热线联系，说些不疼不痒的片汤话。这意味着俄美关系暂时是稳定且可控的，战争只发生在欧洲，不会威胁到美国本土。或者换句话更直白地表示，现在俄军还没有被逼疯，还在和美军讨价还价，还不会乱扔\"大炮仗\"。美国本土现在是安全的。\n\n其次，这是证明给北约中的欧洲各成员国看，俄罗斯对常规战争还心存侥幸，你们继续放手折腾俄军就是了。俄罗斯独自在乌克兰挑战常规力量数倍于自己的北约和美国开打代理人战争，底气自然是其三位一体的战略核力量\"大炮仗\"。一旦要么战争结束，要么毁天灭地。\n\n然而俄罗斯打俄乌战争是为了活下去，并不是不想活了，所以能通过常规手段解决的问题就不要用最极端的手段了。能用常规手段逼美国和北约退回1997，不用动用\"大杀器\"，莫斯科也是何乐而不为的。\n\n所以现在俄军故意拉长战线，在上千公里的战线上对乌军有生力量\"千刀万剐\"，有留地不留人的因素考虑，但也有演练俄罗斯铁血一代杀乌克兰敬欧洲诸国的意思。\n\n现在俄罗斯已有200多万经过乌克兰战火洗礼的铁血战士，欧洲各国想要继续群殴俄罗斯就要考虑和这200多万老战士玩命的代价。因此乌克兰战事越打规模越大，烈度越打越高之际，俄军也越打越凶，眼越打越红，欧洲各国心中的小鼓也就会越敲越响。\n\n所以北约峰会马上要开了，要给下一步的作战套路定性之际，美国防长出面套一套俄罗斯新防长的底牌，给北约跟欧洲成员国吃\"定心丸\"的意思就非常明显了。因为只要俄新防长接电话，那就意味着俄罗斯还理美国，还不想直接攻击美国本土。只要俄罗斯不攻击美国本土，欧洲各国就没有挨\"大炮仗\"的威胁，继续鼓励乌克兰和俄罗斯人拼人头就是了。\n\n最后，这是证明给乌军看，美军对俄军还是有威慑力的，乌军尽管放手打就是了。俄乌战争爆发之后，俄美两国防长共通了三次电话，每次电话之后乌军接受的军援力度都会加大，俄军所承受的损失就越大。\n\n2022年5月13日，美防长奥斯汀邀请俄防长绍伊古进行了俄乌战争爆发后的首次电话交流。当时从基辅撤军后的俄军正面战场推进顺利，不仅拿下了马里乌波尔，而且正在准备推进\"北顿涅茨克-利西昌斯克\"战役。然而双方的电话会谈结束之后，北约立即加大军援乌克兰力度，\"海马斯\"火箭炮一个月后正式在乌克兰战场亮相。乌军渐次从战争的蒙圈期走出，开始对俄军的远程打击彻底改变了乌克兰战场上的态势，打乱了俄军速战速决的计划，乌克兰战事开始呈现胶着状态，双方开展持久性的消耗战。\n\n2022年10月21日，乌军秋季突然发动的大反攻在哈尔科夫方向取得明显效果之后，俄军换帅，苏洛维金将军稳住俄军的阵脚，而且俄罗斯30万老兵的部分动员以及乌东四州入俄公投也顺利完成。美防长奥斯汀邀请俄防长绍伊古进行了俄乌冲突以来的第二次通话，再次探得俄军的底牌之后，20天之内乌军夺回赫尔松。一个多月后的12月5日，乌军第一次袭击俄部署战略轰炸机的恩格斯机场，拉开了俄本土被乌军规模性远程袭击的大幕。\n\n2023年3月15日，\"瓦格纳\"部队在巴赫穆特所打的\"绞肉机\"之战进行到关键时刻，美防长奥斯汀邀请俄防长绍伊古进行了俄乌冲突以来的第三次通话，名义上是讨论美军\"死神\"无人机在黑海被俄军战机击落一事，实际上仍然是稳定俄军躁动的心，劝俄罗斯安心地在乌克兰战场上挨打。结果三个月后，乌军不仅发动了筹谋已久的夏季大反攻，而且美国也开始批准射程超300公里的陆军战术导弹系统入乌作战。\n\n乌克兰战事越来越凸显双方拼人头比狠的特点。现在北约峰会召开在即，北约在今年下半年的对俄作战调子将定下来，乌军为了获得更多的北约军援，不仅在筹谋在哈尔科夫边境大反攻威胁俄罗斯本土的安全，甚至为了给F-16战机入乌参战，乌军加大了用美国导弹火箭弹对克里米亚和俄罗斯本土的远程攻击，以至于克里米亚的海滩都成为了乌军的攻击点。这种疯狂绝对是俄军难以接受的。\n\n因此，应当是为了让俄军的报复保持在可控范围之内，美国防长再次邀通了俄防长的电话。相信听到电话中传来俄防长别洛乌索夫声音的那一刻，美防长悬着的心就放了下来。别洛乌索夫说了些什么已经不重要，只要他拿起了电话，就说明现在的俄军还没有决定要在沉默中爆发。",

This call, initiated by the U.S., aimed to reassure American citizens of their safety and demonstrate that U.S.-Russia military communication lines remain open, indicating stable and controlled relations. The call also served to reassure NATO and European countries that Russia is still engaging in conventional warfare and not resorting to extreme measures, thus encouraging continued support for Ukraine.\n\nHistorically, such calls have led to increased military aid to Ukraine and significant Russian losses. For instance, after a call in May 2022, Ukraine received advanced weaponry, altering the war's dynamics. Another call in October 2022 preceded Ukraine's recapture of Kherson and attacks on Russian territory. A third call in March 2023 coincided with Ukraine's summer counteroffensive and the approval of long-range missile systems.\n\nAs the NATO summit approaches, the U.S. aims to gauge Russia's stance and ensure the conflict remains contained. The call's primary significance lies in the fact that Russia's defense minister answered, indicating that Russia is not yet escalating the conflict to a direct attack on U.S. soil."

        "body": "700000名大军压境，普京终于动真格了，乌军战败进入倒计时！\n\n俄乌战争已经持续了近3年时间，对全球局势造成了严重影响，外界都在观望，什么时候能够战争结束，而近日俄罗斯总统普京的表态，直接让所有人都看到，想要战争结束，唯一的可能就是将乌克兰彻底打服！普京表示，乌克兰永远不要幻想俄罗斯撤军，因为这是永远不会发生的事情！现在俄罗斯70万大军压境乌克兰，战争结束的条件只有一个，就是俄罗斯彻底将乌克兰打败！看来这场战争还要持续很长时间！\n\n据俄罗斯媒体报道称就在前不久，普京对越南进行了访问，在离开越南之前，普京召开了一次新闻发布会，在此次发布会上态度明确地表示，俄罗斯不会撤军！乌克兰政府之所以要求俄罗斯撤军，也并非是想要战争结束，只不过是拖延战术，想要拖延时间而已！普京强调，俄罗斯方一直愿意就俄乌冲突问题进行谈判，但乌克兰一直在破坏谈判进程，导致双方至今为止没有任何的谈判成果！\n\n而且在此次讲话中，普京还重点提到了核武器的问题，其表示，随着现在西方国家逐渐降低核武器的使用门槛，俄罗斯也必须要做出相应的调整，俄罗斯正在考虑改变现有的核原则！不过普京也强调，俄罗斯率先使用额核武器没有任何意义，至少在现在的情况来看，是没有什么意义的！\n\n毕竟对于俄罗斯来说，现在已经掌控了战场局势，70万俄军士兵在前线，大军压境乌克兰，在这种情况下，乌克兰基本上没有什么反抗的能力，局势对俄罗斯是非常有利的，如果乌克兰不能够按照俄罗斯所说的条件停火止战，进行后续的谈判，那么俄罗斯并不介意继续对乌克兰进行轰炸，反正已经打了近3年，俄罗斯也不介意继续打一段时间，彻底把乌克兰打服！\n\n就算西方国家要介入其中，俄罗斯也无所畏惧，如果整个北约都参与到战争中去的话，俄罗斯的额核武器也有了用武之地！现在俄罗斯铁了心要和乌克兰打到底，泽连斯基面临的压力前所未有！俄罗斯突破的关键节点，对乌克兰来说就是致命打击要来临的时刻！不知道乌克兰是否做好准备了！眼看着俄罗斯的态度越来越强硬，以美国为首的西方国家也越来越慌了！",

        "summary": "The article discusses the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, which has lasted nearly three years and significantly impacted global affairs. Recently, Russian President Vladimir Putin made a firm statement that Russia will not withdraw its troops from Ukraine, emphasizing that the only way to end the war is for Ukraine to be completely defeated. Putin's comments came during a press conference in Vietnam, where he accused Ukraine of using delay tactics and disrupting peace negotiations.\n\nPutin also addressed the issue of nuclear weapons, noting that Russia might adjust its nuclear policies in response to the West lowering the threshold for their use. However, he clarified that Russia sees no current benefit in using nuclear weapons first.\n\nWith 700,000 Russian troops positioned at the Ukrainian border, Putin believes Russia has the upper hand and is prepared to continue the conflict until Ukraine surrenders. He also indicated that Russia is not intimidated by potential Western or NATO intervention, suggesting that such involvement could justify the use of Russia's nuclear arsenal. The article concludes by highlighting the increasing pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the growing concern among Western nations led by the United States."

        "body": "中国官方日前证实，习近平将出访中亚并参加上合组织峰会。习近平此行是否会与俄罗斯总统普京再度会面，引发外界关注。\n\n中国外交部6月30日宣布，中国国家主席习近平将于7月2日至6日，出席在哈萨克斯坦首都阿斯塔纳举行的上海合作组织（上合组织）成员国元首理事会第24次会议。习近平还应哈萨克斯坦总统托卡耶夫和塔吉克斯坦总统拉赫蒙的邀请，将对两国进行国事访问。\n\n中国外交部发言人毛宁在7月1日的例行记者会上介绍说，此次峰会后，中国将接任上合组织2024至2025年轮值主席国。她说：\"中方相信，本次峰会将凝聚各方更多共识，谱写合作崭新篇章，为促进各国安全稳定和发展振兴、推动构建人类命运共同体作出积极贡献。\"\n\n上合组织作为一个政治和安全组织，由中国和俄罗斯于2001年发起，成员国包括哈萨克斯坦等中亚五国，及印度、伊朗、巴基斯坦。本次峰会将于7月3日至4日举行，预计重点讨论经济和能源问题，同时涉及俄乌战争和其他地缘政治问题。\n\n自由欧洲电台（RFE）指出，北京自2022年初俄乌战争爆发以来，持续加深与莫斯科的合作，习近平更与普京达成\"无上限\"伙伴关系，以对抗西方。哈萨克斯坦在俄乌战争爆发时虽是俄罗斯最大的贸易伙伴，但延续的战争和国际社会的反应，也给试图保持中立的阿斯塔纳外交、社会和经济带来了额外挑战。此外，华盛顿智库大西洋理事会的一份报告也指出，中国正在尝试向其他国家传播其威权模式。\n\n本月早些时候，哈萨克斯坦一名反对派活动家和记者在乌克兰被枪击，引发外界对哈萨克斯坦威权趋势和镇压异议的担忧。\n\n报道还指出，中国和塔吉克斯坦在5月承诺加强双边合作。中国已承诺向该国中亚的一些最贫困地区投入数十亿美元用于大型项目，包括中国-吉尔吉斯斯坦-乌兹别克斯坦（CKU）公路。中国公司还承诺，在塔吉克斯坦与阿富汗边境建造大型太阳能电站。\n\n另据俄罗斯卫星通讯社报道，俄方证实，俄罗斯总统普京也将于7月3日-4日参加此次峰会，并计划与成员国和受邀国领导人举行一系列双边会晤。不久前结束平壤访问的普京是否会借此与习近平再度会面，引起舆论关注。",

She stated that the more the People's Republic of China tries to \"suppress\" Taiwan's internal freedom and \"sovereignty,\" the more it pushes Taiwan away. Hsiao emphasized that mutual prosperity between the \"two countries\" is preferable, but mainland China must accept Taiwan's current status and existence.\n\nHsiao also mentioned that the Russia-Ukraine war has taught Taiwan and its allies the importance of establishing defensive measures and diplomatic understandings to prevent actions similar to those taken by the Kremlin in 2022. She suggested that Taiwan's defenses should be strong enough to make China reconsider any aggressive actions daily.\n\nThe article criticizes Hsiao's statements, comparing her to another pro-independence figure, Bi-khim Hsiao, and argues that Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has worsened cross-strait relations by not acknowledging the 1992 Consensus and promoting anti-China policies. The article asserts that unification is inevitable and that Taiwan's pro-independence actions will not succeed, especially with new punitive regulations in place."

India has ordered five S-400 systems, with three already delivered and deployed in various strategic locations. The remaining two have been delayed due to the Russia-Ukraine war. In response to the threat from Pakistan's Northern Air Command, India redeployed the S-400 system from Gwalior to Adampur.\n\nIn reaction to India's aggressive actions, Pakistani sources revealed that Pakistan is considering deploying the indigenous FATAH-2 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) to counter the S-400 deployment at Adampur. The FATAH-2 MLRS, similar to the American GMLRS, has a range of up to 450 kilometers, capable of covering the Adampur base. The system was showcased at the IDEF-2023 exhibition in Turkey, with FATAH-1 having a range of 140 kilometers and FATAH-2 designed for 170 kilometers. The FATAH MLRS is believed to be an improved version of the Chinese A-100 MLRS, first publicly displayed in January 2021."

旅居澳洲著名法学家、时常披露中共高层动向内幕的袁红冰教授，就中共最近对外发布的惩治所谓\"台独顽固分子\"《意见》，以及中共高调对外宣布开除连续两任国防部长魏凤和及李尚福的党籍军籍、并移送军事法庭审判的事件，日前向看中国记者独家爆料了这其中的相关内幕。\n\n中共出台关于惩治台独顽固分子的二十二条司法《意见》背景\n\n据悉，针对中共出台的惩治所谓\"台独顽固分子\"的《意见》，有外界评论认为，其严厉程度超过《国安法》，可以说是针对台湾的《国安法》。袁红冰对此首先指出：\"首先我们要看一下这份所谓司法《意见》它出台的背景。在2024年6月21日，也就是在台湾的国民党和白党两党立法院的党团，利用多数暴力强行通过毁宪乱政的国会五法之际，中共的国台办就召开了紧急会议。就是在这个会议上，中共最高法院、最高检察院和公安部、国安部、司法部等联合宣布所谓两院三部关于惩治台独顽固分子的二十二条司法《意见》。从这个时间的点上我们就可以看出，中共和台湾的蓝白两党沆瀣一气，隔岸呼应，内外勾连，制造台湾宪政混乱的这个阴谋，其实是已经昭然若揭。\"\n\n习近平为组长的中共中央对台工作领导小组发送三份名单征求意见\n\n袁红冰在采访中披露了日前中共红二代中反对习近平个人独裁的良知人士，冒着巨大风险传出的信息。\"在上述中共二十二条司法《意见》公布的第二天，也就是星期六的休息日，以习近平为组长的中共中央对台工作领导小组，就把三份名单送交到统战部、中宣部和中共国台办及其所属的各相关的政策研究机构来征求意见。在这三份征求意见名单的说明中特别指出，审查确定这三份名单是为了配合台湾岛内爱国统一力量在台湾立法机构也就是台湾立法院、以及在台湾的媒体舆论界打开突破性的新局面。\n\n这三份名单一份叫做准备新增加的台独顽固分子名单，一份是优先实施缺席审判的台独顽固分子名单，还有一份就是中共认为应当重点保护的台湾内部的人员名单。\n\n在第一份名单中，也就是新增加台独顽固分子的名单中，由中共中央对台工作领导小组指令中共国台办负责来拟定。在这份名单中已经初步确定了将要新确定的台独顽固分子名单主要集中在台湾的立法委员中，包括沈伯洋、吴思瑶、林楚茵。另外在这个名单中还着重征求意见，就是否应当把这个台独顽固分子的名单扩大到县市议员和非公职人员。在这个征求意见的名单中，包括桃园市的议员于北辰，还有台北市的议员简舒培、苗博雅。非公职人员中准备要新确定的这个台独顽固分子，排名在最前面的是两个人，一个就是曹兴诚，一个是王义川。在这份文件中还特别征求如果宣布赖清德是台独顽固分子、对中共统战和国际政治影响的厉害得失的意见，也就是把赖清德也列为台独顽固分子，对中共是否有利。这是第一份名单。\n\n第二份名单是第一批将要实施缺席审判的所谓台独顽固分子。中共在这份文件中着重指出，第一批实施的对台独顽固分子的缺席审判的目的，要聚焦在配合统战工作在台湾立法机构也就是立法院撕开的突破口，要有利于进一步扩大战果，力争能够更加有效的落实习近平总书记关于给民进党执政当局戴上无形的手铐和脚镣的指示。这份名单初步确定的第一批缺席审判的人员，有民进党总召柯建铭，另外新增加的台独顽固分子的名单如果得到确认之后，其中的民进党的立法委员沈伯洋、吴思瑶，还有两位没有公职的人士曹兴诚和王义川。这份文件还特别就一个问题来征求意见，就是对一些身处敏感政治地位的人员进行缺席审判是否对中共暴政有利？这些人员包括台湾的领导人，也就是台湾总统赖清德，还有用中共的话叫副领导人，实际上就是台湾的副总统萧美琴，国防部长顾立雄，国家安全委员会理事长吴钊燮，原来的立法院院长游锡堃，和原来的行政院院长苏贞昌等人。\n\n在这份中共中央对台工作领导小组下发到相关单位的文件中的第三份名单题目很长，叫做'运用惩治台独顽固分子司法意见的相关条例予以重点保护的台湾爱国统一人士的名单'。也就是要通过打击那些所谓的台独顽固分子，要达到重点保护某些人的目的。那么在这个名单中，有台湾的马英九，现在的立法院院长韩国瑜，国民党立法院总召傅崐萁，立委徐巧芯，马文君，高金素梅，洪孟楷等人。这份中共要着重保护的名单中，还包括学者和名嘴邱毅，郭正亮，赖岳谦，郑又平，游梓翔，介文汲，帅化明等总计30余名。\n\n凡是了解台湾情况的人都可以明白，中共想要重点保护的这些所谓的爱国统一人士，其实就是中共在台湾的在地协力者。据中共红二代中的良知人士通报，上述三份名单都是由台湾内部的中共协力者，通过特定人士直接送达中共国台办的。这足以说明台湾人民当前与投共卖台的台奸之间，在立法院和台湾的媒体舆论界进行的冲突，已经不是正常民主规则下的不同意见的合理的发布和合理的竞争。以马英九、韩国瑜、傅崐萁等人为代表的蓝营内部的投共卖台的台奸，乃是中共占领台湾立法院的先头部队。它的目的就是要借着无理的扩张立法权，来破坏台湾的民主法制，阻碍行政权的正常行使和运作。以赖岳谦、郭正亮、介文汲、游梓翔等为代表的投共卖台的台奸名嘴，则是中共占领自由台湾媒体和舆论阵地的登陆部队。他们进行认知作战的目的，就是在台湾内部散布恐共媚共的氛围，瓦解台湾军民保家卫国的战志。\"\n\n中共惩治所谓台独顽固分子的二十二条司法《意见》要达到的目的\n\n据外媒报道，北京方面强调将惩治\"台独顽固分子\"，\"不管身在何处都将一追到底\"。有外界评论，中国法院对台湾没有管辖权，所以并不清楚中国会如何在境外执行任何所谓\"惩治\"。袁红冰对此指出：\"只要去过台湾的人大家都会知道，相当长一段时间以来，中共利用自由台湾的言论自由、新闻自由、媒体自由的这个背景，充当中共中央大外宣和大内宣的喉舌，已经达到了极其猖狂的这个程度。台湾的有一些地方，比如说在傅昆萁家族长期掌权的这个花莲，在大街上你甚至能看到中国共产党的那个血旗。说明中共对台湾岛内的这种统战渗透，已经达到了极其危险的程度。\n\n而中共这次发布这个惩治所谓台独顽固分子的二十二条司法《意见》，它的最重要的目的之一就是从心理上为投共卖台的台奸撑腰打气。这是它的第一个目的。第二个目的，中共现在企图通过这样的一种宣布来表明他们的法律，已经可以适用于台湾。也就是根本无视一个基本的事实，就是中华民国台湾是独立于中共暴政的一个政治实体。它想要从国际社会的视线中抹去这样一个事实。这是它要达到的第二个目的。那它要想要达到第三个目的，就是它为最终军事入侵台湾之后，来清剿它们心目中的所谓台独顽固势力，预先做好司法准备。你看它这个二十二条意见，用台湾的一些评论的话叫做'包山包海'。在台湾的所有的社会的正常生活正常表达的意见，几乎都成为中共认定台独顽固分子的罪行。所以中共一旦军事入侵台湾取得成功之后，它就会依据这个专制恶法，对台湾社会进行大规模的血腥的镇压。这就是中共现在颁布这个二十二条司法《意见》所要达到的三个基本目的。\n\n我们大家都知道，中共暴政的所谓法律是专制恶法，这个法律存在本身就是一种罪恶。其实在法律的理论上早就有一种观念叫做'恶法非法'。面对专制恶法的时候，人们不仅没有服从的这个义务，而且有权利推翻专制恶法。所以如何推翻中共暴政的专制恶法，使中国人民变成自由人，拉开中国民主的历史大幕，这是14亿中国人现在急需要思考并付之于行动的重大的命运问题。\n\n那么，现在中共暴政不仅用它的专制恶法剥夺了、扼杀了14亿中国人的所有属于自由人的权利，它现在还想把它们的专制恶法扩展到世界各地，扩展到自由的台湾。所以说台湾最大的国家危险，来自中共吞并台湾的野心。但是台湾最紧急的国家安全隐患，则是来自台湾内部的这种各类各色的台奸。因此针对中共的所谓惩治台独顽固分子的二十二条司法《意见》，自由台湾急需制定惩治卖国台奸的特别法案，以清除自由台湾国家安全的心腹之患。中共暴政对自由台湾现在的威胁，可以说已经是如黑云压城了。\"\n\n中共红二代披露：习近平要拿李尚福人头祭旗？\n\n据悉，就在中共公布惩治台独顽固分子二十二条司法《意见》、声称要对台独顽固分子判处死刑还不到一个星期，中共又公开对外公布了对两任国防部长魏凤和、李尚福的惩处公告。对此袁红冰引述了中共红二代良知人士的通报、进一步披露了魏凤和、李尚福被整肃的实质罪名。\"有关惩处李尚福的公告，除了贪污腐败这一类风流罪名之外，实质上他的两项最致命的罪名，一个是中共所谓的严重违反政治纪律，一个也是中共所公布的就是严重违反组织纪律。\n\n李尚福的所谓严重违反政治纪律的罪名，在军队内部传达的时候，他的具体罪行指的就是，李尚福支持原国防大学政委刘亚洲上将的观点，暗中反对习主席和中央军委所确定的解决台湾问题的基本战略，大肆散布台海战争一旦爆发，我（共）军可能遭受前所未有的损失，甚至颠覆性损失等一系列祸乱军心、动摇战志的言论。李尚福的所谓严重违反组织纪律的罪名，在军队内部在传达的过程中，他的相关的具体的罪行是李尚福的个人政治野心膨胀，利用职权在军工系统内以及跨军兵种的范围内，肆无忌惮的拉帮结派、培植个人势力。以上的两项所谓的罪行，才是李尚福受到整肃的真正的政治原因。\n\n据中共红二代良知人士通报，习近平在中央军委关于李尚福问题的报告上的批示是这样写的：反党乱军、罪大恶极，应当处以极刑。据此，中共军内的人士认为，习近平必定会拿李尚福的人头来祭旗，从而开判处上将死刑而且立即执行的先例，以震慑军心。另一个前国防部长魏凤和，是李尚福的同谋犯，也是从犯，也将被判处死刑，缓期2年执行。\n\n我们从习近平狂妄的宣称要判处台独顽固分子死刑，到现在我们得到的信息，李尚福将被习近平判处死刑立即执行就可以看到，这两个表面上看来似乎互不相关的事件连接在一起的就是习近平的谋台战略。国际社会应该充分的认识到，习近平独裁统治之下，中共的基本国策，已经由邓、江时期的以经济建设为中心，转变成以共产极权主义全球扩张为中心，同时在搞乱台湾内部的前提下，中共的党卫军将军事入侵台湾。这个则是习近平极权主义全球扩张基本国策的核心而紧迫的战略想定。\n\n刚才我们已经讲了，习近平担任组长的这个中共中央台湾工作领导小组，在下发的那三份这个文件中，其实已经明确的指出中共下一段的全部的统战台湾的工作、统战台湾的活动，包括对台湾的渗透活动，都要围绕着配合台湾蓝白两党在立法院发起的这次这个事实上的登陆战进行。所以，如果还指望中共暴政能够维护台海和平的现状，那么这种指望本身就是一种愚蠢。所以包括美国在内的国际社会现在急需明确的认清，中共暴政一定要破坏台海的和平现状，中共暴政一定会发动台海战争，实现它的企图征服自由台湾的这个战略图谋。国际社会应当做的就是如何做好万全的准备，来反制中共的这种共产极权扩张的战略阴谋。\"\n\n北韩出兵乌克兰与中共图谋台湾\n\n袁红冰最后还分析指出，就最近媒体曝出的北韩出兵乌克兰其实也与中共谋台有着直接的关联。\"中共为了实现它的发动台海战争、吞并自由台湾的这个基本战略，它已经进行了全球的布局。重要一环就是要支持俄罗斯在俄乌战争中继续打下去。整个世界都看得很明白嘛，如果没有中共暴政的全方位的支持，俄罗斯根本不可能抵挡得住国际社会对它如此严峻的经济制裁。所以现在中共的所有的这个对外关系中的一个重要的核心内容，就是绝不允许俄罗斯在战场上失败。\n\n我们以前已经多次说过，无论是北韩向俄罗斯输送的这个军事装备，还是伊朗向俄罗斯输送的无人机技术，它背后实际上都是得到了中共暴政全方位的支持。那么这一次北韩派兵进入乌克兰，虽然表面上称作是什么工程部队，实际上就是一种变相的志愿军或者说变相的雇佣军，来补充俄罗斯在战场上的人员伤亡。那么中共支援北韩这样做的目的，就是为了把美国和欧洲的精力牵制在欧洲，使中共暴政一旦发起台海战争的时候，美国和欧洲无力顾及东亚地区，从而削弱美国和欧洲干预台海战争的意志和能力。\"\n\n(文章仅代表作者个人立场和观点)\n\n记者\"李静汝\n\n来源:看中国

This move coincides with internal political maneuvers in Taiwan and suggests collusion between the CCP and certain Taiwanese political factions.\n\nKey points include:\n1. **Judicial Opinion**: The CCP's 22-point judicial opinion aims to punish \"Taiwan independence\" activists, with implications for Taiwan's political and media landscape.\n2. **Three Lists**: The CCP has circulated three lists for internal review: new \"Taiwan independence\" activists, those to be tried in absentia, and individuals to be protected for their pro-unification stance.\n3. **High-Profile Targets**: The lists include prominent Taiwanese politicians and public figures, with discussions on whether to include Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te.\n4. **Punishment of Defense Ministers**: Former Chinese Defense Ministers Wei Fenghe and Li Shangfu have been expelled from the party and military, with Li facing potential execution for political dissent and corruption.\n5. **Strategic Implications**: The CCP's actions are part of a broader strategy to destabilize Taiwan and prepare for potential military action, with international ramifications.\n\nThe article underscores the CCP's aggressive stance towards Taiwan and the internal and external political dynamics at play."

        "summary": "The article discusses recent developments involving the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and its actions against Taiwan independence advocates. Key points include:\n\n1. **Judicial Opinions on Taiwan Independence**: The CCP issued 22 judicial opinions targeting Taiwan independence advocates, which are seen as more severe than the National Security Law. This move coincided with political turmoil in Taiwan's legislature.\n\n2. **Leadership and Lists**: Xi Jinping, leading the CCP's Taiwan Affairs Work Group, sought opinions on three lists: new Taiwan independence advocates, those to be tried in absentia, and individuals in Taiwan to be protected by the CCP.\n\n3. **High-Profile Targets**: The lists include Taiwanese legislators and public figures, with discussions on whether to expand the scope to local councilors and non-officials. Prominent names like Lai Ching-te and Tsai Ing-wen are mentioned.\n\n4. **Punishment of Former Defense Ministers**: The CCP announced severe punishments for former Defense Ministers Wei Fenghe and Li Shangfu, with Li facing the death penalty for political and organizational violations, including opposing Xi's Taiwan strategy.\n\n5. **Strategic Implications**: The article suggests that these actions are part of Xi's broader strategy to destabilize Taiwan and prepare for potential military action. It also highlights the CCP's influence within Taiwan and its efforts to undermine Taiwan's democracy.\n\n6. **International Context**: The article connects these developments to global geopolitics, including North Korea's involvement in Ukraine, which is seen as part of China's strategy to distract the West and weaken its response to potential conflicts in East Asia.\n\nThe article emphasizes the urgency for Taiwan and the international community to recognize and counter the CCP's aggressive tactics."

        "body": "刚刚看到一个大新闻：拜登决定退出竞选。\n\n我查了一下，这个消息的源头来自BillOReilly新闻总部的\"独家报道\"，说是拜登经过与家人和关系亲密者的商谈后，决定退出2024总统竞选，云云。\n\n这当然是无稽之谈了，事实恰恰相反，拜登得到了家人和民主党高层的一致支持，他不可能退选。并且我认为，除非在接下来几个月中拜登的健康状况出现了大问题，否则他将赢得这场选举。\n\n原因很简单，美国人民不喜欢拜登，但他们更讨厌川普。\n\n这个事情我说过很多次，最近的一次前两天，在电视辩论之后发的那篇短文：\"拜登：输了辩论又如何？\"。当时我曾经说过，\"这场辩论既无法撼动拜登的铁杆支持者，也难以让中间选民转向川普。就像观察家们所说，辩论会结束后，唯一可以确定的是，厌恶双方的选民都增加了\"。\n\n事实也的确如此。\n\n益普索（全球领先市场研究集团）的最新调查显示，辩论后美国选民对拜登和特朗普的看法几乎没有改变，46.7%的选民准备投票给拜登，而43.9%的选民支持特朗普。\n\n当然，最终拜登仍有可能输掉这场大选，尽管概率比较低。\n\n因为他实在太老，太迟钝了。如果换一个对手，他半点机会都没有，就像《时代周刊》在电视辩论结束后的这个经典的封面暗示的这样。\n\n那么，如果川普当选，会怎么样呢？\n\n首先，对于俄乌战争，我认为他不会让俄罗斯赢 -- -- 注意，是\"不让俄罗斯赢\"，而不是让俄罗斯输，这是他和拜登的区别。\n\n川普在电视辩论中表示，\"他不接受普京提出的结束战争的条件，其中包括俄罗斯保留领土主张和乌克兰放弃加入北约\"。\n\n我不认为这是一句谎言。\n\n但川普显然并不愿意长期支持乌克兰作战，这是一定的。因而他非常可能使用其所擅长的极限施压，让双方各退一步：乌克兰肯定会付出部分领土（虽然不会像普京要求的那样多），俄罗斯则可能不得不接受乌克兰加入北约。\n\n俄罗斯会答应吗？我认为会。\n\n我从不认为\"乌克兰不加入北约\"是普京的底线，挪威、波兰、波三小、芬兰、瑞典，北约早就在俄罗斯的家门口了，只要川普在乌克兰被占领土上给出一个妥协方案，普京完全可能会见好就收。因为他知道，如果特朗普也铁了心支持乌克兰，俄罗斯最后什么也得不到。\n\n那么乌克兰呢？\n\n我只能说泽连斯基和他的团队（民众的反应下次再聊）肯定不会接受，他们会在欧洲的支持下继续战斗。\n\n至于说\"欧洲强硬派会抢在川普上台前出兵乌克兰，造成北约参战的既成事实\"，我认为绝无可能。\n\n不管是杜达还是马克龙，都不可能大手一挥，派兵出乌克兰\"保家卫国\"，因为这样做必定会招到民众的反对。\n\n我知道这样说支持乌克兰的朋友会不高兴，但事实上除了部分理想主义者，没有人会愿意自己的加入这样一场残酷的战争。\n\n没办法，人性就是如此。\n\n人类历史上那些乌托邦的失败，正是由于拒绝承认人性中\"私\"的一面，同样的道理，在俄乌战争这件事情，你也不能只谈道义。\n\n因此，我坚持认为，除非俄军跨过第聂伯河，入侵乌西，对欧洲形成现实的威胁，否则欧洲国家不可能出兵 -- -- 实际上马克龙多次关于出兵的讲话，表达的就是这个意思。\n\n至于东大，无论川普还是拜登，差别只在于战术层面，总的战略不会有什么不同。对东大而言，变量在欧洲。\n\n前些天，乌克兰外交部长库莱巴对东大负责欧洲事务的特别代表表示，\"应从双边角度和从乌克兰未来加入欧洲联盟的角度战略性地看待两国关系的重要性\"，正是直击了这一要害。。。",

The source of this misinformation is identified as BillOReilly News Headquarters. Contrary to the report, Biden has received strong support from his family and Democratic Party leaders and is expected to continue his campaign unless significant health issues arise.\n\nThe article also touches on the general sentiment of American voters, noting that while Biden is not particularly popular, he is still preferred over former President Donald Trump. Recent polls show Biden leading Trump with 46.7% to 43.9% support.\n\nThe article speculates on the potential outcomes if Trump were to win the election, particularly regarding the Russia-Ukraine conflict. It suggests that Trump would not allow Russia to win but would likely push for a compromise, potentially involving territorial concessions from Ukraine and Russia's acceptance of Ukraine joining NATO. The article doubts that European countries would intervene militarily in Ukraine unless there is a direct threat to Europe.\n\nIn summary, the article debunks the rumor of Biden's withdrawal, highlights the current political landscape, and speculates on the implications of a potential Trump presidency on international conflicts."

        "title": "杨威：从美国大选辩论看中共衰败的必然 | 总统 | 川普 | 拜登 | 新唐人电视台",
        "body": "6月27日，美国两党推定总统候选人拜登和川普（特朗普）进行了大选前的首场辩论，引发各方的评头论足。不少华人应该颇有感触，事关中国老百姓生活的政策何时也能公开辩论呢？号称领导中国的中共高层也敢这般公开亮相吗？中南海一直在梦想着美国式的强大，怎奈实在学不来，而这也正是中共政权衰败的必然。中国人越来越看清了这一点。\n\n民意决定谁能做世界上最有权势的人\n\n拜登和川普都想通过此次辩论，争取更大的民意支持。美国总统常常被称为世界上最有权势的人，不过要赢取这一职位，必须得到美国选民的认可。候选人必须关注选民真正在意的话题，拿出有效的政策，否则选民不会买账。\n\n在中国大陆，中共以谎言、暴力拼命要维系一党专政，中共高层真正关心的只是如何压制民意，如何在内斗中千方百计地置政敌于死地，从而确保自己手中的权力和利益。因此，中共从上到下的官员们都不在乎民生、民意，他们不相信\"水能载舟亦能覆舟\"，当然更不相信天意。\n\n中共大小官员们很愿意找\"高人指点\"，但不是为了顺天意、民意行事；相反，他们为了能继续升官发财，往往还会逆天意而行，任意残害百姓、鱼肉百姓。\n\n美国大选辩论，各国都在关注，中南海也在关注，但中共高层绝对不会模仿，他们假意称\"为人民服务\"，甚至号称权力是\"人民给的\"；但他们始终都极力防止把权力交还给人民。\n\n中共官员们绝不敢把自己的无能展现在公众面前，更不能让老百姓知道他们实际只会念稿；假如也搞类似的辩论，中共高层只会丑态百出、不知所云，恐怕个个都得下台。\n\n中共江河日下，面对内外矛盾重重，中南海仍在试图掩盖自己的无能，千方百计地打压异音。然而，这并不能改变中共政权急速衰败、灭亡的命运；中南海一次次无奈地挣扎，都只会让脖子上的绞索套得更紧而已。\n\n中美老百姓都想过上好日子\n\n美国是世界第一强国，在诸多国际事务上发挥着领导作用，但美国选民首先关心的是自己的日常生活，经济是拜登和川普辩论的一大焦点话题。\n\n通货膨胀导致物价升高，美国人想维持同样的生活标准，不得不支出更多。选民的这种感觉对现任总统拜登不利，川普则在这个问题上采取攻势；但选民也会衡量，川普是否能做得更好。\n\n老百姓想过好日子，而且希望越过越好；很多美国选民现在似乎感觉不到。\n\n中国老百姓恐怕感触更深。近年来，中国没有明显的通货膨胀，往往还被称为通货紧缩，意味着经济活动在萎缩。中国大陆的失业者越来越多，最突出的是年轻人，包括刚刚毕业的大学生，很难找到工作。企业在倒闭、裁员，公务员都被减薪，消费不断降级，中国经济陷入恶性循环。中共高层束手无策，还连出昏招，对内打击民营企业，对外四处树敌，导致供应链加速外移，科技被卡脖子。\n\n如果按照民意，中南海里的人早就该下台了，但他们不愿下台，反而还要保党、保政权、保个人权位，变本加厉地高压维稳。他们表面上还在演戏，但内心越来越惶恐，恐怕也知道时日无多。\n\n经济全球化、民营企业的迅速发展，让中国经济过去几十年大幅增长，中共政权才得以继续存在；但大量财富被中共权贵搜刮，特权阶层不可能主动放弃特权，民营企业举步维艰。中共不可能允许市场经济，否则就失去了控制权，更没有了贪腐的机会。\n\n中共没有办法挽救经济，困境中的中国人在觉醒、在寻找出路，中国的变革已蓄势待发，中共退出历史舞台实属必然。中南海当然不愿面对公众的质疑，更不会搞美国式的辩论，但也改变不了下台的命运。\n\n本国人民需要首先得到关照\n\n拜登和川普辩论的另一大议题是非法移民。辩论之前，拜登出台了限制非法移民入境的措施。显然，拜登也知道非法移民激增会危害本国国民的利益，包括抢夺工作机会、分流有限的社会福利资源、导致社会治安问题等。\n\n川普2016年竞选时，就对非法移民问题进行了猛烈抨击，并获得了很多选民的支持，这也是他成功当选的重要因素之一。他还曾提出了\"美国优先\"，即本国人民需要首先得到关照。\n\n在这一点上，拜登也不敢怠慢，为了对抗中共的倾销，他保留了川普曾全部加征的对华关税，今年还专门针对中共的电动车出口等\"新三样\"加征最高100%的新关税。拜登也推动了《芯片法案》，布局芯片的美国生产线。这些做法都在努力保留美国工作机会，确保供应链安全。\n\n川普和拜登还会继续向选民展示自己关照本国国民的政策。这一点对中南海来说是无法做到的，中共高层不断四处调研，但根本没有在关注民生，只是在作秀。中国南方正持续发生水灾，中共高层与往年一样，至今没人到灾区视察、慰问。\n\n眼看外资撤离、外国人不愿到中国，中共单方面宣布对一系列国家实施免签，指望吸引外国人来华，但多数国家没有对等给中国公民免签。中共的做法可以说是丧权辱国，若是别人这样做，早就会被中共挂上\"崇洋媚外\"的标签。\n\n然而事与愿违，美国人、日本人相继在中国遇刺，中共的把戏不灵；只好用\"偶发事件\"搪塞，照例对内封锁消息，但对外封锁不了。中南海用对内维稳的模式对待涉外事件，但中国以外的人不会认可。中共对本国人民都不在乎，更不会在意中国以外的人。\n\n中共从未真正关照过本国人民，中国老百姓轻则被视为韭菜，重则随时可能被当作活摘器官的供体。这样邪恶的政权倒台只是时间问题，越折腾倒台就越快。\n\n外交能力的高下\n\n拜登和川普都希望证明自己处理国内问题的能力，也想证明自己更擅长处理外部事务。各国关注这场辩论，也正是因为美国有实力影响国际事务的方方面面。\n\n中南海时常标榜参与\"全球治理\"，实际没有多大影响力。中共高层不允许公众讨论外交问题，也不允许大多数官员讨论，更别说辩论了。至少过去5年来，中共外交迅速萎缩，所谓的\"大国外交\"惨不忍睹。\n\n2024年眼看过去一半，中共党魁唯一访问的大国只有法国，G7峰会更是摸不着边。中共与美国、英国、加拿大、日本全面交恶；德国、意大利有意疏远中共；法国总统马克龙当面要求中共党魁承诺不向俄罗斯提供武器，并坚定与美国站在一起。中日韩首脑峰会本是一个改善关系的机会，中共却仅派出不是二号人物的李强参加。\n\n李强随后又访问新西兰、澳大利亚，但他应该只能念稿，还不能接受记者提问。李强在夏季达沃斯论坛上表示，对中国经济不能下猛药，结果被中共党媒封杀。中共总理的头衔显然越发没有份量了。\n\n中共高层执意与美国对抗，不断散布反美宣传，中共官员们几乎都知道反美是死路一条，但没人敢说中共党魁错了。\n\n拜登和川普辩论如何解决俄乌战争；中共为了反美，选择支持俄罗斯继续消耗战，继而与北约、欧洲为敌。美欧提出中共的出口倾销和产能过剩问题，中南海强词夺理，最终换来了美欧的高关税。\n\n中共在外交上一错再错，中共高层还拼命在捂盖子，生怕内部的质疑。中共缺乏对抗美国、西方的本钱，中南海更极度缺乏对外打交道的能力。中共败坏了中国的国际形象，无端造成了中国人民利益的损失，把中国引向了歧途。中共代表不了中国，代表不了中国人民，更没有资格领导中国。\n\n6月28日，中南海再次作秀，在北京人民大会堂举办\"和平共处五项原则\"纪念大会。中共党魁高喊\"和平\"的当日，中共军舰却再度穿越日本岛屿间的狭窄海峡，中共也继续对台湾同胞咬牙切齿。\n\n中共此时对外喊话\"和平共处\"，实际深感内外危机难解，既怕内部再次生乱，又怕外部的持续打击。中共党魁的讲话仍然称\"反对搞阵营对抗\"和各种\"小圈子\"，反对\"强迫别国选边站队\"。\n\n中共实际在对美国和西方喊话，但拉来捧场的外国政要却仅有少数几个国家的前总统、前总理。西方各国已经再难与中共\"和平共处\"，中共的\"大国外交\"如今只剩下了喊话外交。\n\n结语\n\n美国为什么能成为世界第一强国？关注美国总统选举辩论的华人应该都多少知道了一些答案。美国总统、联邦众议员、参议员、各州州长和议会的产生，都要经过类似公开透明的竞选；美国经济活动更是充满市场竞争、创新不断；美国的各项职业体育赛事，同样因为竞争激烈而精彩纷呈，一直吸引着庞大的体育迷。\n\n中共一直高喊\"强国\"，如今越来越多的人也知道了为什么中国难以真正成为强国；因为1949年以来，一帮庸才、蠢才为了特权，始终霸占着中南海。中共治下的一切都是暗箱操作，生活在中国大陆的人很难获得公开、公平的竞争机会。\n\n中南海的精力都用在了如何维系一党专政、如何保住个人的权位；他们不懂治国，也不关心老百姓的生死；他们不能解决问题，却专门解决提出问题的人；甚至没人提出问题，他们若认为谁有问题，照样不会放过。\n\n6月27日，中共政治局开会宣布处理李尚福、魏凤和两任防长。这两个花瓶式人物的倒台，是中共二十大以来又一次招牌式的挫败。当天政治局还在学习\"全面从严治党\"，然而这个党已经没治了。\n\n本文只代表作者的观点和陈述。\n\n（转自大纪元/责任编辑：刘明湘）\n\n本文网址: https://www.ntdtv.com/gb/2024/07/01/a103893729.html",

        "title": "战火硝烟下，我在乌克兰住防空洞的日子",
        "body": "战火硝烟下，我在乌克兰住防空洞的日子\n\n两年多过去了，俄乌战争还在继续。\n\n有很多人回到了乌克兰的首都基辅，据国际移民局2023年5月的统计数据，已有480万乌克兰人返回了故土，基辅的人口已逐渐恢复到了战前的水准。\n\n从社交媒体上看，基辅似乎看起来跟其他的欧洲城市没什么差别，大街上人来人往，有说有笑。\n\n汶奇在2023年8月份重返了基辅，他体会到了基辅的变与不变。每次走在街上，只要不刻意地去想跟战争相关的事情，他就觉得跟平常一样。\n\n但防空警报每天都在响，尤其喜欢在半夜响起，声音就像盘旋在上空的110出警铃声。偶尔，汶奇会听到室外的爆炸声，他形容那种声响像是来自低云层的雷声。\n\n这两个月来，汶奇第一次在基辅经历大规模的停电。俄罗斯的空袭摧毁了基辅最大的发电站，而紧急从邻国\"借\"来的电并不能满足庞大的人口所需。\n\n我们第一次通话是在5月底，当时汶奇住在基辅的学生宿舍，一天有时停电3、4个小时。到了6月初，我们第二次通话时，他住进了本科导师在基辅州乡下的房子，有时一天只有两三个小时有电，且不知道来电的准确时间。\n\n因此，我们没法约定具体的访谈时间。到了约定的日期，基辅时间下午一点多，他终于联系上我。他的原话是，\"现在来电了，但可能半小时左右停电\"。时间远远不够，我只能听天由命。万幸，当天我们聊了两个小时，汶奇才打断我，\"这里快停电了\"。\n\n其他的一些改变是，重返校园后，这里冒出了很多汶奇不认识的新面孔。而大部分他熟悉的面孔，有的上战场，有的出国，一切好像都回不去了。\n\n去乌克兰留学，是汶奇过往的人生中做过最勇敢的一个决定。原本，他应该按父母的期望，在国内念一个大学，毕业后就进体制内单位的。可战争将他一切的计划都打断了，他被迫回国，甚至还休学了一年。\n\n2023年8月，我准备从上海出发回基辅，继续我中断的本科学业。\n\n我是上大二那年，这边开始打仗的。之后，虽然所有课程都转到了线上，但像我们学大提琴的，上网课很不方便，也没啥效果。很快，我就跟另一个同学一起休了学。\n\n我原本计划着先在国内等，战争一结束就回基辅继续上学。可我休学了一年后，战争还是没结束，我不想再这样耗下去。当时，我身边也有一些留学生回到了基辅，当地的情况似乎还是比较乐观的。最终，我下定决心要回去上学。\n\n出发当天，我是从上海先飞土耳其的伊斯坦布尔，第二程再飞摩尔多瓦，最后从摩尔多瓦坐大巴入境乌克兰。战争期间，乌克兰是没有制空权的，没有哪个航空公司敢进到这里的领空。因此，都得从邻国坐火车或大巴进乌克兰。\n\n从摩尔多瓦入境乌克兰基辅的大巴车\n\n除了摩尔多瓦，还有不少跟乌克兰接壤的国家，比如波兰、罗马尼亚等。但这些都是欧盟国家，签证审查比较严，不如摩尔多瓦的好办。2022年俄乌战争爆发那次，我是从波兰回的国。当时，波兰政府就给了我一个过境签。\n\n上海飞的航班是晚上的，到摩尔多瓦是第二天中午左右。我当时纠结要不要在当地住一晚？\n\n我当时心里很忐忑，听说很多朋友都被海关给劝返回国了。于是我四处打听，问朋友他们是怎么走的，怎么弄，去哪儿订大巴？最终，一位乌克兰本地的朋友直接给我订了大巴票，我咬咬牙当天就出发了。\n\n出发的大巴车上，只有两个外国人，除了我，还有一个\"印度老表\"。其他的，要么是乌克兰人，要么是摩尔多瓦人。我听说摩尔多瓦有一些亲戚在乌克兰，他们之间可能会相互拜访。\n\n整辆车，也只有我俩是青壮年男性，其余的要么是老年人，要么就是妇女。在乌克兰，征兵年龄段以内的男性，是出不了境的。除非是货运司机，或者你能拿出其他的证明文件。\n\n过摩尔多瓦海关是第一关，我身边很多朋友都是好不容易从摩尔多瓦坐大巴到边境，结果却被海关遣返回国了。\n\n遣返的理由有很多，战争期间，没有正当理由海关是不会放行的。就算是来念书的，还需要乌克兰的学校给这边的海关发邮件或打电话，说明学校的哪个同学需要回来。\n\n可即便学校打了电话、发了邮件，具体还得看当地海关放不放你进。对那些准备在乌克兰入学的新生来说，只有学校的邀请函或签证，没有当地的居留证，拒签率几乎是100%。我还听说，有学校老师直接开车去海关，想接学生进，都接不进来。\n\n我是战前就在乌克兰，也办了当地的居留证，因而幸运地被摩尔多瓦海关放行了。过乌克兰海关是第二关，我还记得凌晨两点左右，我已经睡着了。有一个拿着手电筒，扛着枪的女军警走上车，拍了拍我说，收护照。\n\n等我的护照被拿回来时，司机大哥顺口问，这是哪个国家的护照。他们得知我是中国人后，都很意外，觉得中国人怎么会在这个时间点来呢？在此之前，他们都以为我是印度人，我当时的肤色也很\"印度\"。我是云南的，当时被晒得黢黑，搞得\"印度老表\"一上车就热情地问我是印度哪个城市的？\n\n车里只有我们两个外国人，过海关时，司机很怕我俩的证件出问题，耽误事。当时，我想下车去上厕所，可厕所只有乌克兰海关里有。必须得等上一个人回来，下一个人才能接着去上，有点像小学上课（要上厕所）一样。\n\n我刚想下车，司机就嘱咐我，\"你别上了，你如果上完赶不上车怎么办？护照检查没事就赶紧走吧\"。\n\n我们的大巴车是从西边入境乌克兰的，到基辅时，天已经亮了。\n\n大巴车经过的第一个点就是我第一次来乌克兰住的地方，接着，我又路过了第二个住过的公寓，第三个住过的房子，一直到终点站。\n\n我的鼻腔有点发酸，感觉关于战争的一切就像一场梦，梦醒了，基辅的一切都没有变，时间也停留在了那个最美好的时候。\n\n我盯着那些房子看得发呆，房子还是那个房子，但房子里的人呢？朋友们在社交媒体上发布的照片提醒我，他们已经上战场了。我跟他们的聊天记录大多停留在战前。这一切都不是梦，已经回不去了。\n\n战争的蛛丝马迹\n\n我每次走在基辅的街上，只要不刻意去想战争的话，就觉得跟平常一样。这大概是因为，在基辅，路面的修缮一直在进行。哪怕可能一炸就没了，但该有的还是要有。\n\n除了偶尔会在街上看到那种拦截坦克的\"捷克刺猬\" -- -- 这是战争留下来的，平时会放置在马路旁边，我的思绪才会被拉回到战时。\n\n防空警报基本每天都会响，尤其是在夜里。在夜里，我通常会刻意不让自己睡得太死，但实在太困我也控制不住。理论上，只要防空警报一响，就需要跑去防空洞。\n\n在基辅市区，拍下的防空导弹轨迹图\n\n但我一般都是防空警报一响，第一时间看群里的新闻。如果新闻里说的是\"无人机轰炸\"，那么我就接着睡。对付无人机，基辅的防空系统还是绰绰有余。\n\n如果新闻里说\"轰炸机来袭\"，那么我就要让自己清醒起来，有可能会去防空洞。可如果新闻里说\"战斗机或导弹已经发射了\"，那么我就会毫不犹豫跑去防空洞。\n\n不同的导弹，留给我们的逃生时间还不一样。比如\"高超音速导弹\"，逃生时间就只有10～15分钟。如果是\"巡航导弹\"，逃生时间就会有半个小时。所有的这些信息，实时新闻里都会写明。\n\n重回基辅的第一天，本地同学就给我手机装了好几个防空警报的软件。一旦有空袭，它们就会来轰炸我的耳朵，就跟那些老人机似的。\n\n回想战争刚爆发，第一次响防空警报时，我还毫无感觉。当时，我连觉都没睡醒，就被我室友摇起来说，打仗了。我以为我在做梦呢？\n\n很快，我觉得好像空气里都有股火药味。我第一次有那种未知的恐惧，觉得一旦暴露在外，可能瞬间我这人就没了。不知道什么时候来颗导弹，我人就挂了。\n\n打仗的第一天，大家就老老实实待在防空洞里。因为不知道外面什么情况，我们只能在手机上看新闻，过一会儿就越看越毛 -- -- 一开始说只是导弹轰炸，到后面就说什么地面部队已经向基辅进发了。\n\n战争爆发时，躲在防空洞的汶奇与他的同学们\n\n到了第二天、第三天，大家就慢慢松懈下来，就觉得这个事既然已经发生了，那也没办法，然后就开始该做饭做饭。\n\n那几天，中国留学生天天聚在一起做饭，我最记得北方的同学在那包饺子，南方的就在那炒菜。平时，大家都是几个土豆胡乱了事。一打仗，大家是能吃多好吃多好，弄得热火朝天，就跟过年了似的。\n\n管你防空警报响不响，我们就在宿舍上面做我们的饭。搞得乌克兰人都很诧异，都什么时候了，这些中国人还有心情做饭？\n\n事后回想，啼笑皆非。我觉得这也跟我们这些人从没经历过战争，觉得战争只在电影、电视剧或游戏里存在一样有关。\n\n反观我的乌克兰同学，本地学生能走的都走了，不能走的，他们也是一响防空警报，立马去防空洞。他们做饭要么是在防空洞里做，要么就在宿舍做好了，然后端到防空洞吃。不像我们，只有听到外面爆炸了，才吓得赶紧去防空洞躲一躲。\n\n汶奇拍下的刚开战时的基辅vs第二次回来时的基辅\n\n当时，本地学生的心情也跟我们不太一样。我记得，战争的第一天，几乎所有的乌克兰人都在哭。而我们哭，都是因为看到当地人的遭遇。\n\n就这样，我终于回了国，学业被打断、一切计划也被打乱。当时，我连吃饭的家伙 -- -- 大提琴都没带走，它被放在学校的防空洞里。这也是我想重回学校的一个原因。\n\n这次重回学校，大提琴是找到了，可我的那口\"贵锅\" -- -- 那是我在战前，稀里糊涂花1000多人民币买的，却没了。我经常拿这件事调侃，我在乌克兰念了快五年书（预科一年、本科四年），混得连口锅都没有。\n\n我现在也不想重新买锅，就跟隔壁宿舍的共用一口锅。锅铲我也是借的，谱架也是，能凑合就凑合着用。战前，我买一个东西时会考虑\"这个东西会用比较久，我要买好一点的\"。但现在，我是越简单越好，（再好的东西）说不准哪天就没了，什么都没了。\n\n所有的东西都可以转瞬即逝，生命也是。\n\n大规模停电的基辅\n\n回基辅快一年，停电是这两个月才开始的。\n\n5月份，我住在基辅的学生宿舍，当时还是按区域轮流停电。比如，同一个时间段，有可能这条街有电，那条街就没电。我们装了一款手机软件，里面可以查停电的时间段。\n\n当时，每天都可能停电，有时候停一次，有时停两次，一天通常停3、4个小时。但到6月初，我住进本科导师在基辅州乡下的房子时，一天就只来一次或两次电，一次一两个小时。停电越来越严重，那款手机软件也越来越不准时，有时候上面说什么时候来电，结果又没来。\n\n跟基辅市区比，乡下的电力情况还要好一点，之前基本都不停电，除了这次。\n\n我在国内也经历过停电，停了电还能用4G网。但在这边不可能，基辅一停电，可能是把移动网络的基站都给关了。在基辅市区，一停电，网络就会很卡。而到乡下，只要一停电，我连手机的短信都收不到，一点信号都没有。\n\n在乡下，一停电，导师家的抽水机也罢工，水也停了。对现代社会来说，停水停电简直是要命。我也是生平第一次经历这样的事，哪怕2022年打仗时，都没停过电。\n\n住在基辅高层公寓的人更惨，比如我导师在基辅的公寓是14楼，一停电，电梯也不动了。我导师八十多岁了，左腿还出过车祸，基本走不动了。我导师住的公寓只能用电磁炉炒菜，一停电，菜也炒不了，楼也下不了，很难办。\n\n也因此，我导师一有空就会往他在乡下的房子跑，一是乡下可以用瓦斯炒菜。二是他可以住一楼。乌克兰这边正常是60岁退休，但我导师非常热爱他的工作，就一直干。他属于是乌克兰的功勋艺术家，在国家最厉害的乐团干了二三十年首席。\n\n在基辅，一些新修的公寓或写字楼，会在电梯里放一个急救包 -- -- 里面有水、巧克力啥的，还有尿布，以防电梯的人在停电后出不来。不过，这样的急救包一般很难用到。\n\n更难熬的是没有电的冬天，基辅的冬天最冷可以到零下十几度，一停电，暖气也用不了。记得有一年冬天，我当时在国内，听我基辅当地的朋友说停电很严重。\n\n朋友还告诉我，政府在很多社区建了\"无敌点\"，就是临时的庇护所，里面有电、有暖气，有热水，还有些食物啥的。大家就这么硬撑着过了几个月，后面情况就好转了。\n\n停电的夜晚，我一般会先用户外灯撑一撑，等到户外灯没电时，我就会点起蜡烛。在宿舍的很多个夜晚，我都会边点蜡烛边练琴，这很常见。而到了乡下，蜡烛也变得越来越稀缺。天一黑，我就摸黑拉琴。\n\n很多人家里会自备发电机，这在乡下更常见。在基辅市区，一些商场、超市或药店等，也会备发电机。一停电，就可以用发电机顶上。\n\n但我导师家没有发电机，一停电，网也没，水也没，感觉自己真是\"一觉回到了解放前\"（捂脸哭）。我只能安慰自己，这里适合闭关练琴，正好现在快期末考了。\n\n涨薪的速度追不上物价\n\n这次电力短缺之后，现在在外面租公寓，都要付双倍电费。\n\n我战前租过的公寓，当时夏天吹空调的话，一个月一个人的水电花费等 -- -- 这边叫公用事务费用，会将水、电等费用统计到一个账单，就要500块人民币左右，很贵。更别提现在，我连公寓的电费都付不起。\n\n支付双倍电费，也是因为基辅最大的发电站被炸了，而基辅又是这边人口最多、用电量最大的城市，发电站一时半会儿修不好，就只能从其他国家\"借电\"过来，就很贵。\n\n基辅的公寓一般分成两种，一种就像国内的赫鲁晓夫楼，这种是没有保安的，只有一个单元门。我记得战前，找一个这样的老公寓，交通便利点的，也要一千五六每月。另一种新的公寓楼，有门卫，类似国内的小区，但价格很贵很贵，战前就要三四千一个月。\n\n跟国内一样，这边租公寓也要付中介费跟押金，这样一来就更贵了。打仗之后，现在最划不来的就是租房子。因为你不知道后面会发生什么事儿，哪怕之后你人撤走了，但还有一些东西留在房子里，房东一样会让你付房租。\n\n在基辅市区，其他物价也都在涨，几乎每个超市里的所有东西，每个月都在换价格。我记得之前去学校附近最高档的超市，随便买点东西，差不多也就是一百多两百一个人。现在就连我们宿舍旁边那个超市，我进去随便买个鸡蛋，再买点啥，都得人民币一百多。\n\n我经常去吃的那家煎饼店，它每次出新价格就拿胶布粘上去，老的（价签）也不撕。短短一两个月，它那个胶布厚得不知道有多离谱。按当地币格里夫纳算，涨了估计得有二十。\n\n这边在外面吃非常贵，最便宜的就是这个煎饼，一个煎饼现在也要人民币十五六块了。我老说，如果这边有国内那种十多块钱的盒饭，我肯定是第一个去办年卡的。\n\n物价飞涨，最近看新闻，当地的平均薪资涨了一些。基辅的工资真的不高，拿我导师来说，他在国家最厉害的乐团干首席，已经干到头了，一个月的退休金加工资也就1000美金（约7250人民币）。\n\n但在基辅，现在一个月哪怕都自己做饭，生活费也至少要两三千人民币。很多人还要租房，战前最便宜的公寓也要一千五百多人民币，现在租金也涨了很多。所以，普通人不涨工资真是活不下去。\n\n再说了，薪资再涨，也赶不上当地币贬值的速度。我记得19年刚来基辅时，美金兑当地币格里夫纳的汇率（以下简称汇率）是，1美元换当地币24或25，最高时28。打仗的前两天，汇率又到了1:30或31。打仗之后，汇率一路飙到了1:40。\n\n如果当地币再这么跌下去，那跟废纸还有什么区别？最后政府要求强制封盘，汇率跌到40之后，就不能再往下了。可这次大规模停电之后，估计汇率怕是跌破了40。\n\n我在基辅一般都用美元，我轻易不会换当地币，除非我知道自己要用多少，当天就把它花掉，不会存在手里等着它贬值。\n\n看汇率，也成了我的生活日常，每次上街我都会去看。现在，正常的汇率是1:36到38区间。如果汇率跌破了38，那可能就意味着最近会有轰炸，或是其他不好的事情。汇率的变化，一般会比实际发生轰炸等事件，要早个一两天。\n\n一旦汇率异常，我会第一时间把自己的大提琴拿去防空洞，这样防空警报一响，我就能跑得更快。\n\n回乡下的基辅人\n\n跟基辅市区比，我现在住的乡下，虽然停电停水，却也算是不愁吃喝。\n\n我住在导师家的阁楼，一下楼就是他家的院子，他们平常休息就在前院，是一大片草坪，旁边还长了些迷迭香之类的香料。\n\n后院需要我拐个弯才能到，很大一块地方，种满了各种果树，有苹果树、梨树、李子树，还种了草莓、小瓜，塑料大棚里还种了番茄和黄瓜。当然，这些农作物基本都是我导师托邻居帮忙打理的。\n\n如果有自家菜园还没有长好的，我导师又很想吃的，就可以去镇上买。镇上每天都可以买到新鲜的蔬果，比如刚从地里拿出来的黄瓜、土豆。\n\n我导师家的房子很大，家里的设施也很齐全，壁炉、烧烤的地方都有。不过，一出家门，我现在住的这个村子，村里的路基本是那种石头路，有些路段还有那种老土路。村里路灯也有，但也要看路段。\n\n由于这边都是私人土地，即便只是在村子里建一个路灯，也需要这段路的所有居民都同意，大家都出这个钱，才能建得起来。也因此，这边乡下的基础设施参差不齐，有些村子的村民有钱，就把路弄得好一点。有些村子大家都不愿意盖，就是那种老土路。总的来说，这边乡下整体的基础设施比不上国内那种政府帮建的\"最美乡村\"。\n\n到了周末，排队出基辅市区的人，非常多。像我导师一样乡下跟市区都有房的人，到了周末，都恨不得往乡下跑吧。\n\n住在乡下的另一个好处是，听不到防空警报。相比基辅市区，村子里相对更安全。因为这里没什么军事设施、也没什么能源设施，他炸了也没用。而且一颗导弹就价值几千万美金，也不太会拿它来炸村子。\n\n除非地面部队进来占领土地，才会波及到村子，否则他们是不会轻易来轰炸村子的。村子里也没有防空洞，但这边会有地窖，有点像国内北方的村子，他们会把秋天吃不完的东西存在地窖里。地窖，就类似村子里的防空洞。\n\n住在村子里的这段时间，我因此也睡得更香甜，无所谓什么防不防空警报。\n\n我算是同学中唯一一个住进导师乡下家里的学生，他就在家里给我上\"小课\"。这是导师主动提出来的，因为他有一次跟着乐团去日本巡演，好几个月没能给我上课，他就想着给我补课。有过第一次后，这好像就变成了一个\"传统\"，我每个学期都要来。\n\n不过，说是说\"小课\"，但我导师一分钱都不收我的。我还想着不收钱，那就买点菜、买点米，他也不收，还让我在那吃、在那住。\n\n我们处得很好，跟俩爷孙一样。我经常开玩笑跟他说，他这个级别的艺术家，放在国内，上一节\"小课\"都得好几千一小时。他就回我，\"那好，我要去中国当百万富翁\"。\n\n事实上，自从打仗后，我导师一步都没离开过基辅。最严重的时候，军队都已经打到基辅外围了，我当时在回国路上，一直打电话劝他出国躲一躲。他不在征兵的年龄段，是可以出国的。他还有很多欧洲的亲戚和朋友，也都劝他。\n\n住回基辅市区后，一有休息，我基本就会去听音乐会。打仗之后，这边有非常多的音乐会，街边、音乐厅、博物馆，到处都是。我感觉现在的音乐会比战前还多。\n\n基辅战后的音乐会，大多与战争有关\n\n对音乐专业的学生来说，这是好事，我们能得到的表演机会变多了。以前挤破脑袋才能争取到的表演机会，现在变得非常多。\n\n我见过的大部分音乐会都是募捐性质的，比如给前线士兵买物资。也有一些实践性质的音乐会，就是演奏一些新的音乐作品，这些作品多是战争期间创作的，以学生创作的为主。\n\n我印象最深的一场音乐会，就属于实践一类的音乐会。它开在基辅的一个小剧场 -- -- 它也是咖啡厅，平时会做一些小型的放映。当晚，音乐人在台上演奏，背景播放的是她在前线城市走访拍的纪录片。纪录片拍到了这些城市的街景、废墟，更多的是讲述老百姓的故事。\n\n我记得，片子中间讲了个小女孩的故事，她在战争中失去了自己的爸爸妈妈，几乎一夜之间家里面的人都没了，家也变成了废墟......\n\n拍纪录片的是位乌克兰女生，她应该是属于志愿兵。我身边的当地朋友，也有女生去参军的，大部分我玩得好的男生朋友，都在部队。\n\n现在，基辅市区的音乐会多了很多，但我们学校却变得越来越冷清。\n\n下：汶奇（最右）与其他音乐人得到的演出机会在变多\n\n每次经过学校的大教室，我都会回忆起战前，几乎每天晚上，这里都会有各种专业的学生一起玩，一起搞音乐会。管你是学古典乐的，还是玩爵士的，都可以一起玩。弹贝斯的跟拉大提琴的一起，吹萨克斯的也跟小提琴的凑一块儿。\n\n可现在，学校里也多了很多我不认识的新生。那些我认识的朋友，有的上战场，有的出国，恐怕再也回不到当时了。\n\n再过一年，我也将完成学业离开乌克兰，我永远不会忘记我的朋友们，和这段留学经历。\n\n注：以上照片均由受访者汶奇提供。",

        "summary": "The article recounts the experiences of Wenqi, a Chinese student, living in Kyiv, Ukraine, during the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. Despite the war, Kyiv's population has been gradually returning, with 4.8 million Ukrainians having come back by May 2023. Wenqi returned to Kyiv in August 2023 to resume his interrupted studies. He describes the daily air raid alarms, occasional explosions, and the significant power outages caused by Russian airstrikes on Kyiv's largest power plant. These outages have led to severe disruptions, including limited electricity and water supply.\n\nWenqi's journey back to Kyiv involved flying from Shanghai to Istanbul, then to Moldova, and finally taking a bus into Ukraine due to the lack of air travel into the war zone. He faced challenges at border crossings but managed to enter Ukraine thanks to his pre-war residency permit.\n\nIn Kyiv, Wenqi observed both changes and continuities. The city appears normal on the surface, but the war's impact is evident in the frequent air raid alarms and the presence of tank barriers. He also noted the rising cost of living and the devaluation of the local currency, making daily life increasingly expensive.\n\nWenqi's narrative highlights the resilience of Kyiv's residents, who continue to live their lives amidst the war. He also reflects on the emotional toll of the conflict, the loss of friends who have gone to the front lines or left the country, and the uncertainty of the future. Despite these challenges, Wenqi remains determined to complete his studies and cherishes the support of his mentor and the sense of community among his peers."

        "body": "中华民国总统赖清德在中国眼中是个台独份子，尽管自他上任以来试图对中国释出善意，但是北京政府始终充耳不闻。研究当代中国的法国学者蓝可（Emmanuel Lincot）指出，中国官方语言一向轻忽赖清德，但又自相矛盾的，在赖清德上任初期，便举行具重大威胁性的大规模军演，对他施展不成比例的武力。在台海情势压力未降低之时，蓝可指出，中国目前不会武力攻打台湾。他甚至认为，中国最终不会选择武力，而是运用经济手段压制台湾。\n\n蓝可说：「我认为中国目前不会真正动用武力攻打台湾。我们可从不同面向观察，例如现在透过Google，就能轻易得知福建、广东是否有军舰聚集，我们并未见到解放军有登陆的准备。我也认为，中国最终不打算使用武力，而会运用经济手段压制台湾。依我看，这是比较明智的作法，成本也较低。如果中国攻打台湾，那会演变成世界大战，对中国丝毫没有好处，道理就是这么简单。」\n\n蓝可观察赖清德上任一个多月来，延续蔡英文政策。仅管理性看来，中国和台湾之间眼前不会爆发冲突。但他表示，永远不要低估中国领导人的非理性。中国和俄国一样，面对明确的目标，都提出论述合理化他们的行动，例如北京宣称台湾自古就属于中国的一部分。他们展现出理性的一面，但其中有矛盾，西方人很难理解。以俄乌战争为例，法国总统马克龙直到俄国军队进入乌克兰领土的当天，都还以为他可以和普丁如常的沟通。蓝可说，依西方民主体制的标准来看，普丁不是正常人，习近平也不是。在西方人眼中，武力战争是自杀式的作法。台海冲突不只对世界会是灾难，对中国也是。\n\n「战争要付出代价，我不确定中国是否可长期支撑武力冲突。中国势必面对禁运制裁，显露自身的脆弱性。大家很快想到科技层面，但不只这个面向，我认为，最重要的是粮食安全问题。中国高度依赖粮食进口，如遭到制裁，那会是灾难。」蓝可说。\n\n虽然中国不断秀武力，展露威吓，但事实上，中国无法自外于世界。战争对中国人民会产生灾难性后果，连带影响中共政权。蓝可表示，尽管外界看中国一直存在有好战的民意声浪，但必须正视一点：中国经济正陷入困境。官方数字显示，城市失业率高达20％，而自去年6月以后便不再公布失业数据，令人想像失业率继续攀升。过去几年来，疫情重创民众的生活，有数十万维持平日生活运转的商家倒闭，在缺乏失业补助、和社福系统支持下，导致许多人的生活不稳定，在社会间营造焦虑气氛。\n\n蓝可又说，习近平在俄乌战争中支持普丁，并未在中国内部获得全面支持。中国因支持俄国，与美国对立，如果另再加上台湾因素，那真的是雪上加霜，中国民意没有准备好要面对这样的情况。\n\n尽管种种迹象指出，挑起武力冲突对中国不利。但是蓝可另外提到一个令人忧心的因素，中国目前的处境类似二次世界大战前、1930年代的日本，在世界上越来越遭到孤立，他们自认受威胁，或者想像受到来自西方世界的威胁，于是选择开战。蓝可说，美国今年大选结果不明，法国及欧盟没有意愿、也没有资源关注台海局势，无论情势如何演变，台湾只能倚赖自身实力捍卫生存权。",

        "summary": "**Summary:**\n\nFrench scholar Emmanuel Lincot discusses the Taiwan Strait conflict, focusing on Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te, whom China views as a pro-independence figure. Despite Lai's attempts to show goodwill, China has responded with large-scale military exercises. Lincot believes China will not use military force against Taiwan but will instead employ economic pressure, which is more cost-effective and less risky. He notes that while current tensions are high, an actual conflict is unlikely due to the potential global repercussions and China's economic vulnerabilities, such as dependence on food imports. Lincot also highlights internal challenges in China, including high urban unemployment and economic struggles, which could deter military action. He warns, however, that China's international isolation could lead to unpredictable actions, drawing a parallel to Japan in the 1930s. Ultimately, Lincot suggests that Taiwan must rely on its own strength for survival, as international support may be limited."

If this trend continues, Germany could set a new record for arms exports by the end of the year. The German Ministry of Economic Affairs reported a 30% year-on-year increase in arms exports, totaling at least €7.48 billion by June 18, 2024. Despite the ruling coalition's initial promise to limit arms exports, especially to non-EU and non-NATO countries, the Russian invasion of Ukraine led to a surge in arms deliveries. Ukraine received nearly two-thirds of Germany's arms exports, amounting to €4.88 billion. Other major recipients included Singapore, India, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar. The data was released at the request of Sevim Dagdelen from the newly formed BSW party, who criticized the government for increasing arms exports to conflict zones, warning of potential escalation into a European war."

        "body": "今天是俄乌战争第859天，根据乌总参公布的最新数据，在过去24小时里全线发生了117次战斗，俄罗斯军队共损失1110人，坦克19辆，装甲车26辆，火炮66门......\n\n目前,俄乌战线的整体局势已在潜移默化中发生改变，这一变化既符合美西方援助到来后的路线图，也是军事辩证法通过不断消耗敌人战争资源战改变双方力量对比的规律论。\n\n战况方面\n\n在哈尔科夫以北的沃夫昌斯克，继29日夜乌军对俄军发动月夜攻势后昨日又向俄罗斯人又发起了一次大的进攻，迫使俄军主力不断的向两国边界撤退。\n\n目前在哈尔科夫以北，沃夫昌斯克战场的俄军已开始败退，利普奇战场还在激战，但乌军已完全占据了优势，俄军面临的困难越来越多......首先是补给问题，由于乌克兰军队不断地打击俄本土边境地区的俄军兵力集结、军事装备以及补给线，导致了俄军的后勤被严重削弱。\n\n其次是士气问题，人海冲锋与人肉进攻造成的巨大伤亡让俄军的溃逃与投降已成为了普遍性现象，在乌军昨日的进攻中，出现了大量有关车臣督战队与被督战俄军一起拒绝作战的报到。\n\n军事博主伊里奇洛夫称：\"乌克兰军队已加快了对沃夫昌斯克进攻，试图通过包围来获得胜利，这样的战术结果难度就大。乌军将俄军第2次赶出哈尔科夫或许能够做到，打歼灭战却不容易，因为该地区位于边境，俄军随时随地可以撤回国内......\"我们认为这种认知是客观的。\n\n战线南下\n\n在东线克雷明纳，我们昨日报道了乌军第12特战旅、第95空突旅及13猎兵旅联手将色雷不良斯基森林地区俄军赶出了阵地......昨日下午，乌军第46旅又在克雷明纳西边的特尔尼与南面的扬波力夫卡发起了反击，从俄罗斯人手里夺回6.4平方公里领土。\n\n以下绿色地区为俄军色雷不良斯基森林阵地，箭头为收复地区\n\n在巴赫穆特的卡索夫亚尔，乌克兰军队昨日击败了俄军425突击营后继续反推，在运河以西和南部种植园方向均取得了进展，从而让恰索夫亚尔防线固若金汤。\n\n该战场此前一直是乌军压力最大的地方，俄国防部给该地区俄军下达的命令是5月9日前攻克恰索夫亚尔......攻坚的俄近卫第76空降师、风暴Z部队等战斗单元在滑翔炸弹加持下一直疯狂进攻......经过长时间消耗后俄罗斯人的进攻动能如今越来越弱。\n\n战场之外\n\n尽管俄罗斯6月13日和6月25日连续两次抛出和谈意向，但均被乌克兰拒绝，因为普京的和谈基础是乌军撤出乌东四州以及不得加入北约。毫无诚意的和谈条件乌克兰显然不会接受，不仅乌克兰无法接受，就连俄罗斯本国国民也觉得是天方夜谭。俄罗斯网友谢尔盖.亚克称：\"这不是和谈，是继续战争的宣言\"；科兹洛夫吐槽称\"眼看特别军事行动前景越来越渺茫，这样的条件有什么建设性价值呢？\"\n\n俄罗斯电报群今日消息：克里米亚大桥疑遭到导弹袭击，巨大爆炸声震惊居民，多辆救护车紧急赶往现场......有消息称这是乌克兰F-16的首次战果，该消息虽未得到证实，但克里米亚大桥关键部位受损的消息已在莫斯科传遍，电报群中的悲痛或许就是最好证明。\n\n基辅邮报30日消息，匈牙利总理欧尔班表示下周将访问乌克兰，改善两国关系。一直以来匈牙利身在欧盟和北约，却始终与俄罗斯眉来眼去，不仅拒绝援助乌克兰，还在援乌问题上屡屡行使否决权，让欧盟其他国家大为恼火，受到成员国共同抵制以及欧盟的惩罚后这个骑墙派近来已有所收敛，开始支持乌克兰加入欧盟谈判。\n\n盖洛普民意调查最新结果显示，普京在俄罗斯年轻人中的支持率已从曾经的85%跌到如今的15%。全俄舆论中心发布了普京的信用评级仅剩下31%的报告。与此同时，4个邻国的俄族人对普京的支持率也出现了大幅度下跌，亚美尼亚俄族人对普京的支持率从45%跌为26%，哈萨克斯俄族人对普京支持率从55%下跌到29%，亚美尼亚从45%下跌到了32%，吉尔吉斯坦也跌了15个百分点......百度AI对于普京支持率下跌到15%给出的答案是：\n\n俄罗斯媒体消息，俄罗斯大邻居的一架运20a军用运输机昨日降落在了莫斯科，去干什么谁也不知道，但总让人忐忑不安，多事之秋......\n\n与此同时，俄罗斯和印度联合军工企向菲律宾交付的第1套布拉莫斯反舰导弹。制造商亚历山大.马克西切夫在回复向马尼拉交付导弹问题上称：我们完成了3个作战单位供应，并对菲方人员进行了培训，这只是交易的初始阶段，我们还将继续向菲方交付更多的导弹......俄罗斯高等经济学院高级研究员瓦西里卡申采访时表示：\"布拉莫斯是在印度生产的，属于俄罗斯玛瑙反舰导弹的许可版，这是一种高超音速导弹，射程300公里，将确保菲律宾能够击沉敌人的水面舰艇，在一定程度上加强菲律宾海上防御力量，威慑个别国家......\"\n\n从俄朝签订盟友关系条约到帮助越南发展核技术，再到向菲律宾交付高超音速反舰导弹，克里姆林宫做这一切究竟是为对付谁不言而喻......庆父不死，鲁难不已，一个风雨飘摇的没落政府直到如今还要兴风作浪，看来，除恶务尽完全有必要！祝福乌克兰，也坚信乌克兰将士一定会越战越勇，蜇龙腾空，飞剑斩长鲸！",

        "body": "今日内容\n\n乌成功局部反击 苦战无果 3万俄军被困\n\nF-16或已首战乌克兰 何时能完全掌握制空权？\n\n更多俄高级官员被通缉 以色列要援8套爱国者\n\n聚焦战场动态，剖析地缘争端，欢迎收看新冷战情室，我是远山。\n\n今天是2024年7月1日，俄乌战争进入第859天。6月30日，乌克兰对克里米亚的占科伊、塞瓦斯托波尔和辛菲罗波尔发起导弹和无人机袭击。同时，俄罗斯六个州遭到数十架无人机的袭击，这种情况在俄罗斯已经成为常态。据俄媒报导，俄罗斯防空系统击落了36架乌克兰无人机。\n\n与此同时，乌克兰持续打击俄军的防空系统、雷达、炼油厂、油库和补给线，从源头上摧毁俄罗斯的能源经济，削弱其战争投入。\n\n乌成功局部反击 3万俄军被困\n\n在战场上，乌克兰继续清除俄军的有生力量和装备，现在俄军已经将二战时期的摩托车维修后投入战场，装备损失严重程度，可想而知。乌克兰的持续消耗战正在让俄罗斯陷入进退两难的境地，这种压力或许很快就会达到临界点。\n\n哈尔科夫地区，乌军向利博克（Hlyboke）和斯塔里齐亚（Starytsia）、沃夫昌斯克发动反击。战争研究所报告称，哈尔科夫北部的局势已经稳定。\n\n俄军多个旅崩溃后，继续向哈尔科夫增派援军，试图巩固微小的战果，但现实很残酷，俄军难以维系这里的战斗。\n\n据《福布斯》报导，俄军曾试图占领沃夫昌斯克，但经过一番苦战后，大约有3万名俄军被困在这里，报导称，俄军估计已经失去了一个整旅的力量。\n\n另外，乌军还在沃夫昌斯克击败了俄军的精锐第83空降旅，值得注意的是，这里的许多俄军士兵拒绝继续战斗。此外还有一个战果，那就是自俄乌全面开战以来，如果加上最新击落的一架Su-25,乌克兰击落的俄罗斯各类战机和直升机数量加起来达到了惊人的686架之多。\n\n最新的地理位置录像显示，乌克兰军队正在沿着赫罗伊夫·霍尔诺比利亚大街前进。俄罗斯媒体声称，俄军第83旅的残余部队正在逃离。现在就看乌军第82旅能不能把他们拦截了。\n\n扎波罗热地区，29日，距离前线50公里处，一枚伊斯坎德尔-M导弹击中了当地的一列乌军纵队。乌军这次损失不小。俄罗斯消息来源声称，他们摧毁了乌军的M113、BUK-M1、BMP-1和卡车。目前尚不清楚俄军使用什么系统进行的攻击。\n\n阿夫迪夫卡前线，俄罗斯几乎控制了整个索基尔（Sokil），并且继续沿新奥列克桑德里夫卡-索基尔-乌曼斯克推进，试图拉平战线，但速度不如今年早些时候。\n\n6月30日，乌克兰发布数据，俄军人员、装备损失继续走高，但相比之前的强度有所下降。\n\n外界还关注到，最近半年，由于缺乏防空导弹，乌克兰人被迫采用各种方式保卫天空，启用并改进40年前的螺旋桨老飞机Yak-52就是一个很好的例子，这款飞机最近还有所斩获。\n\n6月29日，网传一架Yak-52飞机在空中和一架俄罗斯侦察无人机对峙，最后近距离用霰弹枪将无人机击落。虽然螺旋桨飞机的速度不如喷气式飞机，但比无人机快，所以Yak-52能追上这架俄罗斯Zala无人机。\n\nF-16或已首战乌克兰 何时能完全掌握制空权？\n\n6月29日，乌克兰前空军飞行员兼防空顾问泽维尔·泰特曼在社交媒体上宣布，与国际军团确认消息，首批F-16战机已经抵达乌克兰并进行了首次攻击。\n\n丹麦皇家空军司令扬达姆少将近日也表示，向乌克兰交付F-16战斗机的计划预计将如期完成。不过他强调：出于行动安全的考虑，不能透露具体的日期。但希望能按计划交付。当战斗机在乌克兰准备就绪时，会通知大家。\n\n此前，丹麦、比利时、挪威和荷兰都表示，将在6月或夏季向乌克兰交付F-16。鉴于最近克里米亚的俄罗斯防空系统，包括S-500系统，接连被摧毁，以及俄罗斯本土别尔哥罗德州频繁遭到乌军使用美制精确制导炸弹的轰炸，外界认为，或许有理由相信F-16已经投入战斗。\n\n当然，乌克兰接收的首批F-16战机数量不会太多，预计为4至6架，这与乌克兰的后勤维护能力有关系。\n\n由于这场战争实际上是整个西方与俄罗斯的对抗，虽然俄罗斯的武器性能并不像其公布的数据那样强大，但因为核武器的存在，西方在援助乌克兰时一直设有自我约束的红线。因此，西方援助的F-16数量确实有限，只能逐步改善乌克兰的防空能力。\n\n许多人设想，F-16一到战场形势就会立刻改变，这样的情况可能并不会出现，因为乌克兰接收的首批F-16数量不足以形成压倒性的军事优势。\n\n扬达姆少将还表示，即使乌克兰得到了F-16战斗机，仍无法完全控制自己的领空。他指出：\"乌克兰要获得制空权，还有许多工作要做。他们需要更有效的空军和地面防空力量。\"\n\n也就是说，虽然F-16能够帮助乌克兰赢得部分制空权，并拦截俄罗斯的导弹和无人机，但乌克兰仍需进一步清除俄军的防空系统，并利用爱国者等防空系统保护F-16的驻扎基地。目前，乌克兰正通过海马斯发射ATACMS导弹来进行这类工作。\n\n估计收到F-16后，乌克兰会先尽量清理前线和克里米亚的防空系统，通过远距离发射精确滑翔制导炸弹，并使用空空导弹拦截俄军导弹。\n\n此外，目前，飞行员数量有限且培训进度较慢，也是乌克兰要面对的挑战。还有地勤人员的短缺同样是个问题，却鲜为人知。实际上，培训成熟且有经验的地勤人员所需的时间远比飞行员要长。当然也不排除西方可能会提供相应的支持服务来弥补这一短板。\n\n有分析认为，首批驾驶乌克兰F-16战机的飞行员可能不是西方培训的乌克兰飞行员，很可能是国际军团中的F-16飞行员。此前就有不少前美国F-16飞行员表示，愿意为乌克兰驾驶F-16参战。\n\n关于F-16的防御能力，扬达姆少将表示：\"如果F-16被击落，对俄罗斯来说将是巨大的战略胜利。我们正在尽最大努力确保乌克兰飞行员熟练操作F-16，以将风险降到最低。但我不能保证任何事情。当然，如果其中一些被击落，我会感到非常遗憾。\"\n\n确实，任何武器一旦上战场，包括F-35在内，都有被击落的风险，更何况是F-16。当前乌克兰只能通过前期工作，降低F-16被击落的风险。\n\n更为关键的是，F-16只是一个作战平台，其威力取决于拜登政府为乌克兰的F-16提供的武器配置。此外，F-16要真正发挥巨大威力，还需要瑞典提供的预警机到位。\n\nF-16战机虽然不是万能的，但对局势发展起着至关重要的作用。F-16战机配合爱国者防空系统，将有效改变俄军投掷FAB炸弹的局面。如果确认F-16战机参加首次战斗，将进一步加深人们对目前局势有利于乌克兰的印象。\n\n更多俄高级官员被通缉 以色列要援8套爱国者\n\n最新的消息显示，英国《金融时报》援引消息称，美国、以色列和乌克兰正在讨论，以色列计划向乌克兰提供多达8套爱国者防空系统，以帮助其抵御俄罗斯的进攻。这一援助需要拜登政府的支持或者向以色列提供相当的军事援助来进行交换。\n\n这些在海湾战争期间部署的M901 PAC-2系统比乌克兰目前使用的爱国者PAC-3老旧，不过，PAC-2的优势在于射程更远，就像乌克兰的S-200之于S-300一样，对发射滑翔制导炸弹的俄军苏-34威胁更大。最重要的是，这些爱国者可以发射目前美国提供给乌克兰的那些拦截导弹。\n\n俄罗斯的麻烦还不止于此，海牙国际刑事法院上周已经发出了逮捕令，针对俄罗斯前国防部长谢尔盖·绍伊古和俄罗斯陆军总司令瓦列里·格拉西莫夫，指控他们在入侵乌克兰期间犯下战争罪和反人类罪。这两位高级官员被指控参与了包括轰炸乌克兰民用能源基础设施在内的多项罪行。此举标志着国际刑事法院对俄罗斯高级官员的进一步法律追责，包括与俄罗斯总统普京一起领导入侵行动的其他关键人物。尽管俄罗斯不是国际刑事法院的成员国，但这些指控可能会在国际社会引起强烈反响，包括对被指控人员的国际旅行限制和其他制裁措施。\n\n好的，今天的新冷战情室就到这儿了，关注我们，聚焦战场动态，剖析地缘争端，精彩尽在新冷战情室！\n\n=====================\n\n大家好，我是《新冷战情室》主持人。\n\n喜欢我们的频道，欢迎点赞，订阅，评论，并开启小铃铛🔔就可在第一时间观看精彩内容哦〜\n\n●干净世界《新冷战情室》订阅频道\n\nhttps://www.ganjing.com/zh-TW/channel/1f0pfr9iea8dLmIA3dw0Nuyyd12m0c\n\n●《新冷战情室》订阅频道\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkCfjd8aOsJHdpgj6FD9L1w (文章仅代表作者个人立场和观点)\n\n焦点\"乌克兰危机\n\n来源:新冷战情室 --版权所有，任何形式转载需看中国授权许可。严禁建立镜像网站.\n\n本文短网址：\n\n相似文章： 換一批\n\n換一批\n\n读者推荐： 換一批\n\n換一批\n\n读者喜欢： 換一批\n\n換一批\n\n1\n\n新一期特刊已经发表\n\n请荣誉会员登陆下载\n\n会员\n\n1\n\n新一期特刊已经发表\n\n请荣誉会员登陆下载\n\n【诚征荣誉会员】溪流能够汇成大海，小善可以成就大爱。我们向全球华人诚意征集万名荣誉会员：每位荣誉会员每年只需支付一份订阅费用，成为《看中国》网站的荣誉会员，就可以助力我们突破审查与封锁，向至少10000位中国大陆同胞奉上独立真实的关键资讯，在危难时刻向他们发出预警，救他们于大瘟疫与其它社会危难之中。\n\n欢迎给您喜欢的作者捐助。您的爱心鼓励就是对我们媒体的耕耘。\n\n来源:新冷战情室\n\n关键字搜索： 俄乌战争 普京 俄军 乌军 俄罗斯 乌克兰",

        "summary": "On July 1, 2024, the Russia-Ukraine war reached its 859th day. Ukraine launched missile and drone attacks on Crimea and several Russian regions, with Russia claiming to have shot down 36 Ukrainian drones. Ukraine's counteroffensive efforts have trapped approximately 30,000 Russian troops in Vovchansk, with significant Russian equipment losses reported. Ukrainian forces also defeated Russia's elite 83rd Airborne Brigade.\n\nUkraine has reportedly received its first F-16 fighter jets, which have begun operations, although the number is limited. The F-16s are expected to improve Ukraine's air defense but not immediately change the war's dynamics. Israel is considering providing Ukraine with eight Patriot missile systems, pending U.S. approval. Additionally, the International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Russian officials, including former Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, for war crimes. These developments indicate increasing international support for Ukraine and mounting pressure on Russia."

        "title": "赛轮集团跻身2024全球轮胎20强",
        "body": "导读：《Tyrepress》根据各企业2023年销售额发布最新全球轮胎20强榜单。\n\n近日，英国媒体《Tyrepress》根据各企业2023年的销售额，发布了最新的全球轮胎20强榜单。2023年，国外轮胎市场受供应链挑战、通货膨胀、地缘局势紧张等多重因素影响，轮胎行业发展受阻。然而，国内轮胎市场却呈现出截然不同的景象，受市场需求恢复性提升、中国新能源汽车快速增长以及出口市场火爆等多重利好因素的推动，轮胎厂商过去一年的经营状况普遍利好。接下来，我们将一起探讨过去一年中，全球轮胎20强的排名发生了哪些变化。\n\n在最新榜单中，全球轮胎第一梯队的米其林、普利司通、固特异、大陆集团依然稳居前列，排名没有发生变化。第二梯队中，倍耐力成功取代住友橡胶，成为全球第五；韩泰、优科豪马的排名同样保持稳定。而在第三梯队中，中策橡胶依然位居全球第9；尤为引人注目的是，赛轮集团排名连升2位，成功取代东洋轮胎，首次跻身全球前十。\n\n赛轮集团的飞速发展得益于其前瞻性的战略布局和全球化经营策略。据数据显示，赛轮集团2023年全年营业收入约259.78亿元，同比增加18.61%，是榜单中增速最快的企业之一。今年一季度，赛轮集团继续保持高速增长态势，实现营业收入72.96亿元，同比增长35.84%。\n\n赛轮集团的全球化布局是其快速发展的重要支撑。近年来，赛轮轮胎加速\"出海\"，不断拓展国际市场。其在越南、柬埔寨、墨西哥等地的投资项目相继落地，进一步提升了公司的全球产能和市场占有率。特别是今年，赛轮集团的投资动作频繁，拟在印尼建设年产300万条半钢子午线轮胎、60万条全钢子午线轮胎及3.7万吨非公路轮胎项目，并与墨西哥Tire Direct合资建设年产600万条半钢子午线轮胎项目，标志着公司在北美市场的布局迈出了坚实的一步。\n\n赛轮集团的成功不仅在于其全球化布局，更在于其持续的技术创新和市场拓展。公司注重产品研发和品质提升，不断推出符合市场需求的高性能轮胎产品。同时，赛轮集团积极开拓国内外市场，与多家知名车企建立合作关系，进一步提升了品牌影响力和市场竞争力。在新能源汽车领域，赛轮集团也展现出了强大的实力，成功推出了多款新能源汽车专用轮胎产品，赢得了市场的广泛认可。\n\n米其林和普利司通：全球轮胎霸主\n\n在全球轮胎市场中，米其林和普利司通无疑是霸主地位，只有这两家企业的销售额超过200亿欧元。固特异和马牌紧跟其后，销售额也远超100亿欧元。\n\n在前十名中，销售额差距最小的是倍耐力、住友和韩泰。这三家企业2023年的销售额分别增长了0.5%、7.1%和6.5%。尽管住友橡胶的销售额增速高于倍耐力，但由于日元贬值等因素的影响，其排名却被倍耐力反超。\n\n值得一提的是，优科豪马在去年5月成功收购了特瑞堡，然而合并业绩尚未完全体现。该公司曾预计，收购后每年可为公司带来约10亿欧元的销售额，或将在明年带动其排名上升。\n\n11-20强：排名翻天覆地\n\n相较于十强排名的稳定，11-20强的排名变化可谓翻天覆地。其中，诺记轮胎因俄乌战争等因素经营每况愈下，最终跌出榜单，取而代之的是印度JK轮胎。\n\n东洋和正新轮胎的排名也各下降一位，这两家企业经营虽较为稳定，但面对赛轮等企业的快速发展，其竞争压力也显而易见。\n\n锦湖轮胎则表现亮眼，排名超过佳通，位居全球第14。佳通也是整个榜单中，排名下滑最多的企业，尽管只下滑了2位。2023年锦湖营收突破4万亿韩元，同比增长13.5%；营业利润更是大幅增长了1677%，创下历史新高。今年一季度，锦湖轮胎的销售额也进一步提升。5月，锦湖还发布了新能源汽车专用的EnnoV系列轮胎，旨在进一步扩大公司竞争力。锦湖能否重返全球排名前十的巅峰？让我们拭目以待。\n\n耐克森的全球排名也提升了2位，欧洲市场的强劲表现带动了公司业绩的稳步提升。随着捷克工厂二期扩建工程的完成，并于2024年开始生产，耐克森预计到2025年，捷克的年产能将达到1100万条轮胎，总产能将达到每年5200万条。\n\n美国泰坦国际的排名虽有下滑，但该公司于今年宣布以2.96亿美元的现金和股票，收购美国知名特种轮胎制造商Carlstar Group LLC。这一收购预计将带动泰坦的业绩增长。\n\n综合来看，榜单中第11位和第20位的销售额差距仅有16亿欧元左右，这表明在这一区间内的企业竞争更为激烈，排名也更容易出现变化。\n\n2024年，在地缘政治局势紧张、通货膨胀加剧等多重因素影响下，欧美轮胎行业迎来了减产、裁员、关厂潮。与此同时，全球轮胎市场的供需关系也在飞速变化，中国轮胎企业加速出海，以性价比优势开启\"全球替代\"的新篇章。\n\n固特异今年一季度销售额下降了8.2%，净亏损5700万美元，已连续亏损6个季度。面对困境，公司进行了一系列大刀阔斧的改革措施，包括关闭多家工厂和出售部分资产。\n\n诺记轮胎也面临困境，今年一季度净亏损2620万欧元，相比去年一季度亏损额进一步扩大。红海危机和芬兰的罢工导致生产损失、运输延误和物流费用上涨，严重影响了公司利润。为了应对困境，诺记轮胎不得不采取暂时解雇员工等紧急措施。\n\n普利司通也宣布了解雇其美国得梅因工厂100多名员工的决定，理由是\"农业轮胎行业的需求限制\"。这是该工厂自1990年以来的首次裁员。此外，普利司通还关闭了在中国沈阳的卡客车轮胎工厂，以进一步优化成本结构和业务模式。\n\n米其林今年一季度的销售额也下降了2.7%，轮胎总销量下降了4.1%。为了应对市场变化，米其林计划将中国沈阳工厂和波兰Olsztyn工厂转为乘用车轮胎生产，并关闭中国上海工厂的金属骨架材料业务。这些调整将导致米其林在全球的卡车轮胎产能减少15%。\n\n住友橡胶的土耳其工厂也因劳资纠纷问题而发生了罢工活动。罢工期间，工厂预计减产约16万条轮胎，这对住友橡胶的生产和供应链无疑是一次严峻的考验。\n\n反观国内轮胎市场，却呈现出截然不同的景象。从A股各家轮胎公布的业绩来看，中国轮胎企业的盈利能力和规模实力进一步扩大。各种扩产、技改、新建项目纷纷上马，展现出中国轮胎行业的蓬勃生机。\n\n2024年5月份，中国国内生产的橡胶轮胎外胎数量为9340.0万条，同比增长了9.5%，环比4月上涨了4.4%。1月至5月期间，中国累计生产的橡胶轮胎外胎数量达到43212.9万条，同比增长了11.1%。这些数据充分证明了中国轮胎市场的强劲增长势头。\n\n在出口方面，2024年前5个月中国橡胶轮胎出口量达363万吨，同比增长4.6%；出口金额为642亿元，同比增长6.1%。这些数据表明中国轮胎在国际市场上的竞争力正在不断增强。\n\n然而，我们也需警惕当前国内轮胎市场两极分化越来越严重的问题。虽然半钢胎市场在海内外消费降级及中国汽车销量的带动下越来越春风得意，但全钢胎市场受到全球及国内基建工程的放缓而需求收缩。面对这一挑战，中国轮胎企业需要继续加强技术创新和市场拓展，提升产品品质和品牌影响力，以在全球轮胎市场的竞争中保持领先地位。",

In 2023, Sailun's revenue increased by 18.61% to approximately 25.978 billion yuan. The company has been expanding its international presence with investments in Vietnam, Cambodia, Mexico, and plans for new projects in Indonesia and North America.\n\nOther notable changes include:\n- Nokian Tyres dropped out of the top 20 due to the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war.\n- Kumho Tires rose to 14th place, while Giti Tire saw the largest drop, falling two positions.\n- Nexen Tire improved its ranking due to strong performance in the European market.\n\nThe global tire market is experiencing significant shifts, with Chinese companies gaining ground through competitive pricing and increased production capacity. Meanwhile, Western companies like Goodyear and Nokian are facing financial difficulties, leading to factory closures and layoffs. The Chinese tire industry continues to grow robustly, with increased production and exports, although it faces challenges such as market polarization and the need for ongoing innovation."

2024年乌尔苏拉·冯德莱恩连任欧盟委员会主席之路并非一帆风顺。今年欧洲议会选举中，传统三大党团欧洲人民党、社会党和复兴欧洲党席位减少但仍占多数，维持主流党团地位。与此同时，极右翼党团在法国、德国、意大利取得显著进展，影响力增强。冯德莱恩为顺利连任对右翼的示好，导致社会党不满，引发了内部谈判困难。\n\n2. 其他的欧盟领导人如意大利总理梅洛尼、波兰总理图斯克都希望参与欧盟职位分配，以确保自身阵营在新一届欧盟权力中枢中获得话语权，增加了冯德莱恩的压力。平衡内部矛盾势必成为冯德莱恩未来在任期间绕不开的问题。\n\n3. \"稳中向右、更加保守\"已成为欧洲政坛发展的趋势。尽管在反移民政策，右翼阵营与主流党团态度一致强硬，但在经济财政、气候政策、俄乌冲突、欧盟扩军等问题上双方有所不同。至于中欧关系上，欧盟对华经贸政策将更为保守，而极右翼人物在处理对俄或对华关系时将更加实用主义，不那么基于意识形态。\n\n文丨 国际政治专栏作家、中国翻译协会会员 胡毓堃\n\n▎

未来的欧盟要想团结一致应对地区安全等内外挑战，冯德莱恩的压力有增无减。\n\n若要理解冯德莱恩寻求欧盟掌门人何以出现悬念，首先要知道刚刚结束的欧洲议会大选（选出全部720个议席）及各大政党党团席位版图：\n\n欧洲人民党 党团 （189席，增加2席），欧盟历史最悠久、1999年至今第一大党团，汇聚了欧盟多国中右翼、自由保守主义、基督教保守派主要政党，立场亲欧；欧委会主席冯德莱恩、波兰总理图斯克、希腊总理米佐塔基斯等政要均属于这一党团；\n\n社会党 党团（136席，减少12席），欧洲历史第二悠久、欧洲议会第二大党团，成员为欧盟多国中左翼、社民主义主要政党，立场亲欧；德国总理朔尔茨、西班牙首相桑切斯、葡萄牙前总理科斯塔等欧盟国家领导人来自这一阵营；\n\n复兴欧洲 党团（74席，减少23席），欧洲中间自由派党团，持亲欧主义立场；法国总统马克龙、欧洲理事会主席米歇尔、荷兰首相吕特、爱沙尼亚总理卡娅·卡拉斯等欧洲领导人属于该党团；\n\n（由于都秉持中间、亲欧主义意识形态，并占据了欧洲议会过半多数席位，欧洲人民党、社会党、复兴欧洲被视为欧洲议会\"老三大\"和稳定格局的基石）\n\n保守与改革党团 （83席，增加21席），本次欧洲议会选举最大赢家，涵盖右翼到极右翼政党，持民族保守主义和自由保守主义意识形态，立场为温和疑欧主义（不反对欧盟的存在，但反对欧盟侵蚀各国独立主权）；意大利总理梅洛尼来自该党团；\n\n此外，进入本届欧洲议会的还有极右翼的认同与民主党团（成员包括另一大赢家 -- -- 勒庞领导的法国国民联盟），左翼的绿党/欧洲自由联盟党团、欧洲议会左翼党团，以及没有加入任何党团的无所属议员（包括极右翼德国选择党、匈牙利右翼总理欧尔班及其领导的青民盟）。\n\n▎ 欧洲议会选举结果统计。图源： POLITICO\n\n概括而言，选后欧洲议会形成的政治格局具有以下特点：\n\n就单纯的议席数量来说，\"老三大\"欧洲人民党、社会党、复兴欧洲的版图虽然再度缩水，但至少守住了欧洲议会的绝对多数（尽管欧洲人民党和社会党连续两届无法通过两方合作实现\"多数共治\"），维系了传统主流党团的统治地位而不至于\"变天\"；\n\n就成员国情况分析，极右翼党团的崛起不是体现在议席总数显著增加，而是在欧盟核心三大国法国、德国、意大利\"质的飞跃\" -- -- 德国选择党跃升第二、超越执政联盟\"红绿灯\"三党，勒庞的法国国民联盟和梅洛尼的意大利兄弟党更是成为本国在欧洲议会第一大党。\n\n凭借总体多数，欧盟现行建制派领导人连任自然是最具可行性的选择；可极右翼占据欧盟核心国家的主流中央舞台，又决定了冯德莱恩们不能不要其支持。 这便是欧盟领导人选悬念的背景源头。\n\n由此看来，冯德莱恩要想连任且不被极右翼势力绑架，只需要一如既往由\"老三大\"谈判达成一致，便可推出欧盟领导层候选人 ，并在欧洲议会顺利通过任命。 尤其是2014年开始沿用的\"领衔候选人\"制度下，最大党团欧洲人民党可直接提名冯德莱恩为欧委会主席，连任阻碍更小。\n\n▎ \"领衔候选人\"制度即欧盟委员会主席职位将由议会选举中得票率最高的政党担任。\n\n当然，既然要三大党团合作，那么欧盟领导职位安排离不开兼顾平衡。 以选前欧盟三大机构为例，欧洲理事会（相当于欧盟\"集体元首\"）主席为复兴欧洲的米歇尔（比利时），欧盟委员会主席（相当于\"欧盟总理\"）为欧洲人民党的冯德莱恩（德国），欧洲议会议长为欧洲人民党的梅措拉（马耳他）。\n\n重要性不亚于三大机构一把手的欧盟外交与安全政策高级代表（\"欧盟外长\"，自动兼任欧委会副主席、欧盟外交事务委员会主席），则由社会党的博雷利（西班牙）出任。\n\n基于党团、国家、地域甚至性别平衡的类似逻辑， 此次提名的新一届领导集体做出了如下安排：社会党的葡萄牙前总理科斯塔担任欧洲理事会主席，欧洲人民党的冯德莱恩和梅措拉分别连任欧委会主席和欧洲议会议长；而\"欧盟外长\"的职务，则提名东欧国家、\"抗俄前线\"的爱沙尼亚总理卡娅·卡拉斯（复兴欧洲）。\n\n按理说，如此安排既确保了中右翼阵营的主导地位、兼顾了三大党团、排除了极右翼势力，还在俄乌冲突的大背景下以卡拉斯的任命表明欧盟外交的主要关切。更不用说冯德莱恩与科斯塔关系甚好，领导集体的延续性、稳定性和团结程度必强于上一届。\n\n▎ 6月17日欧盟领导人就最高职位候选人的谈判破裂，无果而终。图源：美联社\n\n然而令人惊讶的是，就是这样一份理想名单，在6月17日的欧盟领导人非正式峰会上功亏一篑、未能通过。究其原因，不是因为外部阵营的干扰，而是因为欧洲人民党\"贪婪和傲慢的行为\"，差点毁了原本主动的\"大好形势\"。\n\n或许因为是\"老三大\"中唯一在欧洲议会扩大议席版图的党团，欧洲人民党觉得自己有更多谈判资本，比五年前提出了更多要求 ：不仅要在四大领导职位中延续已有的两大要职，还要和社会党平分\"元首\"职务任期 -- -- 不同于欧委会主席（五年），欧洲理事会主席任期为2.5年，但按照惯例会让同一党团人员连任、履职五年。\n\n这就是说，欧洲人民党要在四个大位中占据2.5个，反过来作为议会第二大党团，社会党在欧盟领导层的席位甚至还不如复兴欧洲（选举最大输家）。是可忍孰不可忍，社会党再怎么说也有德国、西班牙两个欧盟大国领导人坐镇，当然不会退让。\n\n此外，出于对选票支持率不够的担忧，冯德莱恩在大选前向右翼的保守与改革党团示好，本就令社会党相当不满。 现在需要拉拢社会党阵营，却拿不出分享权力的诚意，结果便是双方无法在6月17日晚上达成一致。\n\n值得注意的是，一位欧盟官员在批评欧洲人民党\"傲慢狂妄\"时，还直言在任欧洲理事会主席米歇尔没有为促成协议做出任何努力，而是\"不断地提出其他事宜\"。 这些年米歇尔与冯德莱恩关系紧张乃众所周知，二人多次在不同场合\"互相拆台\"。看着冯德莱恩\"玩脱了\"，米歇尔只会找机会\"使绊子\"，甚至把前者\"拉下马\"。\n\n堡垒容易从内部攻破，再加上其他诸侯的争夺，便会让相对简单的问题复杂化。 尽管\"欧盟掌门\"的名分归属是大家的共识，但权力资源的争夺要远远复杂得多。为了实现各自的争权目的，借欧盟领导人任命一事发难，不失为一种手段。\n\n今年最大的挑战者、意大利极右翼总理梅洛尼便是典型代表。 作为今年欧洲议会选举唯一一位取得大胜的欧盟大国领导人，她上来就对其他欧盟领导人将自己排除在外、秘密\"内定\"欧盟领导集体。用她的话说，欧盟领导人开会应该先讨论如何面对欧洲议会选举结果体现的新信号，然后由此讨论职务分配，而不是颠倒顺序。\n\n此话言外之意足够明显：安排新一届欧盟权力中枢，得让她所属的右翼阵营（保守与改革党团）分享胜利果实。\n\n事实上，梅洛尼本人还未开口，外界传言已经满天飞：她想安插意大利欧洲事务部长拉法埃莱·菲托担任欧委会（执行）副主席，力推资深外交官、意大利信息安全局局长伊丽莎白·贝洛尼负责欧盟的防务与外交事务......\n\n梅洛尼本人不会与冯德莱恩争夺大位，其阵营成员进入欧盟领导集体同样不太现实（毕竟得确保东欧国家政要至少得到一个领导职务），但她想要掌握主导权或话语权的领域如今可谓\"世人皆知\" ：经济领域的货币、贸易或竞争专员，新设立的防务专员（意大利拥有全球前十、欧洲第四大国防产业，武器生产与贸易是该国工业界的重要生意）......\n\n诚然，就算冯德莱恩无视梅洛尼，也不阻碍她获得多数欧盟成员国的支持 -- -- 按照欧洲理事会的\"合格多数\"标准，55%以上（15个）成员国支持，且支持的国家人口占欧盟总人口65%即可，但意大利毕竟是G7国家、欧盟第三大经济体和老牌大国，无人敢想象新任欧委会主席在没有意大利总理支持的情况下就职。\n\n在\"老三大\"阵营内部，也有人不想让冯德莱恩轻松过关。 在东西欧摩擦不断的情况下，欧盟总是要考虑如何让东欧成员国满意。这一次，欧盟资深大佬、波兰总理图斯克（欧洲理事会和欧洲人民党双料前主席）便成了内部发难的带头人。\n\n在欧盟大环境下，波兰的实力本就是东欧国家领头羊，特别是俄乌冲突以来东欧国家的分量显著增长。图斯克是欧洲人民党内仅有的欧盟大国领导人，而且在欧洲议会选举中扩大了实力，显然自视有足够的\"讨价还价\"资本。\n\n不同于梅洛尼阵营，图斯克手下的波兰外长西科尔斯基对防务专员一职无甚兴趣，因为在他看来这个类似于\"国防工业协调员\"的职务并没有\"防长\"实权。相比之下，图斯克乃至东欧阵营更想要的，则是欧盟扩军、交通等专员职务：前者与东欧的地缘利益息息相关，后者直接影响东欧与其他欧盟国家的贸易体量。\n\n欧洲理事会卸任主席米歇尔看到冯德莱恩\"出师不利\"，也不忘试探将后者拉下马的机会。 欧洲媒体已经传出，米歇尔心中早有关于欧盟领导集体的另选方案，即由希腊总理米佐塔基斯当欧委会主席，丹麦首相弗雷泽里克森（社会党团）当欧洲理事会主席。\n\n无论如何，新一轮\"三方会谈\"结果显示，冯德莱恩在欧盟获得的连任支持足够稳妥： 代表欧洲人民党团的图斯克和米佐塔基斯，代表社会党团的朔尔茨和桑切斯，代表复兴欧洲的马克龙和吕特通过视频会议确认了对冯德莱恩及新一届领导集体人选的认可。\n\n▎ 2024年6月27日，欧盟领导人在布鲁塞尔举行的欧盟峰会上合影留念。图源：美联社\n\n简言之，经过一番\"讨价还价\"的努力，波兰、希腊、德国、西班牙、法国、荷兰六国领导人已经确定支持冯德莱恩（囊括了意大利之外的欧盟五大国）。 这为欧盟领导人第二次会议奠定了基础。\n\n要说可能的节外生枝，或许会是下个月中旬的欧洲议会投票环节 ：由于冯德莱恩此前的言行伤害了社会党人的感情，可能有10%的强硬社会党团议员拒绝投票支持她，彻底斩断其连任之路 -- -- 按照欧盟制度，候选人一旦未能在欧洲议会获得多数支持，将不会有第二次机会，而是另行提名其他人选走流程。\n\n排除这一极端情况，冯德莱恩顺利再任后，面对的将是与此前五年明显不同的政治版图。 右翼和极右翼政党议席扩大是肉眼可见的事实，欧洲议会各党团之间又是松散灵活的合作关系，右翼党团随时可以在特定议题上从\"老三大\"内部挖墙脚、拉拢政党议员。为了确保法案通过，主流的\"老三大\"势必不得不在某些方面迎合极右翼的诉求。\n\n▎ 欧盟的极右党派分布，统计时间截止于2024年5月23日。图源：POLITICO\n\n由此造成的结果，便是一个稳中向右、更加保守的欧洲政坛，乃至影响未来欧盟多项内外政策的方向：\n\n反移民 是碎片化的右翼阵营难得的最大共识，并已经影响到主流党团的移民问题态度（趋于强硬）。\n\n在经济与财政问题上， 右翼阵营更强调本国经济主权和利益至上，导致不同国家的右翼政党因国情和诉求不同，难以就欧盟的财政与债务应对政策达成共识（例如德国选择党强调财政纪律，而意大利兄弟党则需要放松限制、举债经营），直接威胁欧盟财政政策的稳定性。\n\n气候政策方面， 保守与改革党团强烈反对2040年碳减排90%的提议，要求为采矿活动\"松绑\"，不同意为了恢复自然生态而影响农业生产；由于右翼政党和左翼绿党此消彼长，环保事业走\"回头路\"的可能性在增大。\n\n对于俄乌冲突， 欧盟的主流声音无疑是援乌反俄 ，但战争久拖不决，以匈牙利总理欧尔班为代表的\"选举赢家\"将继续质疑制裁俄罗斯的有效性，这种质疑的声音随着右翼势力的扩大而得到更多响应，例如斯洛伐克总理菲佐、荷兰极右翼政客维尔德斯。\n\n欧盟扩军 这一长期工程也面临着更多不确定性，本来随着俄乌冲突发酵，乌克兰入盟一事被提上议程，但对此最不支持的匈牙利、斯洛伐克、法国、奥地利都见证了本国极右翼影响力做大、成为欧洲议会赢家；加上这些极右翼领导人相对\"友俄\"的态度，意味着欧盟很难期待在未来五年扩军、纳入乌克兰。\n\n至于始终敏感的中欧关系，则可能呈现多元复杂甚至看似矛盾的走向。一方面，基于\"去风险化\"、\"降低依赖\"、贸易保护主义的逻辑，欧盟在对华经贸政策上会有更多保守色彩。另一方面，极右翼人物更偏向持实用主义，处理对俄或对华关系时，不那么强烈地基于意识形态色彩。\n\n法国《世界报》指出，代表勒庞阵营的若尔丹·巴尔代拉唯一一次在欧洲议会投票针对中国，是因为他认为后者对欧洲关键基础设施建设的影响过大。至于欧盟建制派关注的所谓\"人权\"等议题，他从来不予介入，为此还招致《世界报》等欧洲主流媒体的批评。\n\n美国政治新闻网站Politico认为，面对俄乌战争的威胁和特朗普在美国卷土重来的可能，欧盟各国都希望保持领导集体和政策的稳定性。不过冯德莱恩连任背后的故事表明，如何平衡各路诸侯的胃口，维系必要的稳定性和团结，显然是比连任更难的使命。",

        "summary": "The article discusses the challenges faced by Ursula von der Leyen in her bid for re-election as President of the European Commission in 2024. Key points include:\n\n1. **Election Dynamics**: The 2024 European Parliament elections saw a reduction in seats for the traditional major parties (European People's Party, Socialists, and Renew Europe) but they still hold a majority. Meanwhile, far-right parties gained significant ground in France, Germany, and Italy, complicating von der Leyen's re-election efforts and causing internal negotiations to be difficult.\n\n2. **Internal EU Politics**: Leaders from Italy (Prime Minister Meloni) and Poland (Prime Minister Tusk) are vying for influence in the new EU leadership, adding pressure on von der Leyen. Balancing these internal conflicts will be a significant challenge during her potential second term.\n\n3. **Political Shifts**: The European political landscape is shifting towards the right, with increased conservatism. While there is consensus on anti-immigration policies, there are differences on economic, climate, and defense policies. The EU's approach to China and Russia is expected to be more pragmatic and less ideologically driven.\n\n4. **Leadership Negotiations**: Despite the rise of the far-right, von der Leyen's re-election is supported by major EU leaders. However, internal disputes, particularly within the European People's Party, have complicated the process. The final leadership arrangement includes key positions for different party groups to maintain balance.\n\n5. **Future Challenges**: If re-elected, von der Leyen will face a more divided and right-leaning European Parliament. Ensuring unity and addressing regional security challenges will be more difficult. The EU's policies on immigration, economy, climate, and defense will likely become more conservative.\n\nThe article highlights the complexities of EU politics and the delicate balance von der Leyen must maintain to secure her re-election and navigate the evolving political landscape."

The survey, conducted by Mono Research, included the top 1,000 companies in twelve key export industries. Notably, the shipbuilding, petrochemical, biopharmaceutical, automotive parts, and electrical electronics sectors are optimistic about export growth. Conversely, the steel and petroleum products sectors anticipate a decline.\n\nThe primary reasons for expected export growth include improved industry conditions and enhanced product competitiveness through new technologies. However, companies predicting a decrease cite rising commodity and oil prices and economic slowdowns in key markets like China.\n\nDespite the optimistic export outlook, 79% of respondents believe that profitability will either remain the same or worsen due to increased raw material costs, lower export prices, and higher import costs due to exchange rate fluctuations. Key risk factors include rising raw material prices, slow global demand recovery, and geopolitical conflicts.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, companies plan to cut costs, raise product prices, and diversify supply chains. They also suggest that the government should stabilize the foreign exchange market, provide tax support for raw material imports, expand corporate tax reductions, prevent logistics disruptions, and increase policy-based financial support. The average exchange rate needed to ensure export profitability is estimated at 1,332 KRW to 1 USD."

        "body": "几年后美国人会不会抱怨\"都怪俄乌战争\"？\n\n本周，美国两个重要的战略级项目传出坏消息，一个是\"哨兵\"洲际导弹项目负责人被解职，同时项目因超支受到国会严厉审查。另一个是美国空军对\"下一代绝对空优\"（NGAD）项目，也就是大家通常说的六代机项目的态度出现逆转，据称可能正在\"重新考虑\"项目前途。\n\n此外还有一个小小的附带消息，那就是美国批准了对台出售无人机，然而区区几百架小型无人机的售价竟达到几亿美元之巨，令人震惊。几年后美国人会不会抱怨\"都怪俄乌战争\"？\n\n综合上述信息，给人一种感觉，似乎美国的国防工业，尤其是新质战斗力、新技术发展领域出了大问题，那么我们该如何客观看待呢？本期军评咱们来盘一盘这几件事。\n\n\"哨兵\"洲际导弹是美国空军新一代陆基洲际导弹项目。尽管美国的核威慑自冷战结束后的大头就是\"俄亥俄\"级核潜艇上面的\"三叉戟\"导弹，但陆基导弹仍有着重要地位，陆基洲际导弹在核大战条件下承担的任务一是作为先发制人的打击手段，二是作为吸引敌人核攻击的\"诱饵\"。\n\n哨兵导弹到现在也只有这个图稍稍有点意义，就是它比\"民兵3\"要大，但是比\"和平卫士\"要小\n\n虽然地位重要，但冷战结束后，美国空军在陆基洲际导弹方面的投入并不多，马放南山了。\n\n迄今，这些导弹仍使用着上世纪70年代开发的机械式陀螺仪惯性导航组件。至于它们的指挥控制系统就更是老旧，一件被广为报道的事情是，其计算机系统直到几年前才换掉了5寸软盘，改成了现代的固态硬盘。\n\n在新一代LGM-35\"哨兵\"导弹 -- -- 此前叫GBSD（陆基战略威慑）项目的论证阶段，共和党强烈支持开发新导弹，民主党则不太喜欢，一直要求研究能否延寿民兵3对付过去算了。作为妥协，就是新的\"哨兵\"导弹要沿用民兵3的发射井，以降低成本，这才终于开始竞标。\n\n外界普遍认为，对于美国来说开发新型的陆基洲际导弹不会是难事。毕竟洛克希德·马丁公司的\"三叉戟\"海基导弹技术水平可以说达到世界洲际导弹领域的高峰，甚至海军已经规划将这种导弹延寿改装后装在新一代\"哥伦比亚\"级核潜艇上，要一直用到2084年。那把\"三叉戟\"相关技术拿来开发一个陆基版\"三叉戟\"，有什么困难吗？既然俄罗斯能把\"亚尔斯\"导弹直径改大，长度缩短，装进核潜艇里变成\"圆锤\"，对于美国来说，把三叉戟导弹直径改小，长度加大，塞进陆基发射井里，应该也没什么难的吧？\n\n也许技术上确实不是不行，但人家洛马压根不接这个茬，只表示作为子承包商可以承接部分子系统的研制生产。毕竟三叉戟人家吃的好好的，没必要再增加成本来搞GBSD。\n\n就这样一直拖到2020年，项目才算落实到了诺斯罗普·格鲁曼公司身上，波音公司在早项目竞标阶段就骂骂咧咧退出了。因为诺斯罗普收购了\"轨道ATK\"公司，这家公司同时也为波音提供大型固体火箭发动机。换言之，即使波音中标，他们也得求着诺格为他们开发火箭发动机。\n\n诺斯罗普已经开始进行LGM-35A导弹的部分测试工作，图为准备进行测试的第二级火箭发动机\n\n诺格虽然拿到了项目，但其推进速度还是大大落后，原因也很简单，就是他们已经很多年没有开发过这种高性能固体大火箭了。虽然三叉戟导弹的火箭推进器也是他们开发，但那也是好几十年前的事儿了。此间轨道ATK公司（如今是\"诺斯罗普·格鲁曼创新部门\"）干的最多的事情，是翻新老导弹以及在老导弹基础上改改凑个新火箭或导弹，比如用侏儒小型洲际导弹技术开发GBI反导拦截弹，但这种修修补补、排列组合与全新开发一种新导弹完全是两回事。\n\n经过几十年马放南山，结果那可不就是一切要从头开始吗？\n\n所以2023年，美国空军部长弗兰克·肯德尔就表示目前对于GBSD项目来说最难的是\"我们不知道我们不知道什么\"(unkown unkowns)，以及\"重新制定标准\"。\n\n而到了今年，又爆出新问题，即发现民兵3导弹的发射井就地作为新导弹的发射井还不行，那都是上世纪七十年代的发射井了，别的不说，光是老化问题就很头痛。\n\n目前提出的解决方案是发射井重新浇筑混凝土，重新布线 -- -- 其实就是就地重建；但就地重建还得算\"拆旧\"费，发射井这种连核弹攻击都能扛的东西，要\"拆旧\"的难度可不是开玩笑，也得花大钱。甚至据报道称，现在这个项目还涉及将当年老旧的连接各个发射井和控制系统的电缆换成光纤的问题，而这些深埋的电缆系统要挖出来重新铺光缆，涉及到征地，光这一项成本就非常惊人。\n\n里外里一算，所谓\"沿用\"老民兵的发射井最后比另择地点新建发射井贵多了。\n\n但也没办法，国会老爷说了要沿用老井就得沿用。前面说了，这是政治问题，已经没人管最初决定沿用老井是为了省钱......结果可不就是严重超支和项目拖延嘛！2015年糊弄国会老爷的时候说只要600亿美元，到了2024年的现在，已经上涨到1300亿美元。\n\n老发射井改造计划，白色部分是改建新增设施，灰色为沿用老井设施\n\n不过\"哨兵\"项目的反对声音很有意思，由几位参议员提出，他们要求对\"哨兵\"项目\"是否对美国国家安全至关重要\"进行\"公平、诚实的审查\" -- -- 其实看一下这几位仁兄的背景就会发现 -- -- 说白了这是波音公司和民主党的反攻倒算啊。\n\n因为\"民兵3\"导弹是波音的，如果取消\"哨兵\"项目，就只能选择\"民兵3\"再延寿；波音公司早在退出\"哨兵\"项目时就向国会提交了抗议，其中附上了民兵3延寿项目方案：陀螺仪换成三叉戟同款的激光陀螺仪，全弹电子系统全面更新，固体燃料挖掉重新浇注，发动机也换掉，增加射程，解决不能带3弹头覆盖中俄全境的问题。至于指挥控制系统的电缆就干脆摆烂，不换了，只换计算机，发射井也就不必重建了，修缮一下就行......你看我波音的B-52轰炸机，空军要用一百年，想来也不差这400多枚民兵3了吧？\n\n当初大家都觉得波音提出这个方案也就是挽尊，只要诺格这边哨兵导弹开发顺利，波音就不大可能真正获得逆袭的机会，但你看，给你机会你不中用啊！\n\n\"民兵3\"导弹过于老旧，在1998-2009年间不得不进行了翻新以确保能用到2030年，不过没做多少技术修改\n\n至于NGAD项目，前几年大家看美国人折腾的也很热闹，提出\"新世代百式战机\"计划，要开发一系列快速迭代的概念验证机来推进项目进展，并且还通过各种\"泄密\"渠道明里暗里宣称其中的一些概念验证机已经开始试飞，今天给你看个CG渲染图，明天给你一个PPT，后天在网上发个模糊照片，总之那叫一个热闹。\n\n但问题是NGAD项目的参与方不让人省心，目前的竞标方还是上面洲际导弹项目中提到的老面孔，洛克希德和波音......\n\n怎么说呢？垄断资本主义国家是这样的。\n\n最近美国空军部长肯德尔（对，还是他）在接受《航空周刊》杂志和\"防务一号\"网站等媒体采访的时候表示，\"虽说目前我们还没有作出决定，但是我们正在考虑做出一些十分艰难的选择\"。\n\n本来呢，按计划NGAD项目今年就要决定花落谁家，选哪家都不存在\"十分艰难\"的问题；这十分艰难的选择，无非是还有第三种选项，就是项目黄了。\n\n此前波音一直都非常热心推进NGAD项目，尤其是之前他们还和海军一起搞了FA-XX项目，后来海空军几经谈判才同意先集中力量搞NGAD，之后再说海军战斗机。\n\n据\"防务一号\"的报道称，目前对于NGAD项目，波音的问题在于，美国空军现在不大敢相信波音，毕竟现在美国空军最头疼的就是波音的问题，你客机名声扫地也就罢了，你F-15EX能交得出几架？KC-46加油机问题解决了吗？T-7教练机搞定了吗？\n\n反正按照美国空军官员的话来说：\"迄今为止，波音公司未能替换他们有史以来最糟糕的高级管理层，即使公司其实已经决定了必须换掉他们......\"\n\n这话听起来很搞笑，但这居然是事实......\n\n也就是说美国空军现在对于让波音干NGAD这件事是很不放心的。\n\n波音现在，总让人有些不放心\n\n波音你信不过，那洛克希德如何呢？\n\n\"洛克希德没兴趣\"......\n\n好吧，你是不是觉得这句话在关于哨兵的情况里听到过？\n\n\"因为洛克希德在F-35上投入了巨大的成本，所以每次和他们提起NGAD，洛马就告诉你他们的F-35 BLOCK 4会有多少新的强大功能\"......\n\n说真的，以前看历史书的时候，对于英国一战后的海军发展特别不能理解，你说你堂堂世界第一海军，怎么主力还是一大票第一次世界大战时期的老船呢？你的\"前卫\"级怎么还用那破14寸主炮呢？为什么航母还用双翼\"箭鱼\"呢？\n\n现在看来，美国空军遇到的问题和当年英国皇家海军还真的是......历史重演啊。\n\n洛克希德：\"F-35block4就是六代机\"\n\n所以就目前情况来看，NGAD项目可能会取消。至于为什么取消，美国空军可能会找个技术原因。毕竟人家已经开始找台阶下了。\n\n\"防务一号\"网站的报道是这样说的：\"前瞻国际\"公司的航空分析师表示，虽然现在讨论NGAD项目是否真的会取消还为时过早，但美国空军领导层最近的信号是一个突然的转变，原因可能是经费，也可能是技术，因为目前来看，很多新技术发展，比如最近的俄乌冲突，可能让美国重新考虑是否还需要一种有人战斗机，从最近俄乌战争来看，有很多新技术可能取代有人战斗机，比如CCA（就是忠诚僚机的新缩写）、B-21、以及新型的制导弹药。\"\n\n怎么说呢，这转折是不是太突兀了点？这也能赖俄乌战争？\n\n你想不到的俄乌战训：能对付小摩托就行了，要什么六代机？\n\n说到这儿我突然有种预感，几年后，等到对美国而言真正的重大军事失败降临的时候，他们或许会和这两年抱怨\"一切都赖治安战，都是治安战带偏了美军的发展方向\"一样，转而大谈\"一切都怪俄乌战争，俄罗斯和乌克兰两个菜鸡互啄带歪了美军发展方向！\"\n\n治安战也好，俄乌也好，说到底都是借口，事情的本质还是美国本身在技术和工业实力上相对其他国家绝对优势的衰落。\n\n当然，具体到NGAD和GBSD，我们还可以很明显的看到\"一切都是体制的错啊\"，\"太伟大了，哈耶克！\"\n\n无限制的\"自由竞争\"带来的结果就是垄断，其实上面战斗机和导弹开发中波音、洛马、诺斯罗普的摆烂现状简直都是从马列主义经典著作中直接搬出来的案例。这就是典型的利用垄断地位，不再追求产品技术上的改良，而是赤裸裸地使用老旧甚至不合格产品赚取超额利润。\n\n最近美国批准的对台军售无人机也是一个典型案例。\n\n目前，美国批准对台出售的无人机有两种，价格总计6.6亿美元。但美国人批准的这两种无人机机型及其价格让人十分无语。\n\n第一种无人机是在乌克兰被批评为\"电子垃圾\"的\"弹簧刀300\"，这种无人机大家早就耳熟能详了，小螺旋桨无人机，数据链控制，全重2.5公斤，能携带相当于一个手榴弹的载荷。\n\n这种电子垃圾要3.6万美元一发，你敢信？\n\n这玩意美国人提供给乌克兰700架，基本上是转眼没，也没什么值得一提的卓越战果。毕竟这玩意灵活性不如四轴FPV，战斗部也不比它大，价格据称6000美元一架，还有价值3万美元的控制系统，也远比乌克兰自己用民用四轴无人机手搓贵得多，那玩意最多几百美元，然后你这\"弹簧刀\"数量还很有限。目前俄乌冲突中双方基本上一天就有几百架无人机互相对轰，700枚是糊弄谁呢？\n\n没办法，\"弹簧刀\"无人机诞生于2010年，正好是当代无人机技术爆炸的前夜，典型的\"时代的眼泪\"。\n\n当时几千美元能把一个手榴弹用无人机发射出去10公里，还能做到类似FPV的第一人称控制，确实很厉害。但2024年，这玩意就是妥妥的\"电子垃圾\"了。\n\n而美国人居然还能用这玩意赚大钱，这是我们想到的。\n\n因为这次批准的对台出售的\"弹簧刀300\"总共720架无人机和101套控制系统，打包价6300万美元......按照上面提到的，6000美元一架无人机、3万美元一套控制系统的价格算一下，总共不到1000万美元的东西，现在要卖6300万。\n\n不过话说回来，我们之前就说过，美国对台出售武器，只要是价格在国际通常价格10倍以下，就算是良心价......哦，这么看来\"弹簧刀300\"的价格只翻了6倍，\"你人还怪好的咧\"。\n\n另一种无人机，是\"阿特斯600MV\"，291架，3亿美元，这才是真正的杀猪刀啊！\n\n这玩意一百万美元一发！更过分！\n\n这玩意看起来是个大号\"弹簧刀\"，却是2020年才开始测试的新一代产品，属于美国新一代战术侦察无人机，航程444千米，重量9-12公斤，续航4小时，能携带1-3公斤的光电载荷，当然如果少带光电载荷，就可以带个一两公斤的战斗部了。尺寸规格同航天科技的CH-901类似，技术上，这玩意确实是有点东西的，同样是电动无人机，在同等载荷和高度、速度下，其航程和留空时间可以达到CH-901的两倍。当然，造价就远不止两倍了。\n\n这个无人机是在\"空射无人机\"项目下开发出来的，因此在2020年进行了从UH-60、C-130、AC-130炮艇机、P-3巡逻机等机型上发射的试验，后来还从MQ-1C、XQ-58A等无人机上进行了发射试验。美军的设想是未来可以由作战飞机和无人机携带这种小型无人机进行大量投放，形成蜂群，进行战术侦察任务。\n\n虽然载荷小了点，但一定要说的话，这种不算光电载荷可能也就万把美元的无人机，拿去当巡飞弹，美国人也是能承受的。比如美国向乌克兰提供的阿特斯600，就是作为\"巡飞弹\"援助的。只不过和俄军使用的\"小摩托\"比较一下的话，弹头还是太小了点，而且美国人给的数量也不算多，在战场上没闹出什么动静来。\n\n当然对台湾来说，\"阿特斯\"600最大的威力是价格，300架3亿美元。9公斤的无人机售价达到近百万美元，比它理论价格翻了近百倍，这可比\"弹簧刀\"的售价黑太多了 -- -- 今日纽约金价7.485万美元/公斤，9公斤也才67.365万美元啊。真是高贵的美国武器，厉害厉害，为你鼓掌。\n\n以如此高昂的价格购买这些电子垃圾水平的无人机，台湾当局的脑子是进了水吗？恐怕除了其中必然会有的贪腐问题，更重要的是继续\"装样子\"吧，给那些\"台独\"分子提供吹牛的理由：\"美国无人机！在乌克兰炸烂了俄国坦克！厉害不厉害！\"。\n\n此前美国说要让台湾成为\"刺猬岛\"，台湾就买了400枚标枪，2000枚毒刺，后来又买400枚鱼叉，这些数量远远达不到\"刺猬\"水平。因为对于台湾这样一个未来将面临远超俄乌水平的高烈度军事行动的地区来说，几百枚，小几千枚导弹，都是完全不够用的，基本上也就是一天两天内就要打光的程度。\n\n所以台军现在的状态就是\"装死\"，反正美国人都摆烂了，台军装装死混过去也没问题嘛。假装重视美国的各种建议，花大价钱象征性买点破烂，美国人和台湾政客都高兴就完了。反正仗打起来之前，那些\"台独\"分子只要有点因头能自己嗨起来。\n\n说起来也挺没劲的，在技术优势破产后，美军正在一路\"滑坡\"，现在已经到了要把这些\"廉价\"无人机当灵丹妙药的程度了，还张嘴就说\"俄乌\"。前几年刚刚起步的几个\"面向同等战略对手\"的战略级项目都弄得一塌糊涂，只顾着乐呵呵地到处去卖\"天价廉价无人机\"......\n\n廉价无人机最大的威力就是廉价啊，只要很低的价格就能出几千几万，所以不怕损失，拿无人机当炮弹打就是了。但你把廉价无人机卖出天价，虽然从赚钱角度说确实是大赚特赚，但真\"当那一天来临\"的时候，代价或许就是美帝国信用的彻底破产，到底是赚是赔，现在美国人似乎也已经无力做出正常判断了。\n\n美国人真正要面对的问题难道不是\"同等战略对手\"的\"对等技术\"武装起来的真正高科技大军么？俄乌到底哪里可以和未来的海峡相提并论了？美军现在也只能继续滑坡，反正到时两手一拍：\"哎呀，都是乌克兰害了我们啊！\"\n\n其实前几年治安战的时候美军难道不知道治安战就是个坑，\"斯特瑞克\"旅根本应付不了俄罗斯坦克吗？当然人家是知道的，但是造斯特瑞克、造防雷车能赚钱啊，美国传统汽车产业的最后辉煌就是造这些防不了反坦克地雷的防雷车，至于从阿富汗撤军之后直接扔给巴基斯坦多少，你管呢。\n\n这几年念叨\"都是治安战害了美军\"，那过几年就得念叨\"都怪俄乌战争打的太拉了\"\n\n无人机的道理也是一样的，美军不知道小型无人机未来战场上必须靠茫茫多的数量吗？美军不知道陆基洲际导弹需要更新吗？美军不知道他们的F-35打不过歼-20吗？那恐怕你太小看美军了。问题是你大头兵的命重要，还是垄断资本家赚钱重要？事情就很容易解释了吧。\n\n对于台湾当局，到是无所谓了，毕竟连他们的最高级政治人物都已经纷纷开始安排后路，现在的军购也无非是最后捞一笔的狂欢了，所以价超黄金的廉价无人机，这算得了什么？\n\n说了这么多，美国军事力量就那么拉胯吗？美国军事工业就真的完蛋了吗？\n\n那还是得说瘦死的骆驼比马大的道理。苏联解体都四十年了，今天还能从故纸堆里时不时翻出一些高价值的东西来，美国难道比苏联还不如吗？这也是太不重视对手了。\n\n与其关心小型无人机，不如多想想怎么对付远程火箭炮，毕竟美国人自己的火箭炮好像挺好使的\n\n其实和相关行业的朋友聊天经常能听到很多\"强美\"故事，比如同样的炮弹，美国人的炮弹装药比我们多，反过来说它的制造工艺也会更复杂，造价更昂贵，最后每年产量还远不如我们，但这不改变它确实在技术上比我们先进。至于其他水声电子、航空发动机、先进材料技术、芯片等很多其他领域，美国积累的技术都是让我们非常眼红的。\n\n所以制造能力衰落和技术领先这事儿并不矛盾，可能听起来挺抽象的，但事实如此。\n\n最后的落点还是老话，虽然今天的强敌看起来已是日影西斜，还拿着我们明确已经知道没什么意思的俄乌\"战训\"当\"滑坡\"的\"理论依据\"，确实有其可笑之处；但我们还是要看到，即使在乌克兰战况发展到如今这种状况，美国在西太平洋地区仍保留了相当实力。尽管近期又出现了\"航母空窗\"，但终究不是常态。\n\n所以不论如何，我们还是做好充足准备，才能在那一天到来的时候，雷霆万钧，一击制敌，毕竟趋势归趋势，历史总是存在偶然因素的，战场打不赢，一切等于零啊。",

The NGAD project, initially promising, is now under reconsideration, possibly due to financial and technical challenges.\n\nAdditionally, the U.S. approved a multi-billion dollar sale of drones to Taiwan, raising eyebrows due to the high costs of relatively small and outdated drones. The article suggests that these issues reflect broader problems in the U.S. defense industry, including technological stagnation and monopolistic practices by major defense contractors like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman.\n\nThe article speculates that in the future, Americans might blame the Russia-Ukraine war for these defense issues, similar to how they previously blamed counterinsurgency wars for military shortcomings. The underlying problem, however, is seen as a decline in the U.S.'s technological and industrial superiority.\n\nThe article concludes by emphasizing the need for China to remain vigilant and prepared, despite the apparent decline in U.S. military capabilities, as the U.S. still retains significant power in the Pacific region."

The newly formed left-wing alliance \"New People's Front\" received 28.1%, and President Macron's centrist alliance \"Together\" garnered 20.3%, placing third.\n\nIf current trends continue in the final vote next Sunday, \"National Rally\" could secure 260-310 seats, \"New People's Front\" 115-145 seats, and \"Together\" 90-120 seats. Intense discussions are ongoing between \"New People's Front\" and \"Together\" on whether to withdraw to prevent a \"National Rally\" victory. If no consensus is reached, 28-year-old \"political prodigy\" Jordan Bardella of \"National Rally\" could become France's Prime Minister, significantly influencing domestic policies.\n\nThe voter turnout was 69.7%, the highest since 1986. Following the results, large-scale protests and riots erupted in Paris and other cities. Marine Le Pen had previously expressed confidence in winning a majority, stating that Bardella would become Prime Minister and control financial policies, potentially hindering Macron's ability to support Ukraine militarily.\n\n\"National Rally\" opposes illegal immigration and has a pro-Russia stance, with some members having Russian ties. Analysts worry that Bardella's potential premiership could complicate France's aid to Ukraine, although France's support has been more diplomatic than military compared to Germany.\n\nOverall, the election results indicate a significant shift to the right in France and potentially across the EU, raising concerns about future support for Ukraine."
