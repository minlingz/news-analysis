        "title": "Leaders of Russia and China meet at a Central Asian summit in a show of deepening cooperation",
        "body": "Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping met Wednesday for the second time in as many months as they visited Kazakhstan for a session of an international group founded to counter Western alliances.\n\nPutin and Xi last got together in May when the Kremlin leader visited Beijing to underscore their close partnership that opposes the U.S.-led democratic order and seeks to promote a more \"multipolar\" world.\n\nNow they'll be holding meetings amid the annual session of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization taking place Wednesday and Thursday in the Kazakh capital of Astana. A look at the summit:\n\nWhat is the Shanghai Cooperation Organization?\n\nThe Shanghai Cooperation Organization was established in 2001 by China and Russia to discuss security concerns in Central Asia and the wider region, Other members are Iran, India, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Observer states and dialogue partners include Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.\n\nWho's attending this year?\n\nBesides Putin and Xi, and summit host President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, other leaders there will be Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif of Pakistan, President Shavkat Mirziyoyev of Uzbekistan, President Emomali Rakhmon of Tajikistan, and President Sadyr Zhaparov of Kyrgyzstan. President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus will attend because his nation is becoming a full member.\n\nIran is still choosing a successor to President Ebrahim Raisi, killed in a helicopter crash in May, with a runoff election Friday, so acting President Mohammad Mokhbar will attend.\n\nOther guests of the SCO include President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan.\n\nAlso present will be U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, who is visiting Central Asia. Guterres wants \"to position the U.N. as an inclusive organization that's talking to all the big clubs,\" said Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.\n\nWhat SCO leaders won't be there?\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi of India is sending his foreign minister. Indian media reports speculated the recently reelected Modi was busy with the parliament session that began last week. He attended the recent Group of Seven summit in Italy, and some reports also speculated he wants to balance India's relationship with Russia and the West.\n\nWhat are their goals?\n\nPutin wants to show that Russia isn't isolated over Western sanctions from the invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nAn arrest warrant has been issued for him by the International Criminal Court for war crimes, accusing him of personal responsibility for abductions of children from Ukraine. Kazakhstan is not party to the Rome Statute and thus is not obliged to arrest him.\n\nFor Putin, the meeting is about \"prestige and the symbolic optics that he's not alone,\" Gabuev said.\n\nIndeed, the Russian leader on Wednesday had multiple meetings with other leaders on the sidelines of the summit, all diligently aired by Russian state TV.\n\nAt a meeting with Xi on Wednesday, Putin hailed the SCO as \"one of the key pillars of a fair, multipolar world order,\" and said ties between Moscow and Beijing are \"experiencing the best period in their history.\"\n\nBoth face soaring tensions with the West and have met about 40 times.\n\nTheir meeting in China in May underscored Beijing's diplomatic support for Moscow and how it's a top market for its oil and gas. Russia has relied on Beijing as a main source of high-tech imports to keep its military machine running.\n\nThe SCO helps China project its influence, especially across Central Asia and the Global South. Xi called for \"bridges of communication\" between countries last week and wants to further promote China as an alternative to the U.S. and its allies.\n\nErdogan also met with Putin, whose expected visits to Turkey haven't materialized. The leader of the NATO member has balanced relations with both Russia and Ukraine since the war began, frequently offering to serve as a mediator.\n\nFor host Kazakhstan and the other Central Asian nations, the meeting is a way to further their cooperation with bigger, more powerful neighbors. Kazakhstan, for instance, frequently engages with both neighboring Russia and China, while also pursuing links with the West, with visits this year from U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and British Foreign Secretary David Cameron.\n\nWhat will be discussed?\n\nCountering terrorism is a key focus. Russia had what it has called two terrorist attacks this year, with more 145 people killed by gunmen at a Moscow concert hall in March, and at least 21 people were killed in attacks on police and houses of worship in the southern republic of Dagestan in June. In the March violence, the U.S. warned Russian officials about the possibility of an attack -- information that was dismissed by Moscow.\n\nThe SCO is not a collective security or economic alliance, and there are \"significant security differences between its members,\" said Nigel Gould-Davies, a senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia with the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London and a former British ambassador to Belarus. The \"principal value\" of the organization lies in the optics of non-Western countries gathering together, he added.\n\nGabuev agreed, saying the SCO is a place for conversation rather than a platform where \"collective decisions are made, implemented and have an impact.\"\n\nThis year, close Moscow ally Belarus will become a full member of the organization, and its admission indicates how Russia wants to bolster blocs of non-Western countries. Gould-Davies said the SCO is raising its profile \"by growing its membership rather than by deepening its cooperation.\"\n\nAre there tensions within the SCO?\n\nPolitical differences among some of SCO members -- such as India and Pakistan over disputed Kashmir -- also make it difficult to reach collective agreement on some issues.\n\nChina has backed Moscow amid the fighting in Ukraine, but at a meeting of the SCO in 2022, Putin referred to Beijing's unspecified \"concerns\" over the conflict. India's Modi then called for an end to the fighting without voicing explicit disapproval of Moscow's action.\n\nThe Central Asian countries balance relations with Russia and China while also remaining on good terms with Western nations. None of the five former Soviet republics in Central Asia have publicly backed the war, although all abstained on a U.N. vote condemning it.\n\nGuterres may use the meeting to talk to Putin about how Russia is \"disrupting the coherence of the U.N.,\" Gabuev said. Russia has vetoed U.N. Security Council sanctions on monitoring North Korea and a vote on stopping an arms race in outer space.\n\nWith Guterres unlikely to visit Moscow, the Astana meeting is likely his best chance to speak to Putin, Gabuev added.\n\nWill Ukraine be discussed?\n\nNeither Ukraine nor any of its Western backers are attending, and major talks -- or breakthroughs -- on the war are not expected.\n\nBut because it's rare these days for any meeting to include the heads of Russia, China, Turkey and the U.N., the possibility of talks about the war might be raised, at least on the peripheries of the summit, probably behind closed doors.\n\nThere could be \"a lot of sideline discussions on Ukraine, as it is a big issue which concerns all of us,\" a senior Kazakh official told The Associated Press. The official was not authorized to talk publicly, and thus spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nGabuev said Putin will try to show there's a \"big club of countries\" that are \"ambivalent\" toward the war in Ukraine.",

        "body": "Dr Moshe Kantor's case clearly demonstrates a cleanup of the list is long overdue. Those who deserve sanctions should remain, while those who were caught up in the overly tenacious initial compilation should be removed, Eldad Beck writes.\n\nSince the very beginning of the Russia-Ukraine war in February 2022, the European Union has taken many measures and posed sanctions against Russia and those deemed to be \"supporting, financing or implementing actions\" in the war effort.\n\nUnfortunately, in a hurried approach, some of the bureaucrats who put together the list and the criteria for applying personal sanctions against hundreds of individuals took what now appears to be a scorched earth policy. On many occasions, they seemingly relied on simple Google searches and Russia's rich list, much of which would not have stood up in court.\n\nIn fact, in April, this was proven true.\n\nTwo individuals, Mikhail Fridman and Petr Aven, successfully proved before the European Court of Justice that the European Council had not presented enough evidence to establish that they met the necessary bar of being involved in efforts that \"undermine or threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine\".\n\nNow, another hearing on one of the most egregious cases to date could deal another blow to the sanctions regime.\n\nOn 19 June, the General Court, the Court of Justice of the European Union, held a hearing on the case of Dr Moshe Kantor, former President of the European Jewish Congress (EJC), who stepped back from his position following the Council's decision to include him on the list of individual sanctions in 2022.\n\nKantor is the only democratically elected leader of a European minority community who was included on the individual sanctions list. In his role as a Jewish leader, he met with many European heads of state, European decision-makers and opinion-shapers.\n\nFor his activities, the promotion of tolerance and fighting against xenophobia and antisemitism, Dr Kantor received, over the years, state honours from, amongst others, Poland, Ukraine, Italy, Romania, Belgium, Austria and France.\n\nIronically, French President Emmanuel Macron awarded Kantor with the title of Commandeur de la Légion d'Honneur only a few weeks before France voted, as a member of the EU Council, to sanction him because of Kantor's presumed economic ties with the Kremlin.\n\nDuring the hearing at the EU Court, Kantor's defence team stressed that the whole process against Kantor was born in sin and haste and created an \"exceptional situation\", in which Kantor is sanctioned despite the fact that he has been living for decades away from Russia, has dedicated his life for the fight against antisemitism, promoting tolerance and ensuring the security of Jewish communities in Europe.\n\nMoreover, insisted the defence, the sanctions were renewed time and time again since September 2022 with an \"incomprehensible insistence\" despite all evidence provided to the Council, showing that Kantor ceased all his business activities even before the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014.\n\nAfter the EU Council legal team made its case, clearly exasperated, one of the judges asked again for evidence for the \"mechanisms of benefit\" between Kantor and Russian President Vladimir Putin, a crucial element in the case for sanctions. The Council's lawyers responded that all the evidence had previously been presented and were unable or unwilling to add anything new.\n\nTo demonstrate another problematic part of the accusations against him, Kantor's legal team brought up the fact that the first official file against him stated that he had \"Jewish-Russian\" nationality, a highly problematic and discriminatory appellation used by the Nazis against Jews in the 20th century.\n\nKantor was the only person on the EU sanctions list whose religious affiliation was referred to. This \"mistake\" brought the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, to apologise to Kantor.\n\nA letter signed by Michel0s Head of Cabinet, Frederic Bernard, dated 27 July 2022, explains: \"We sincerely regret the error that has been made by the responsible service with regards to your nationality in the evidence pack and has been rectified. The correct version of the document is enclosed herewith.\"\n\nWhile this was the most controversial, it was not the only error in the case against Kantor.\n\nAccording to numerous articles and experts who have assessed the working files of some of those sanctioned, the evidence compiled was \"slipshod\", \"shaky\" and \"embarrassing\".\n\nThe document used as a basis to sanction Kantor in 2022 contains only 64 pages and includes just eight articles and websites, six of which are machine-translated versions of Russian-language originals. The bulk of the packet consists of screenshots of entire articles, with relevant passages highlighted in yellow.\n\nTwo of the articles, on the Russian web portal Rambler and outlet Vecherniy Murmansk, are labeled on the websites as an \"advertisement\" or \"paid advertisement\", a description that was not included in the evidence packet. It is unknown who paid for these advertisements.\n\nSome of these articles are what can only be described as \"fake news\" pieces, which antisemitically accused Kantor of using his position as a Jewish leader to distort the memory of the Holocaust and minimise antisemitism for personal gain.\n\nAccepting these types of articles at face value, knowing they are paid advertisements on sometimes obscure websites by unknown figures, can themselves be construed as antisemitic.\n\nThe file also mistakenly lists Kantor as a shareholder of Acron, a Russian-based mineral fertiliser producer, instead of as an ultimate beneficiary.\n\nOn the point of Kantor's relationship with Putin, he has not held any business position in Russia for 30 years and has devoted all of his time and efforts to leading the European Jewish community over the last 20 years. No other person on the list is comparable to him in these respects. All the other people listed as \"businesspersons\" have either business positions or capital holdings in Russia.\n\nThe Court has even annulled the Council's decision to retain a businessperson on the sanctions list who left his position a few months before the renewal, as was the case for Alexander Shulgin last September.\n\nAs Kantor's legal team made clear, contrary to many other individuals on the sanctions list, Kantor was never invited to the numerous business forum meetings organised by the Kremlin for leading businessmen in Russia.\n\nIn the hearing, Kantor's legal team asserted that the Council's supposed case is simply based on the idea that one cannot be wealthy and of Russian origin without being a \"leading\" businessperson involved in a sector providing a substantial source of revenue to Russia.\n\nKantor's lawyers spoke about a \"real blindness\" of the Council in front of facts and of \"impossible scenarios,\" accusing Kantor of minimising the dimension of antisemitism in Russia or disproportionally promoting Russia´s role during WWII for personal gains\n\nThe EU Council's legal team admitted several times that mistakes were made in the preparation of Kantor´s sanctions file regarding his nationality and the claim that he was a shareholder of the Acron group.\n\nThe question that requires answering is why Kantor was sanctioned in the first place and remains on the list.\n\nSome have argued that his tireless campaigns for the security of Jewish communities, against antisemitism, as well as fighting Holocaust distortion and denial over the last 20 years, have fueled resentment against Kantor, and some old and baseless allegations against him are now weaponised.\n\nThe jurist Regis Bismuth, professor at the Sciences Po Law School in Paris and Director of Studies of the French Branch of International Law Association (ILA) and an expert on EU sanctions sees a structural failure in the way the sanctions list was prepared, and in the case of Kantor in particular.\n\n\"I think that it is interesting to place this case in the larger background of how sanctions are adopted by the EU Council. In 2022, hundreds of people were listed on the EU restriction measures list. Of course, some of them are deeply connected with the Russian regime, but not all of them,\" Professor Bismuth said.\n\n\"The files on the first group of sanctioned individuals were completed in just a few days. We do not have information on how files justifying individual sanctions were made. We have to keep in mind that many people were put on the list very quickly and often on the basis of information gathered from newspapers, sometimes Russian publications that are not completely reliable, or from social media.\"\n\n\"With Dr Kantor, there is a clear manifest error of assessment. What is particularly shocking about the case of Dr Kantor is that the file is relatively empty, and he appears to have been listed on the basis of his alleged wealth\".\n\nRegardless of the motivations for placing and maintaining Kantor on the sanctions list, the public hearing at the General Court laid bare many problems of the individual sanctions regime.\n\nThat is why a cleanup of the list is long overdue. Those who deserve sanctions should remain, while those who were caught up in the overly tenacious initial compilation should be removed.\n\nThe EU sanctions regime has suffered some recent blows. Disassociating itself from those who clearly have no place on the list would be a good start in its reputational restoration.\n\nEldad Beck is an Israeli journalist.",

Their meeting in Astana, the capital of Central Asia's largest economy, took place on the eve of a regional summit of several countries with strained relations with the West, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO).\n\nThe SCO, which is composed mainly of countries led by autocrats, has established itself as one of the key pillars of a just multipolar world orderPutin said, while Iran, under Western sanctions, joined the organization last year and Belarus will become a member on Thursday. The SCO, which currently has nine member countries (China, India, Iran, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Tajikistan), is conceived as a platform for cooperation competing with Western organizations, supposed to contribute to the advent of a world multipolara recurring term in the mouths of Russian and Chinese leaders. The SCO boasts of bringing together 40% of the world's population and about 30% of global GDP, but beyond these strong symbols, many disagreements exist between its members.\n\nThe Chinese president thus praised the Eternal strategic partnership between Beijing and Astana, according to a letter published Tuesday by state media Pravda of KazakhstanThe organization's main objective is to combat what Beijing calls the three evils : separatism, terrorism and extremism. In a sign of the growing importance of the organization, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will also be present in Astana.",

Nearly all have focused on the candidates' delivery, less on what they said, and almost nothing about what should have been but was not said.\n\nTrump was obviously coached by his team to tone down the personal insults, which he mostly did, and scored some policy points while making dozens of false or unverified statements in the process.\n\nMeanwhile, as the general media analysis has also gone, Biden's delivery was a disaster. As one well known TV commentator called it: \"a slow motion car accident\".\n\nThe CNN host network's post-debate analysis panel was particularly critical.\n\nAt least initially. In the post-debate commentary they offered initial assessments like:\n\nhe (Biden) \"seemed disoriented\" and delivered \"an atypically bad performance\" (David Axelrod).\n\n\"His candidacy has fallen\" (Scott Jennings). He was \"not coherent\" and \"real damage was done\" (Abby Phillips).\n\n\"He failed...No two ways about it\" (Kate Bidingfield).\n\nSeasoned election commentator for CNN, John King, called Biden's performance \"dismal\" and said there was now deep panic in the Democrat party. While perhaps the most liberal on the panel, Van Jones, described Biden's delivery as \"painful\", noting the debate was the 'Con Man vs. the Old Man' and the affair appeared as a debate between \"somebody who shouldn't be president and another who can't do the job\".\n\nMany of Biden's harshest critics on the panel were long time Democrat party operatives, like Axelrod, Jones, and Bidingfield. The harshest criticism was leveled afterward by former Presidential debate moderator, Chris Wallace, author of the aforementioned quote \"A car accident in slow motion\". He concluded \"he sunk his campaign tonight\".\n\nIt's clear that several of the panelists were by means of their ear phones connected during the debate with high ranking Democrat party donors and supporters. Van Jones and Axelrod, long time Democrat party operatives and advisers, both referred to calls they were getting during the debate. As Axelrod admitted \"Democrat Party leaders area reacting\" and in a state of panic over Biden's performance. Jones said he even received calls well in the middle of the panel discussion, during a commercial break by CNN, in which he was 'chewed out' by a Biden insider for his previous panel comments.\n\nNot surprising, as the panel discussion went on some of the panelists tried to walk back their earlier public criticism which was contributing to the 'panic', according to some party sources. It's likely that some of the CNN panelists won't be around for subsequent debates if they occur. Or at least they won't be allowed to wear ear phones.\n\nAnyone watching the debate and the post debate commentary might easily conclude that Trump was not all that impressive, reducing his statements and rebuttals every chance he had to the border immigration issue; or making statements like 'he's killing the country\" and \"what he has done is criminal\"; or throwing out wild unsubstantiated charges declaring Biden's policies on abortion led to doctors to killing eight or nine month old.\n\nBiden debated in the dirt no less, often focusing on Trump's infidelity affairs and, in one of his few entertaining 'one liners' declaring \"you (Trump) have the morality of an alleycat\" or \"you're a whinner\". How many times each rebutted the other by simply calling him a 'liar' probably set a record for presidential debates.\n\nAs presidential debates go, this time around the CNN moderators asked no trick questions -- as occurred in prior presidential debates -- and their questions challenged the candidates to address some serious points. But when it came to explaining their policies and proposals neither candidate performed very well. They either ignored the moderators' questions altogether, or drifted off point, slide into another of their favorite topics, or descended into the silliest and most childish attacks on their opponent.\n\nPoll after poll today shows American voters are most concerned about two issues: Economy and War. But anyone watching the debate got no idea what either candidate intended to do for the economy stuck in chronic inflation, interest rates, weakening job market, declining real wages, and a growing fiscal crisis marked by the past eight years of $13.3 trillion additional budget deficits and $14.9 trillion in added national debt. Since 2000 deficits and debt have been doubling every eight years and the worst eight have been the most recent, 2016-2024, under Trump and Biden.\n\nWhen it came to answering the moderators' questions on the economy, Trump ducked their questions altogether several times, used the question to slip into elaborating further on one of his favorite themes like the border, or just answered with an off the wall personal accusation of Biden.\n\nBiden did no better: he mumbled, changed his topic and sentence mid-stream, confused words, and hesitated with long pauses as if he lost his train of thought. At one point after saying the US had a thousand trillionaires, then correcting it to billionaires, he mumbled incoherently for almost a half minute, lost his thought, and ended with a topically unrelated phrase \"we finally beat Medicare\". Trump predictably jumped on it and rebutted, 'Yes, you beat Medicare to death'.\n\nThese kind of petty, juvenile exchanges went on all during the debate. Perhaps the most pathetic, however, was late in the debate when both candidates got into a pissing match over who had the lowest golf handicap. Somehow they then both segwayed into accusing the other being the unhealthiest. Biden charged Trump of being too fat, to which Trump replied he had taken two health tests and passed both with excellent results while Biden hadn't taken even one.\n\nAt that point, following the golf thing, most watchers must have said to themselves: 'what the hell are they talking about'? Then probably followed that by saying to themselves, 'holy shit are we really in trouble'!. Yes, the USA is in trouble. Big trouble. And both the candidates aren't really talking about it. Nor have the slightest idea what to do about it.\n\nWhich brings it all back to what the American voters wanted most to hear in the debate but didn't -- i.e. what are the two lightweights called Trump and Biden going to do about escalating War and declining Economy?\n\nPolls consistently show voters want to know what are the candidates' proposals for dealing with inflation, jobs, runaway annual trillion dollar US budget deficits, the $35 trillion US national debt -- not to mention unaffordable housing, healthcare, child care, and student debt? And on the geopolitical front: what would either do as president about the three wars the US is involved in (Ukraine, Gaza, Red Sea) -- and the fourth that is obviously being planned (Taiwan)?\n\nVery little was revealed by either candidate during the debate as to how they planned to deal with the voters' top issues of War and the Economy. Here's what was not said by the candidates on the real issues of import:\n\nThe Economy\n\nThe very first question the moderators asked the candidates was the state of the US economy. Moderators noted many voters felt the economy was 'worse off', with groceries up 20% and home prices 30% since 2020.\n\nJobs\n\nBiden ducked the inflation question and launched into a statement how great the economy was now. His main point in that regard was his claim he had created 15 million jobs since taking office. That claim, however, is a misrepresentation and a selective interpretation of government statistics that he and the Democrats have been peddling throughout the campaign.\n\nThe fact is the Covid recession of 2020 resulted in 35 million being unemployed at one time or another due to government mandated economic shutdown. When Biden took office in 2021 there were 12-13 million still jobless. The US economy began to reopen in late spring 2021. It was too early. It aborted and only began again to steadily and slowly reopen later that summer 2021. It was in late summer 2021 when inflation began to accelerate.\n\nOver the next two years the twelve million mandated jobless returned to the jobs they had left. But these were not new jobs Biden 'created'. These were jobs workers 'returned to'. Biden did not create those 12 million jobs. There were additionally some net new jobs created in addition to those 'returned to' over the course of Biden's term. About 2.7 million. However, they have been mostly part time jobs not full time. Only by manipulating the numbers is Biden able to claim he created 15 million jobs.\n\nAs for the unemployment rate of 4% and Biden's claim it's the lowest in decades, that too is questionable. The 4% is what the US Labor Dept. calls the U-3 unemployment rate which refers only to full time workers. The government has another statistic that rarely gets reported in the mainstream media. It's called the U-6 unemployment rate and it covers not only full time workers but part time, those who've given up looking for work, dropped out of the labor force altogether, and simply haven't filed for unemployment benefits even though they're jobless. That also official US government U-6 unemployment rate is 7.4%, not 4%; or almost twice the always reported lower U-3 number by the mainstream media.\n\nTrump of course had no idea about these clarifications of Biden's misleading jobs claims. Nor apparently did his advisers. So Trump simply failed to challenge Biden on these job numbers.\n\nInflation\n\nThe moderator's question about why many voters don't feel economically 'better of' included a reference to a basket of groceries up 20% and home prices 30% since Biden. Biden's answer was he brought prescription drug prices down, referring to insulin prices for seniors on Medicare.\n\nTrump said he did it. Biden said he did. What ensued was a 'he said, she said' silly exchange. But the fact is prescription drug prices in general are going through the roof. And drug price inflation is not accurately picked up by the official US government inflation statistics. For example, he newest drugs aren't included. Nor factored into inflation are pharmaceutical companies moving their existing drugs into higher 'tiers' in their formulary (list of drug prices).The most purchased drugs' prices are raised more than average, while thousands of drugs not purchased hardly any more are not. The result is a lower average price for all drugs that the government uses in its inflation statistics.\n\nIt was at this point following the drug price inflation, only three minutes into the debate, that Biden went off the rails mumbling incoherently about several unrelated topics, going silent for loss of words, and concluding with the \"we finally beat Medicare\" comment.\n\nIf Trump had been prepared he could have elaborated on what's really happening with the costs of medical services -- a topic on which Biden remained silent for good reason since hospital and medical services are recently among the fastest rising services inflation.\n\nBiden instead repeated his campaign line that more people now have medical insurance than ever before. But at what cost? And how much coverage given the higher cost? According to research by the Kaiser Family Foundation, monthly health insurance premiums for a $65k/yr median income family of four are now about $2,000/mo. ($23,968/yr); for an individual $8,435 a year. Moreover, for 51% of households the same monthly premiums have deductibles of $2k-$3k per year. The other 49% households have deductibles of $600-$900/yr. What good is medical insurance coverage if the cost of insurance is unaffordable?\n\nThe debate moderators indicated housing prices had risen 30% and asked what either candidate would do about it. Once again, Trump ducked the question altogether and went on to rail about the border, immigration, and rapes and deaths caused by terrorists and criminals at the border. Biden too ducked the question, trying to turn it into the topic of tax cuts -- Trump's and his.\n\nHere's why both candidates didn't want to talk about housing costs or inflation in general:\n\nAccording to the Wall St. Journal in a recent June 2024 survey, home prices have surged 50% not 30% as the moderators noted. But even that 30% is a gross underestimate. What people pay is a mortgage which includes interest charges and other fees not just a monthly principal on the price of the house. Nor are any other interest costs, in credit cards, auto loans or any other source. If they were, the government's formal price indexes would be much higher since the CPI does not include in its inflation estimate any of the above mortgages, fees, etc. And according to the Wall St. Journal, 'Home Monthly Mortgage Payments' have risen 114% under Biden.\n\nRent prices follow home mortgages. But US government's price indexes like CPI and PCE only record 'new leases', not renters whose landlords raised their existing rents. Then there's the further trend of landlords adding all kinds of new monthly fees to their rents. That too is not picked up in the official inflation stats. Even so, government limited statistics still show rent increases exceeding 20% since 2021. In reality, it's at least 30-40% and far more in some cases.\n\nPrices for processed foods have also surged since 2019. These prices are subject to big monopolistic corporations' price gouging. Processed foods inflation is responsible for most of the 35% rise in the most often purchased grocery goods since 2019, according to the Journal.\n\nGovernment statistics show many basic household food staples have risen significantly since 2019: Bread up 52%, Eggs 114%. Pound of chicken breast 37%. Milk 24%. And food 'away from home' category (restaurants, bars, etc.) is also rising faster than reported. For example, the US statistics for 'food away from home' don't include the recent ratcheting up of tips charges, in some restaurants mandatory. Tip rates used to be 10%, 15% and 18% at most. Now it's an automatic 18%, 22% or 25% to the restaurant bill. Fast food away from home, that many low income households rely upon, has fared no better. Statistics show that a 'Big Mac' meal is up 27% since 2019.\n\nTransportation is the third largest weighted category in the inflation statistics. It includes the prices of autos, auto insurance, repairs, cost of a gallon of gas and other items. Car prices surged in 2021-23 and then leveled off, making the latest year stats appear 'tamed'. But auto insurance has accelerated by more than 20% the past year alone, following auto repair services up by at least that amount. Gasoline initially accelerated in 2021-2022 due to global and domestic supply issues, then leveled off. When prices 'level off' it appears the inflation has abated. But consumers remain paying the previous higher prices and that's what they remember. Consumers remember they are now paying 38% more for a gallon of gas since Biden took office.\n\nPoliticians, mainstream media, and many mainstream professional economists have been spinning the message that the US economy is doing great. Inflation is under control. Unemployment low. As Biden said during the debate \"The US is the greatest economy in the world\". But consumers know what they're actually paying, workers know what they're actually getting paid and the extra jobs they have to take on to make ends meet. Consumers and workers have longer memories than the politicians, media and economists want them to have. They know what the inflation and job score is since 2019. And don't care that much what the others say about the last six months or even year.\n\nIn short, the tens of millions of the roughly 130 million households in the USA know when the politicians or their mainstream economists echo chamber keep telling them 'Oh, the economy is doing great!' is not the reality they face.\n\nTax Cuts\n\nAt another point in the debate the moderators raised the question of Trump's 2018 tax cuts and if the candidates, especially Trump, would once again support the extension of the cuts coming up in 2025. Trump totally ducked the question, except to say his tax cuts -- which by the way amounted to $4.5 trillion over a decade -- produced a massive number of jobs. That job creation of course did not occur. The tax cuts of 2018 went mostly to wealthy investors and US businesses and corporations, who then either hoarded the savings or plowed it back into financial markets or invested abroad. Very little went into investments that resulted in business expansion that created jobs.\n\nUnder Trump's first three years before Covid hit in 2020, the Fortune 500 corporations returned more than $3.5 trillion in stock buybacks and dividend payouts to their shareholders. Under Biden it's been closer to $4 trillion. During the debate Biden indicated he wanted to raise taxes on individuals earning more than $400k a year in income. That was blocked by Senators Manchin and Sinema of his own party, as were efforts in general to roll back Trump's $4.5 trillion. Biden refused to pressure either of these rogue Senators the past three years. Both are now leaving the Senate. Moderators should have asked Biden, now that Manchin and Sinema will be gone, if he now will reverse the Trump tax cuts if elected.\n\nDeficits & Debt\n\nOn the matter of the budget deficit which has been chronically running at more than $1T a year since 2019 and is expected to hit $1.9T this year, neither candidate had much to say. Trump mentioned it in general and Biden not at all. Nor did either say anything about how the accumulation of those annual deficits have created the current national debt of $35 trillion -- with annual interest payments of more than $800 billion and rising.\n\nBoth candidates' virtual silence to discuss the topics of deficit and debt likely had something to do with the fact that both of them have been responsible for record levels of deficits and debt on their watch: annual budget deficits rose $5.5T under Trump and $7.8T under Biden. The national debt accelerated an addition $7.7T under Trump and $7.2T under Biden. It's important to note that the record acceleration in both deficits and national debt occurred within just four years for Trump and Biden -- exceeding the levels attained over eight years in the case of both George W. Bush and Barack Obama. In short, Trump's contribution to escalating deficits and debt were just as bad as Biden's. No wonder neither candidate wanted to 'go there' and discuss the issue. Pointing fingers at the other would amount only to pointing fingers at themselves.\n\nMeanwhile, the continuing escalation of both deficits and debt constitute a major economic issue, as the driving forces for both -- tax cuts for corporations and the rich, slow growth of the economy despite massive fiscal stimulus, and chronic wars and their costs -- are policies both candidates fully endorse in their actions if not their campaign rhetoric. What would they do if elected about the trillion dollar plus annual US deficits and debt -- a question directly asked by the moderators -- was essentially ignored by both candidates.\n\nMeanwhile, a fiscal train wreck of the US economy is emerging that will result in massive social spending cuts in 2025 and after. But no one addressed that either. The moderators didn't even raise it.\n\nTariffs\n\nBiden challenged Trump's recently announced proposal to raise tariffs on all imports and use the revenue to eliminate the corporate income tax. He charged it would be inflationary as corporations passed on the higher costs to consumers. Trump hit back with the charge he (Biden) has been agreeing with his tariff policy by continuing his (Trump) tariffs and expanding them against China as well. But that exchange about tariffs was as far as both candidates went in discussing the increasingly unstable global economy. The subject of the state of the global economy and its consequences for the US was simply 'several pay grades' beyond their intellect.\n\nMissing in the debate as well was any discussion whatsoever as to how the Biden sanctions on Russia and China have encouraged the rapid expansion of the BRICS countries. Formerly five countries, since Biden's sanctions policies the BRICS have doubled in number to 11 with 25 more applying for membership this year. Nor was it asked how the BRICS's forthcoming new global financial structure later this year will impact the US economy in 2025 and beyond.\n\nThat growth of the BRICS and its consequences is perhaps the single most important global economic development unfolding today. However, what the BRICS expansion means for the US economy was never even raised in the debates, let alone debated.\n\nTo sum up regarding the quality of the debate on the topic of the economy, neither candidate had the capacity, or even apparently any interest, in addressing the critical economic issues the country faces. Both candidates either ducked questions by the moderators that were related to economic matters or diverted the discussion to their pet topics when the moderators raised important economic issues. In other words, neither proposed solutions to the pressing economic issues voters want to hear.\n\nThe Wars\n\nThe same inability and/or refusal to explain how they'd deal with the deepening US involvement in the wars abroad further characterized the presidential debate.\n\nOrganizers began setting up early Monday morning on the University of Oregon campus in Eugene. They say the encampment isn't intended to interfere with campus activities or classes. (Source: Nathan Wilk / KLCC)\n\nThe USA is currently mired in three wars -- all of which appear to be intensifying:\n\nUkraine, Israel in Gaza and soon perhaps Lebanon, and in the Red Sea with Yemen.\n\nBiden's regime has been paying the bills for all, totaling at least $300 billion so far -- i.e. a major cause of the US deteriorating budget deficits and national debt. The USA is also deeply involved in providing weapons in all three; and increasingly as well in manpower in the form of advisers and officers on the ground in Ukraine and Israel, and a full US navy carrier task force in the Red Sea. Direct weapons and other financial aid costs has amounted at least to $200-$250 billion; add another minimum $50 billion in Pentagon OCO (overseas contingent operations) costs.\n\nUnfortunately the candidates were not even asked if the US can continue to afford that level of spending; or if the returns so far have justified it.\n\nWhen asked on the subject before the debate Biden's response has been consistently that the US can afford multiple wars. As he put it: 'What do you mean. This is the United States of America. The most powerful country the world has even seen!\"\n\nHis view the US can afford and fight multiple wars has been echoed by other members of his administration, like Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. However, neither Biden or Yellen have said who will have to do with less in order to continue to pay for USA's multiplying war involvement -- which by many estimates exceeds $8 trillion in the past two decades? Where's the money in the next four years to come from: What social programs will be cut in 2025-28 if either is elected? Whose taxes raised? Or how much more debt will have to be issued by the US Treasury on top of the US current $35 trillion national debt -- the latter now projected to rise to $54 trillion by 2033 with annual interest costs well over $1 trillion/yr payable to bondholders?\n\nThe only detailed exchange on Wars between the candidates was Afghanistan.\n\nBiden bragged \"we got 100,000 out\". To which Trump retorted that US soldiers died in the retreat which was hastily and sloppily conducted, made the US look weak and somehow, per Trump, encouraged Putin to invade Ukraine. Those remarks opened the door for Biden to jump into his favorite war subject: the Ukraine conflict.\n\nHe accused Trump of giving the green light to Putin to invade -- i.e. contradicting the history of events from June 2021 to February 2022 during which Biden policy was to refuse to even talk to Putin, rejected all requests to do so, and instead encouraged Zelensky in Ukraine to make increasingly provocative statements about joining NATO and intentions to militarily invade the eastern Ukraine provinces. Trump criticized Biden's Afghanistan pull out but never understood it as a link in the Biden decision in early 2021 to provoke war in Ukraine. The USA retreat from Afghanistan was a 'clearly of the decks' to prepare for war with Ukraine.\n\nBiden's remarks on the war in Ukraine avoided the moderator's direct question what did he plan to do about it.\n\nInstead, Biden repeated one-liners straight out the 1970s cold war era saying\n\n\"Putin is a war criminal. He wants to restore the Soviet Empire and won't stop there\".\n\nOr \"Just see what happens to Poland if Putin wins in Ukraine\".\n\nIn other words, the old 'dominoes theory'. Just as that view was the center piece of US ideology during the Vietnam war, Biden's view of the war in Ukraine is taken from the US war justification playbook during the 1970s. The moderators' question how would he address the US wars abroad was a non starter. Biden answered indirectly 'he wouldn't'. Biden policy is US can afford multiple wars which he intends to continue.\n\nLater in the debate Biden spouted even more worn out 1970s ideology about US power. So the debate audience was treated to such statements during the debate like: \"we're needed to protect the world. We're a powerful nation.\" And then the kicker: \"everybody trusts us\". Listening to Biden one gets the impression we're half a century back in the old cold war with the USSR. Even more scary, he apparently actually believes he is?\n\nTrump's line of argument on Ukraine as well as Israel was as simplistic: if he were president the wars wouldn't have happened. Somehow, he suggested, he would have been so threatening to all sides of the conflicts in Israel-Gaza and Ukraine that they would have cowered in fear of his threats and not gone to war in the first place.\n\nSo there was no need to explain what to do about them now; they wouldn't have happened.\n\nIn the case of Israel, when asked by moderators if he, Trump, supported a Palestinian state he dodged the question and instead criticized Biden for restraining Israel: \"Biden's holding Israel back. Israel wants to go. Let them go\". Trump's animus toward Iran is well known. It is likely he wouldn't need much encouragement to provoke a war with Iran should that latter country support its Hezbollah allies in the event of an Israel attack into Lebanon. Trump may be 'softer' on the Ukraine war but even more aggressive than Biden on a middle east one focusing on Iran. It wouldn't be the first time a US president ended one war and, to placate the pro-war forces in the US, start up another.\n\nOn the Ukraine war Trump was, and has been, more amenable to forcing a compromise with the Russians. In the debate, and on many occasions before, his main charge against Biden is the cost of Ukraine so far, which to date is in excess of $200 billion according to Trump. So the main problem is the US is spending too much money on it. Get the Europeans to cough up more is the suggestion. In a sense, Trump's position on Ukraine is an extension of his more general view that Europe/NATO should pay more.\n\nTo sum up Trump on the Israel and Ukraine wars: neither would have happened. He would have been tough and intervened and gotten all sides to settle beforehand. Israel is different than Ukraine, however. Iran has always been on Trump's shit list; Russia has not. So based on his comments in the debate, if elected he would likely approve a broader war in middle east if it meant going after Iran. Which seems somewhat ironic since, in the debate, he accused Biden of war policies as \"driving us to World War 3\".\n\nBiden's view on Ukraine is apparently just to continue as is. In place of answering the moderators' question how he might resolve the conflict, it's clear Biden's generalities in the debate mean let the war continue. Resolution occurs only when Russia is defeated. After all, if he's not, the Russians will eventually march on Paris! He didn't say Paris, but did say Poland. Dominoes again! Spending money on the wars may have been the core concern of Trump, but for Biden money is not the question. The US and NATO should spend as much of it as needed.\n\nOn Israel Biden refused to get specific. He said little if anything since the US position is to let Israel proceed in Gaza, fund whatever it asks of the US, and do what it must to prevent a further attack on Israel from other quarters or at least to contain it and prevent a wider war breaking out. However, none of this was discussed in the debate by Biden.\n\nThe other two wars -- Red Sea with the Houthis and with China over Taiwan -- were never raised as questions and therefore easily avoided altogether by both candidates. A simple query from the moderators might have been: 'why is a full task force of the US Navy unable to stop the Yemenis from sinking ships and preventing two thirds of the normal flow of container shipping traffic through the Red Sea'? Or how much is it costing the US to maintain a carrier task force off the Arabian peninsula?\n\nAnd then there's biggest war in planning by the USA: against China in Taiwan. Not a word asked, and not a word said about Biden administration plans now being implemented to prepare for a war with China over Taiwan. Moderators could at least have asked about recent US admirals and generals stationed in the far east who have publicly been saying war with China was inevitable and coming by 2030?\n\nOr the moderators might have asked: 'why are US Marines now landing and occupying Philippine islands within view of Taiwan and elsewhere in the South China sea and training again to carry out amphibious landings?\n\nOne can understand why Biden, the author of the pending conflict, wouldn't want to debate such matters. Perhaps the moderators got that message before developing their lists of questions. Or maybe the questions list was vetted by the parties (which was the case in fact). But Trump limited his criticisms of Biden China policy during the debate to the topic of tariffs.\n\nApart from questions of War and Economy there were other glaring omissions in the debate. At one point the moderators specifically did ask each candidate what they would do about the fact 2023 was the hottest year on record? Biden said he passed legislation -- presumably the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 -- that subsidized businesses investing in alternative energy. Biden also hyped his 'climate corps' idea. Trump ducked the question of climate change, referring instead to the need for 'clean water and clean air'. Both candidates briefly indulged in an unintelligible discussion of the Paris Climate Accords.\n\nIn other words, there was not much substantive discussion over what is in fact a 5th war underway: the war on Nature. Or rather one should say Nature's war on us which Nature so far is winning. Neither candidate thus answered the moderators' question on 2023 the hottest year on record which is another way of saying: what are you going to do to prevent the climate from warming to the 2 degrees or more tipping point to which it is on track by 2035? Just as the candidates failed to provide answers how they would resolve the four US wars underway or in planning, so too the 5th was brushed off and left unanswered.\n\n*\n\nNote to readers: Please click the share button above.

        "body": "Weeks after Russian naval warships made a dramatic entry into Cuba, two naval ships have now arrived in another Caribbean country - Venezuela.\n\nF-16s May Suffer Same Fate As Su-27s; Ukraine Fears \"Falcons Could Become Sitting Ducks\" For Russia\n\nAfter conducting drills in the Atlantic Ocean and a stopover in Cuba, two Russian naval vessels docked in the Venezuelan port of La Guaira on July 2.\n\nTASS quoted the Russian Ministry of Defense as saying that since May 17, Russia's Northern Fleet, which includes the frigate Admiral Gorshkov and the oil tanker Akademik Pashin, has been performing duties such as \"guaranteeing the Russian naval presence\" in \"remote areas of the oceans.\"\n\n\"A detachment of Northern Fleet ships comprising the frigate Soviet Union Fleet Admiral Gorshkov and the medium maritime tanker Akademik Pashin made a call at the port of La Guaira in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The call will last several days. Afterward, the seamen of the Northern Fleet will continue to carry out their mission in the waters of the Atlantic Ocean,\" the fleet said.\n\nAfter the lengthy cruise, the Russian ship crews will have a chance to relax and see the local sights during the port stop.\n\nAccording to the Northern Fleet, the squadron departed for the long-distance mission on May 17. Russia laid down the voyage's primary objectives as demonstrating the flag and guaranteeing naval presence in isolated yet strategically significant oceanic regions.\n\nThe Soviet Union Fleet Admiral Gorshkov, for one, is a cutting-edge, multifunctional frigate equipped with high-precision guided missiles intended to conduct operations in far-off regions of the seas and oceans. The frigate's main strike weapon is the Kalibr-NK missile system. It is also armed with the latest Zircon hypersonic missile.\n\nThe tanker and Admiral Gosrhkov were two of the Russian ships that anchored in Havana, Cuba, in mid-June. However, the most keenly watched by the West was the presence of a Russian nuclear submarine 'Kazan.' The submarine was spotted just 90 miles off Florida as it sailed into the Caribbean, which the US has traditionally considered its backyard.\n\nThe submarine remained berthed in Cuba for about five days after conducting drills in the Atlantic Ocean. The crews of the frigate and submarine practiced the use of high-precision missile weapons using computer modeling against naval targets, indicating naval groups of a mock enemy located at a distance of over 600 kilometers.\n\nAlthough the United States said the drills posed no threat, some saw them as a show of force amid burgeoning tensions between the US and Russia.\n\nHowever, analysts expressed concern that the visit could be in line with Russian President Vladimir Putin's threat that Moscow could take \"asymmetrical steps\" elsewhere in the world in response to President Joe Biden's decision to allow Ukraine to use US-provided weapons to strike inside Russia to protect Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city.\n\nWhile the nuke submarine did not come to Venezuela, the deployment is still significant because it showcases Russia's resolve to strengthen cooperation with countries in the Caribbean, specifically those that remain at odds with the United States. Much like his late predecessor, Hugo Chávez, Maduro has developed a strong bond with Russia.\n\nAccording to reports in Russian media, Russian Ambassador Sergey Melik-Bagdasarov, Admiral Mariani Mata, head of the Main Directorate of International Military Cooperation in the Venezuelan Defense Ministry, and Vice Admiral Edward Centeno Mass, deputy commander of the Venezuelan Navy, participated in the welcoming ceremony for the ships.\n\n\"This is a vivid symbol of unbreakable Russian-Venezuelan friendship, which demonstrates our firm desire to further strengthen strategic partnership in all areas,\" the Russian ambassador told TASS.\n\nHe further announced that \"as a special symbol of our unbreakable friendship and military cooperation, our honorable guard company will participate in the upcoming July 5 parade on the occasion of Venezuela's Independence Day.\"\n\nOn his part, the deputy commander of the Venezuelan Navy, Vice Admiral Edward Centeno Mass, made a rather bold statement: \"Today we are receiving warships of the brotherly Russian Federation. Venezuela and Russia are brothers in the fight against US imperialism.\"\n\nThe two countries have been strengthening ties for several years. Russia even conducted joint war games in Venezuela in 2022. And, last fall, the Russian Pacific Fleet conducted major naval drills off Siberia and close to Alaska.\n\nThe Russian Navy training ship Perekop also participated in a naval parade in Venezuela on July 24, 2023, to commemorate the Battle of Lake Maracaibo's 200th anniversary. The commander-in-chief and president of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, visited the ship.\n\nThe relationship goes back several years, and Russia has traditionally condemned what it refers to as US interference. For instance, in 2019, the Russian Foreign Ministry said, \"We have warned against all interference in Venezuela's domestic affairs, including the use of force threatened by Washington and which is in violation of international law.\"\n\nThe engagement between the two states has seen an uptick after Russia invaded Ukraine. The president of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, has accused the West multiple times of attempting to \"dismember\" and \"demolish\" Russia by escalating the conflict in Ukraine. He referred to the Ukrainian leadership as a \"neo-fascist elite\" and labeled the Western sanctions on Russia \"madness.\"\n\nRussia's Su-57 Back In Reckoning For Indian Air Force; Modi, Putin Likely To Discuss Stealth Fighters For IAF\n\nIn February this year, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov arrived in Venezuela on a Latin American tour that included Cuba and Brazil and called to \"reinforce and strengthen the entire strategic map of comprehensive cooperation\" between the two countries under their \"unbreakable\" friendship.\n\nIn a move to challenge the political and economic hegemony of the US and Europe, the Russian Minister also stated that Moscow would support Venezuela's ambitions to join the BRICS organization, which was established in 2009 by South Africa, Brazil, Russia, India, and China.\n\nThis hasn't gone down well with the US, though, as it views the Caribbean and Southern America as both its traditional spheres of influence and areas that need to be secured for the country's overall security.\n\nIt does not help the US case that it has imposed heavy sanctions on Venezuela and has been backing Guyana. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has passed a law to create a new Venezuelan state around the oil-rich region of Essequibo in neighboring Guyana, which has been lamented as illegal by Guyana.\n\nHowever, the US continues to push against Venezuela, further pushing the South American country closer to the Kremlin.",

        "title": "Russian central bank vows to contain inflation as weekly prices soar",
        "body": "This content was produced in Russia where the law restricts coverage of Russian military operations in Ukraine\n\nBy Elena Fabrichnaya\n\nST PETERSBURG, July 3 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank will do everything to contain inflation and prevent the economy from overheating further, Governor Elvira Nabiullina said on Wednesday, as data showed consumer prices soaring by 0.66% in the past week alone.\n\nThe sharp jump in consumer prices from June 25 to July 1, reported by federal statistics service Rosstat, was mainly due to the indexation of housing and utilities tariffs, but still highlighted the extent of the challenge facing the central bank as it grapples with runaway inflation.\n\nAnalysts polled by Reuters this week expect the bank to hike rates by 200 basis points to 18% when it next meets on July 26. Annual inflation is already running at more than double the central bank's 4% inflation target.\n\n\"Inflation is a very harmful thing, both economically and socially. We will do everything we can to make it predictably low,\" Nabiullina told a financial forum in St Petersburg, adding that Russia needed to control inflation in order to secure long-term funding for its economy.\n\nNabiullina has faced criticism for the restrictively high cost of borrowing, but stood her ground when pushed on Wednesday by Russian aluminium tycoon Oleg Deripaska.\n\nNabiullina pointed to the example of Turkey, which like Russia is struggling with high inflation but, unlike Russia, is not under Western sanctions and still has access to international capital markets.\n\nTurkey's attempts to lower rates while inflation is high were \"economic experiments\" that Russia could not afford to make.\n\n\"I do not want economic growth rates to be provided for by the population paying more for goods and services,\" Nabiullina said. \"It is unacceptable.\"\n\nWhen Deripaska complained about prohibitively high interest rates stifling investment, Nabiullina turned to the heads of Russia's two largest banks, Sberbank's German Gref and VTB's Andrei Kostin, who agreed that lowering borrowing costs would have terrible consequences.\n\n\"It would be a signal to all banks, in general to the whole economy, that our last sensible institution called the central bank had had some serious malfunction,\" Gref said.

        "body": "Russia continues to regard Armenia as an ally despite mounting tensions between the two countries, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Overchuk said on Wednesday, citing a continuing rapid growth in bilateral trade.\n\n\"We proceed from the fact that Armenia is our ally,\" he told Russian media. \"And we proceed from the fact that we have very positive economic relations. Our [2023] trade turnover with Armenia is $7.3 billion. If we look at the statistics for January-April [2024,] it doubled compared with [the same period of] last year.\"\n\nOverchuk went on to praise Yerevan's \"very constructive contribution\" to the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU), a Russian-led trade bloc comprising Russia, Armenia and three other ex-Soviet states.\n\nThe Russian vice-premier warned as recently as on June 25 that Armenia's continued membership in the bloc is \"incompatible\" with its possible bid to join the European Union backed by some Armenian officials. He said the South Caucasus country risks losing tariff-free access to the Russian market and other economic privileges granted by Moscow.\n\nThe country's political leadership revived talk of an EU membership bid last month amid a continuing deterioration of Russian-Armenian relations. It held a parliamentary hearing on the issue for leaders of pro-Western fringe groups loyal to Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian. They urged the Armenian government to hold the referendum on joining the EU within the next three months.\n\nPashinian unexpectedly voiced misgivings about the idea on Monday. He said his administration should clarify whether the EU is ready to eventually admit Armenia before holding such a referendum.\n\nDespite the deepening rift between the two longtime allies, Russian-Armenian trade has skyrocketed since 2022, with Armenian entrepreneurs taking advantage of Western sanctions imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. Armenian government data shows that Russia's share in Armenia's foreign trade rose from over 35 percent in 2023 to almost 46 percent in January-April 2024. By comparison, EU countries accounted for just 5 percent of the four-month total.",

        "body": "DETAILS have emerged of an astonishing alleged \"peace plan\" orchestrated by Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian dictator is prepared to share sovereignty of Crimea with his long-term enemy in order to bring the curtains down on more than two years of bloodshed, according to reports.\n\nAnd according to sources in both Moscow and Kyiv, he has already sent his trusted interior minister Vladimir Kolokoltsev to the US with the new proposals.\n\nDespite being sanctioned, Kolokoltsev was allowed into the US ostensibly to attend a UN meeting of police chiefs.\n\nBut this was a ruse allowing him to travel to Washington on a VIP plane from Putin's presidential fleet to transmit to the US government the dictator's real demands for a peace deal, it is claimed.\n\nLeading Ukrainian TV journalist Dmitry Gordon said he had received details of the package from \"our intelligence sources\".\n\nRussian Telegram channel Gosdumskaya - which claims insider sources in Moscow - separately reported a similar set of Putin demands.\n\nThe package is likely to be unacceptable to Ukraine, which would have to cede huge swathes of invaded territory, and be barred from joining NATO, but it is concessionary compared with Putin's demands in May.\n\nIt would see the Kremlin dictator gain spoils from going to war.\n\n\"The main purpose of his [Kolokoltsev's] arrival was to hand over Russia's peace plan to the US authorities,\" said Gordon, who said it was a Putin plan \"to end the war\".\n\nThe demands were that Ukraine must completely withdraw from Donetsk and Luhansk regions, both of which are now partially annexed by Russia.\n\nBut Russia would hand over Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station and the nearby town of Enerhodar to Ukraine.\n\nAnd he would discuss the possible transfer of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions to the control of Ukraine.\n\nCrimea would become a \"specially demilitarised administrative territory with dual subordination to Ukraine and the Russian Federation\".\n\n\"Ukraine must take on itself legally binding international guarantees, not to block the supply of water to Crimea,\" said Gordon, reading from a document.\n\nPutin seized the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea in 2014 and vowed he would never return it to Ukraine.\n\nUkraine would also control a 62-mile-wide \"demilitarised zone\" along the Dnipro River.\n\nThe Ukrainian army would have a legal maximum size, and the country would be barred from joining NATO, a key Zelinsky goal.\n\nBut Putin would not seek to block Ukraine joining the EU.\n\nThe West would drop sanctions on Russian oil and gas, as well as banking.\n\nGordon gave the army size as 350,000, but the Gosdumskaya Telegram channel said 150,000.\n\nThe UN meeting that the Russian minister attended was a \"diversionary manoeuvre\", said Gordon.\n\n\"The Donetsk and Luhansk regions cannot be transferred under the control of Ukraine, because this will cause, they say, the imminent genocide of the population of the territory, a third of which took part in hostilities against Ukraine,\" said Gordon.\n\nThere has been no official comment from the US, Russia or Ukraine over the alleged back channel contacts concerning Kolokoltsev's visit.\n\nIntriguingly, Kolokoltsev's plane was seen alongside former US president Donald Trump's aircraft as it arrived in Washington.\n\nTrump has vowed that he could rapidly halt the debilitating war if re-elected and hinted that this would involve Ukraine ceding territory in exchange for security assurances short of being a NATO member.\n\nKolokoltsev, 63, has been Putin's Interior Minister for 12 years, in charge of Russian police.",

During the conversation, Ukraine's foreign minister expressed gratitude to the Netherlands for reaffirming its steadfast support for Ukraine.\n\nKuleba reported that the Netherlands will continue to provide military assistance to Ukraine, impose sanctions on Russia, bring Russia to justice for its crimes, and address the issue of abducted Ukrainian children.\n\nSeparately, the Ukrainian minister emphasised the importance of delivering the promised Patriot air defence system to Ukraine as soon as possible and thanked the Netherlands for its consistent leadership in all key areas.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, 3 July, Dick Schoof, the new Prime Minister of the Netherlands, who took over the government after the far-right's recent election victory, spoke about his first telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in which he assured the latter of his country's continued support for Kyiv.\n\nDutch Defence Minister Kajsa Ollongren announced on 21 June that the Netherlands, together with another country, would be sending a Patriot air defence system to Ukraine.\n\nThe Netherlands had announced in late May that it intended, with support from other countries, to assemble and deliver a Patriot air defence system to Ukraine in the near future.",

        "body": "Kyiv Post sources within Ukraine's Military Intelligence (HUR) said that a crucial Russian military-industrial complex plant, the Oskol Ugarov Electrometallurgical Combine (OEMK), was severely damaged early Monday, July 1, in a joint operation by HUR and the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR).\n\nKamikaze drones targeted two major electrical substations in the Belgorod region: the Stary Oskol substation near Neznamovo and the Metallurgicheskaya substation near Volokonovskoye, one of the largest in Europe. The attack resulted in the complete de-energization of OEMK, Russia's only full-cycle metallurgical enterprise.\n\nOEMK is renowned for its advanced technology, including direct reduction of iron and electric furnace melting, which produces high-quality, impurity-free metal.\n\nThe de-energization caused all electric arc furnaces to stop, with the metal inside freezing. Restarting the plant will require extensive cleaning and replacement of arc elements, potentially taking several months.\n\nSome workers believe new furnaces might be needed, and since the plant was built using German technology, German expertise may be required to resume operations.\n\nOEMK plays a vital role in Russia's military-industrial complex, producing high-quality steel for various industries, including automotive and mechanical engineering.\n\nIts products are used by key Russian enterprises such as Gaz, UAZ, Kamaz, EPK, SKF, and AVTONORMAL, which manufacture automotive sheet steel, armor sheets, and components for military equipment.\n\nIn response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Metalloinvest Holding and OEMK were included in the US and UK sanctions lists on April 2, 2023.",

        "body": "The Russian Ministry of Finance and Central Bank are evaluating permanent stablecoin regulations for cross-border use.\n\nRussian authorities may approve the use of stablecoins in cross-border settlements, local media outlet Izvestia reported.\n\nLegalizing stablecoins for international settlements could simplify transactions with BRICS partners and reduce the impact of sanctions.\n\nSince February 2022, Russian businesses have faced significant payment difficulties due to sanctions and compliance measures. This has impacted both sanctioned companies and those not directly targeted.\n\nAlexei Guznov, chairman of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, stated that proposals to legalize stablecoins for international settlements have been formulated. The primary goal is to regulate the transfer, accumulation, and use of these assets for cross-border payments within Russia.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance is also evaluating this issue. Experts believe the legalization of stablecoins will not be experimental but a permanent norm. They highlight several advantages of using these assets for cross-border payments:\n\nLegalizing stablecoins could open new opportunities for Russia, particularly in resuming trade with countries that have imposed sanctions.\n\nRead more: Crypto Regulation: What Are the Benefits and Drawbacks?\n\nThe Russian Central Bank has long opposed any cryptoassets. However, external circumstances are gradually forcing the regulator to reconsider its stance.\n\nIn March, President Vladimir Putin signed a law authorizing the use of digital financial assets (DFAs) for cross-border settlements. However, implementation has stalled due to secondary sanctions risks and low liquidity of DFAs.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian commodity companies are already using the Tether (USDT) stablecoin for cross-border transactions with China. Although it may take some time for authorities to reach a decision, the current shift stresses out the resilience of cryptocurrencies and their expanding role in global trade.",

Mr Guterres wants \"to position the UN as an inclusive organisation that's talking to all the big clubs,\" said Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Centre.\n\nMr Putin wants to show that Russia is not isolated over Western sanctions from the invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nAn arrest warrant has been issued for him by the International Criminal Court for war crimes, accusing him of personal responsibility for abductions of children from Ukraine. Kazakhstan is not party to the Rome Statute and thus is not obliged to arrest him.\n\nFor Mr Putin, the meeting is about \"prestige and the symbolic optics that he's not alone,\" Mr Gabuev said.\n\nIndeed, the Russian leader on Wednesday had multiple meetings with other leaders on the side-lines of the summit, all diligently aired by Russian state TV.\n\nAt a meeting with Mr Xi on Wednesday, Mr Putin hailed the SCO as \"one of the key pillars of a fair, multipolar world order,\" and said ties between Moscow and Beijing are \"experiencing the best period in their history.\"\n\nBoth face soaring tensions with the West and have met about 40 times.\n\nTheir meeting in China in May underscored Beijing's diplomatic support for Moscow and how it is a top market for its oil and gas.

Mr Xi called for \"bridges of communication\" between countries last week and wants to further promote China as an alternative to the US and its allies.\n\nFor host Kazakhstan and the other central Asian nations, the meeting is a way to further their co-operation with bigger, more powerful neighbours.\n\nThis year, close Moscow ally Belarus will become a full member of the organisation, and its admission indicates how Russia wants to bolster blocs of non-Western countries.\n\nChina has backed Moscow amid the fighting in Ukraine, but at a meeting of the SCO in 2022, Mr Putin referred to Beijing's unspecified \"concerns\" over the conflict.\n\nIndia's Prime Minister Narendra Modi then called for an end to the fighting without voicing explicit disapproval of Moscow's action.\n\nNeither Ukraine nor any of its Western backers are attending, and major talks - or breakthroughs - on the war are not expected.\n\nBut because it is rare these days for any meeting to include the heads of Russia, China, Turkey and the UN, the possibility of talks about the war might be raised, at least on the peripheries of the summit, probably behind closed doors.\n\nThere could be \"a lot of side-line discussions on Ukraine, as it is a big issue which concerns all of us,\" a senior Kazakh official told the Associated Press.",

        "title": "Poland's Law and Justice chooses Meloni over Orbán in EU Parliament",
        "body": "Poland's Law and Justice (PiS) had been courted by Hungary's Viktor Orbán to join his brand new \"Patriots for Europe\" alliance.\n\nPoland's Law and Justice (PiS) has decided to remain part of the hard-right European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group, ending days of mounting speculation over the party's immediate political future.\n\nThe news became official during the ECR's constitutive meeting, which took place on Wednesday in a hybrid version after having been postponed over internal disagreements.\n\nThis means PiS chooses to stay with Giorgia Meloni, the dominant figure in the ECR family, and rebuffs Viktor Orbán's offer to join the so-called \"Patriots for Europe,\" a new alliance that aims to establish the largest far-right group in the European Parliament.\n\nSo far, Orbán's initiative has attracted Czechia's ANO, Austria's Freedom Party (FPÖ) and Portugal's Chega, all of whom share a deep-seated aversion to the Green Deal, the reform of the EU migration policy, and military provisions to Ukraine.\n\n\"Only through the victory and cooperation of patriotic and sovereigntist parties across the continent we can guarantee our children's inheritance,\" says their manifesto.\n\nForming a group in the Parliament requires a minimum of 23 MEPs, a threshold they already meet, coming from at least seven member states. This means that, as of today, the Patriots lack three national parties.\n\nDue to the ideological similarities, PiS appeared to be a shoo-in for the Patriots. Its 20 MEPs would have rapidly expanded the ranks of the nascent alliance and possibly helped attract additional affiliates.\n\nLast week's abrupt cancellation of the ECR constitutive meeting, reportedly due to a clash between the two main factions, Poland's PiS and Meloni's Fratelli d'Italia, sent alarm ringing about an imminent departure of the Polish delegation.\n\nMateusz Morawiecki, the former prime minister of Poland, said in an interview that the likelihood of PiS leaving was 50/50. \"We are tempted in both directions,\" he told Politico Europe, referring to Orbán's new initiative.\n\nA Parliament official told Euronews that PiS had entered negotiations with other groups.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what made PiS choose Meloni over Orbán.\n\nThe Hungarian premier's notorious desire to maintain close relations with Vladimir Putin has caused friction with the Poles, who detest the Russian leader and consistently advocate for harder sanctions to cripple his war economy.\n\nOrbán, by contrast, openly questions the efficiency of Western sanctions and is currently blocking €6.6 billion in EU military assistance to Ukraine.\n\nWednesday's news offers a sigh of relief to Giorgia Meloni, who hopes to increase the ECR's influence in the next legislature. Since coming into power, the Italian premier has adopted a more pragmatic stance on the European stage and sought to be part of the bloc's decision-making process.\n\nHer support was key to unblocking the New Pact on Migration and Asylum, an ambitious reform that her PiS allies frontally opposed. Her clout, however, is still limited: during last week's negotiations on the bloc's top jobs, Meloni was excluded by the main centrist parties, prompting a furious reaction.\n\nThe loss of her Polish allies would have dealt a new blow to her ambitions: the ECR would have fallen from 84 to 63 MEPs and relinquished its recently achieved position as the Parliament's third-largest force.\n\nWith the plunge averted, Meloni and her peers can continue their efforts to maximise their leverage and strike case-by-case alliances with the centre-right European People's Party (EPP) to stop environmental legislation and curb irregular migration.\n\nDuring Wednesday's meeting, the group elected Nicola Procaccini (FdI) and Joachim Stanisław Brudziński (PiS) as co-chairs for the next five years, consolidating the two delegations as the ones calling the shots inside the group.",

        "title": "Russian central bank vows to contain inflation as weekly prices soar",
        "body": "* This content was produced in Russia where the law restricts coverage of Russian military operations in Ukraine\n\nST PETERSBURG, July 3 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank will do everything to contain inflation and prevent the economy from overheating further, Governor Elvira Nabiullina said on Wednesday, as data showed consumer prices soaring by 0.66% in the past week alone.\n\nThe sharp jump in consumer prices from June 25 to July 1, reported by federal statistics service Rosstat, was mainly due to the indexation of housing and utilities tariffs, but still highlighted the extent of the challenge facing the central bank as it grapples with runaway inflation.\n\nAnalysts polled by Reuters this week expect the bank to hike rates by 200 basis points to 18% when it next meets on July 26. Annual inflation is already running at more than double the central bank's 4% inflation target.\n\n\"Inflation is a very harmful thing, both economically and socially. We will do everything we can to make it predictably low,\" Nabiullina told a financial forum in St Petersburg, adding that Russia needed to control inflation in order to secure long-term funding for its economy.\n\nNabiullina has faced criticism for the restrictively high cost of borrowing, but stood her ground when pushed on Wednesday by Russian aluminium tycoon Oleg Deripaska.\n\nNabiullina pointed to the example of Turkey, which like Russia is struggling with high inflation but, unlike Russia, is not under Western sanctions and still has access to international capital markets.\n\nTurkey's attempts to lower rates while inflation is high were \"economic experiments\" that Russia could not afford to make.\n\n\"I do not want economic growth rates to be provided for by the population paying more for goods and services,\" Nabiullina said. \"It is unacceptable.\"\n\nWhen Deripaska complained about prohibitively high interest rates stifling investment, Nabiullina turned to the heads of Russia's two largest banks, Sberbank's German Gref and VTB's Andrei Kostin, who agreed that lowering borrowing costs would have terrible consequences.\n\n\"It would be a signal to all banks, in general to the whole economy, that our last sensible institution called the central bank had had some serious malfunction,\" Gref said.

You can find more of these articles on the Onet home page.\n\nThe operation was carried out by HUR together with the \"Freedom of Russia\" Corps and with the help of a former Russian sailor under the pseudonym \"Gog\" who sided with Ukraine.\n\n\"In early April 2024, information appeared in the media space about an emergency on the small missile ship \"Serpukhov\" in Baltiysk, Kaliningrad Region, as a result of which the ship was seriously damaged and sent for repair,\" Yusov said.\n\nBehind the scenes of the movie \"Rybałka\".\n\n\"In fact, the \"state of emergency\" is the result of the special operation \"Rybałka\" (\"Fisherman\" in Polish - ed.), which was organized and carried out by patriots of a free Russia from the \"Freedom of Russia\" Corps. \"These are Russian citizens who carried out this daring and risky special operation, which caused enormous damage to both the Russian Navy and humiliatingly revealed the true state of the Russian army,\" Yusov noted.\n\nIn 2023, Goga, who was an active opponent of the Putin regime, joined the resistance forces of the Russian Freedom Corps.\n\nComplete article below the video\n\n\"Since 2023, the Russians have been actively cooperating (with us), transferring important information and finally carrying out the heroic act of disabling the missile ship. This is important because there are few such modern ships (in Russia - ed.). These are the Onyx and Kalibr missiles on board, and of course these are the same missiles that, unfortunately, hit Ukrainian civilian cities and infrastructure,\" the HUR representative noted.\n\nHor: There are no safe places in Russia\n\nAccording to Yusov, this operation showed that there are no safe places for the \"aggressor state,\" and that military infrastructure and targets can be attacked on the vast territory of the Russian Federation.\n\n\"This is our first operation in the Baltic Fleet. It was a big shock and surprise for the enemy. After this operation, there were adjustments, investigations and sanctions in the Baltic Fleet. Obviously, some heads turned there,\" Yusuf said.\n\nHe described the operation as another successful move by the Freedom of Russia Corps, which shows that Russians in the country are ready to fight Putin's regime.\n\nGoga stood by Ukraine\n\nGoga is now in Ukraine, ready to continue the fight against the regime of dictator Vladimir Putin. He admitted that he served in the Baltic Fleet for 11 years. In 2022, when a large-scale war broke out, he was the only soldier on his ship who opposed the war and did not hide his views.\n\n\"I tried to resign, saying that I could not serve in the army. The commander was shocked when he read that. The commander immediately sent me for psychological tests, he thought I was crazy, that I was opposing the Russians. \"The authorities sent me to a psychiatrist, and gave my report to the command and the prosecutor's office - to all the bodies to decide what to do with me next,\" the Russian said.\n\nAccording to the sailor, the prosecutor's office initiated administrative proceedings against him, but he was unable to escape from service. In 2023, he contacted the \"I Want to Live\" project and began cooperation with the Ukrainian Defense Intelligence Service.\n\n\"The main sphere of our activity is the Russian information space. Our task, I will say it perhaps more clearly, is to turn Russia into a powder keg. And the spark will be us - \"Freedom of Russia\". All sensible people whose outlook on life does not differ from reality understand that Putin has been destroying Russia for only 25 years, and I, as a Russian citizen, am offended by the Russian people who live in poverty and are deprived of their civil rights. - said Maximilian Andronikov, pseudonym. \"Caesar\", spokesman for the \"Freedom of Russia\" Legion, answers the question of the pap.\n\n\"Our main direction is to influence Russian society. We will achieve all the goals that we set for ourselves: the liberation of the territories of Ukraine and the reconstruction of Ukraine. I always emphasize this, that the moral obligation of the peoples of Russia is to restore everything that was destroyed here,\" he stressed.\n\n\"I would like to say that I made the right decision. Maybe I didn't have enough charisma, I couldn't find the right words to tell them (the people of Russia - ed.) that this war was criminal, that it simply shouldn't have happened,\" Goga said.\n\nThe Russian citizen called on his fellow citizens to join the \"Freedom of Russia\" legion in order to \"start helping Ukraine win.\"",

        "title": "LME plans to suspend nickel brand of Nornickel's Finnish plant from...",
        "body": "LONDON, July 3 (Reuters) - The London Metal Exchange (LME) will suspend the listing of a nickel brand produced by a plant in Finland owned by Russian metals giant Nornickel , it said on Wednesday, without providing a reason for the suspension.\n\nThe decision by the LME, the world's largest and oldest metals trading venue, is related to its responsible sourcing campaign, rather than Russia-related sanctions, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.\n\nThe LME declined to comment. Nornickel did not reply to a Reuters request for comment.\n\nDeliveries of nickel cathodes and briquettes produced by Norilsk Nickel Harjavalta Oy will not be accepted for the LME nickel contract warranting from Oct. 3, the LME said in two separate notices.\n\nThe LME, owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing , said in January it would suspend or delist 10% of its listed metals brands until their producers provided it with their responsible sourcing reports.\n\nHarjavalta, one of the largest nickel refining plants in Europe, is yet to complete its routine responsible minerals audit, one of the sources said, adding that the process was likely to be completed before the LME's Oct. 3 deadline.\n\nThe plant has an annual production capacity of 65,000 metric tons of nickel which it produces from raw materials of Russian or other origin. Nornickel itself produced 209,000 tons of nickel in 2023.\n\nThe LME in April banned from its system all Russian aluminium, copper and nickel produced from April 13 to comply with U.S. and UK sanctions imposed over Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nNornickel's Finnish plant was unaffected by that decision.

        "body": "Higher prices for Russia's flagship crude grade Urals boosted the Russian government's revenues from oil in June with proceeds rising by nearly 50% from a year earlier, Bloomberg estimated on Wednesday in calculations based on data from the Russian finance ministry.\n\nThe annual jump in Russia's revenues from the oil industry suggests that Russian producers have adapted to the Western sanctions and are selling their crude to willing buyers at higher prices.\n\nIn June, oil-related taxes for the Russian budget surged to $6.67 billion (590.6 billion Russian rubles), Bloomberg's calculations showed. This compares with $4.55 billion (402.8 billion rubles) in revenue from the oil industry in June last year.\n\nRussian data showed that the budget's combined revenues from the oil and gas industry surged by 41% year-over-year in June to $8.4 billion (746.6 billion rubles).\n\nRussian oil revenues have been rising in recent months compared to the year-ago levels as Moscow is increasingly finding ways to circumvent sanctions and find buyers willing to risk purchasing its crude and refined petroleum products.\n\nThe higher revenues from oil for Russia highlight the difficulties of the Western countries to reduce Putin's income from oil, despite the price cap on Russia's oil and the ramp-up of the sanctions enforcement in recent months.\n\nA weaker ruble and higher international and Urals grade prices have also helped raise oil revenues for Russia.\n\nLast month, Russia's finance ministry data showed that Russian budget revenues from oil and gas soared by 73.5% in January-May of 2024 compared to the first five months of 2023.\n\nBetween January and May 2024, the revenues for the Russian federal budget from oil and gas hit $55.7 billion (4.95 trillion Russian rubles).\n\nRussia's oil and gas revenues for June were projected to increase by over 50% year-on-year, reaching $9.4 billion, according to Reuters calculations from last week.",

        "body": "Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping will soon be meeting in person for the second time in two months as they visit Kazakhstan for a meeting of an international group founded to counter Western alliances.\n\nPutin and Xi last met in May when the Kremlin leader visited Beijing to underscore their close partnership that opposes the US-led democratic order and seeks to promote a more \"multipolar\" world.\n\nNow, they will be holding meetings as part of the annual session of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, which the two countries established in 2001 to discuss security concerns in Central Asia and the wider region.\n\nAmong its other members are Iran, India, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.\n\nThe meeting is another chance for Putin and Xi to demonstrate the strong personal ties in their \"strategic partnership\" as they both face soaring tensions with the West.\n\nPutin wants to show that Russia is not isolated by Western sanctions from the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. An arrest warrant has been issued for him by the International Criminal Court, which accuses him of personal responsibility for the abductions of children from Ukraine. However, Kazakhstan is not party to the Rome Statute, and thus is not obliged to arrest him.\n\nPutin's meeting with Xi in May showed how China has offered diplomatic support to Moscow and is a top market for its oil and gas. Russia has relied on Beijing as a main source of high-tech imports to keep its military machine running.\n\nThe organisation helps China project its influence, especially across Central Asia and the Global South. Xi called for \"bridges of communication\" between countries last week and wants to further promote China as an alternative to the US and its allies.",

        "title": "Leaders of Russia and China meet at a Central Asian summit in a show of deepening cooperation",
        "body": "Russian President Vladimir Putin, right, and Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan shake hands during their meeting on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Astana, Kazakhstan, Wednesday, July 3, 2024.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping met Wednesday for the second time in as many months as they visited Kazakhstan for a session of an international group founded to counter Western alliances.\n\nPutin and Xi last got together in May when the Kremlin leader visited Beijing to underscore their close partnership that opposes the U.S.-led democratic order and seeks to promote a more \"multipolar\" world.\n\nNow they'll be holding meetings amid the annual session of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization taking place Wednesday and Thursday in the Kazakh capital of Astana. A look at the summit:\n\nWhat is the Shanghai Cooperation Organization?\n\nThe Shanghai Cooperation Organization was established in 2001 by China and Russia to discuss security concerns in Central Asia and the wider region, Other members are Iran, India, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Observer states and dialogue partners include Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.\n\nWho's attending this year?\n\nBesides Putin and Xi, and summit host President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, other leaders there will be Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif of Pakistan, President Shavkat Mirziyoyev of Uzbekistan, President Emomali Rakhmon of Tajikistan, and President Sadyr Zhaparov of Kyrgyzstan. President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus will attend because his nation is becoming a full member.\n\nIran is still choosing a successor to President Ebrahim Raisi, killed in a helicopter crash in May, with a runoff election Friday, so acting President Mohammad Mokhbar will attend.\n\nOther guests of the SCO include President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan.\n\nAlso present will be U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, who is visiting Central Asia. Guterres wants \"to position the U.N. as an inclusive organization that's talking to all the big clubs,\" said Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.\n\nWhat SCO leaders won't be there?\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi of India is sending his foreign minister. Indian media reports speculated the recently reelected Modi was busy with the parliament session that began last week. He attended the recent Group of Seven summit in Italy, and some reports also speculated he wants to balance India's relationship with Russia and the West.\n\nWhat are their goals?\n\nPutin wants to show that Russia isn't isolated over Western sanctions from the invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nAn arrest warrant has been issued for him by the International Criminal Court for war crimes, accusing him of personal responsibility for abductions of children from Ukraine. Kazakhstan is not party to the Rome Statute and thus is not obliged to arrest him.\n\nFor Putin, the meeting is about \"prestige and the symbolic optics that he's not alone,\" Gabuev said.\n\nIndeed, the Russian leader on Wednesday had multiple meetings with other leaders on the sidelines of the summit, all diligently aired by Russian state TV.\n\nAt a meeting with Xi on Wednesday, Putin hailed the SCO as \"one of the key pillars of a fair, multipolar world order,\" and said ties between Moscow and Beijing are \"experiencing the best period in their history.\"\n\nBoth face soaring tensions with the West and have met about 40 times.\n\nTheir meeting in China in May underscored Beijing's diplomatic support for Moscow and how it's a top market for its oil and gas. Russia has relied on Beijing as a main source of high-tech imports to keep its military machine running.\n\nThe SCO helps China project its influence, especially across Central Asia and the Global South. Xi called for \"bridges of communication\" between countries last week and wants to further promote China as an alternative to the U.S. and its allies.\n\nErdogan also met with Putin, whose expected visits to Turkey haven't materialized. The leader of the NATO member has balanced relations with both Russia and Ukraine since the war began, frequently offering to serve as a mediator.\n\nFor host Kazakhstan and the other Central Asian nations, the meeting is a way to further their cooperation with bigger, more powerful neighbors. Kazakhstan, for instance, frequently engages with both neighboring Russia and China, while also pursuing links with the West, with visits this year from U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and British Foreign Secretary David Cameron.\n\nWhat will be discussed?\n\nCountering terrorism is a key focus. Russia had what it has called two terrorist attacks this year, with more 145 people killed by gunmen at a Moscow concert hall in March, and at least 21 people were killed in attacks on police and houses of worship in the southern republic of Dagestan in June. In the March violence, the U.S. warned Russian officials about the possibility of an attack -- information that was dismissed by Moscow.\n\nThe SCO is not a collective security or economic alliance, and there are \"significant security differences between its members,\" said Nigel Gould-Davies, a senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia with the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London and a former British ambassador to Belarus. The \"principal value\" of the organization lies in the optics of non-Western countries gathering together, he added.\n\nGabuev agreed, saying the SCO is a place for conversation rather than a platform where \"collective decisions are made, implemented and have an impact.\"\n\nThis year, close Moscow ally Belarus will become a full member of the organization, and its admission indicates how Russia wants to bolster blocs of non-Western countries. Gould-Davies said the SCO is raising its profile \"by growing its membership rather than by deepening its cooperation.\"\n\nAre there tensions within the SCO?\n\nPolitical differences among some of SCO members -- such as India and Pakistan over disputed Kashmir -- also make it difficult to reach collective agreement on some issues.\n\nChina has backed Moscow amid the fighting in Ukraine, but at a meeting of the SCO in 2022, Putin referred to Beijing's unspecified \"concerns\" over the conflict. India's Modi then called for an end to the fighting without voicing explicit disapproval of Moscow's action.\n\nThe Central Asian countries balance relations with Russia and China while also remaining on good terms with Western nations. None of the five former Soviet republics in Central Asia have publicly backed the war, although all abstained on a U.N. vote condemning it.\n\nGuterres may use the meeting to talk to Putin about how Russia is \"disrupting the coherence of the U.N.,\" Gabuev said. Russia has vetoed U.N. Security Council sanctions on monitoring North Korea and a vote on stopping an arms race in outer space.\n\nWith Guterres unlikely to visit Moscow, the Astana meeting is likely his best chance to speak to Putin, Gabuev added.\n\nWill Ukraine be discussed?\n\nNeither Ukraine nor any of its Western backers are attending, and major talks -- or breakthroughs -- on the war are not expected.\n\nBut because it's rare these days for any meeting to include the heads of Russia, China, Turkey and the U.N., the possibility of talks about the war might be raised, at least on the peripheries of the summit, probably behind closed doors.\n\nThere could be \"a lot of sideline discussions on Ukraine, as it is a big issue which concerns all of us,\" a senior Kazakh official told The Associated Press. The official was not authorized to talk publicly, and thus spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nGabuev said Putin will try to show there's a \"big club of countries\" that are \"ambivalent\" toward the war in Ukraine.\n\n-- -\n\nBurrows reported from London.

        "title": "Putin and Xi are meeting again in Central Asia Summit. What does their growing alliance mean?",
        "body": "Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin shake hands in Beijing, May 16, 2024. The two are set to meet again July 3 and 4 at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping will be meeting for the second time in as many months as they visit Kazakhstan for a session of an international group founded to counter Western alliances.\n\nMr. Putin and Mr. Xi last got together in May when the Kremlin leader visited Beijing to underscore their close partnership that opposes the U.S.-led democratic order and seeks to promote a more \"multipolar\" world.\n\nNow they'll be holding meetings amid the annual session of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization on July 3 and 4 in the Kazakh capital of Astana. A look at the summit:\n\nThe Shanghai Cooperation Organization was established in 2001 by China and Russia to discuss security concerns in Central Asia and the wider region. Other members are Iran, India, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Observer states and dialogue partners include Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt.\n\nBesides Mr. Putin and Mr. Xi, and summit host President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, other leaders there will be Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif of Pakistan, President Shavkat Mirziyoyev of Uzbekistan, President Emomali Rakhmon of Tajikistan, and President Sadyr Zhaparov of Kyrgyzstan. President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus will attend because his nation is becoming a full member.\n\nIran is still choosing a successor to President Ebrahim Raisi, killed in a helicopter crash in May, with a runoff election July 5, so acting President Mohammad Mokhbar will attend.\n\nOther guests of the SCO include President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan.\n\nAlso present will be U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, who is visiting Central Asia. Mr. Guterres wants \"to position the U.N. as an inclusive organization that's talking to all the big clubs,\" said Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi of India is sending his foreign minister. Indian media reports speculated the recently reelected Mr. Modi was busy with the parliament session that began last week. He attended the recent Group of Seven summit in Italy, and some reports also speculated he wants to balance India's relationship with Russia and the West.\n\nMr. Putin wants to show that Russia is not isolated over Western sanctions from the invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nAn arrest warrant has been issued for him by the International Criminal Court for war crimes, accusing him of personal responsibility for abductions of children from Ukraine. Kazakhstan is not party to the Rome Statute and thus is not obliged to arrest him.\n\nFor Mr. Putin, the meeting is about \"prestige and the symbolic optics that he's not alone,\" Mr. Gabuev said.\n\nThe meeting is another chance for Mr. Putin and Mr. Xi to demonstrate the strong personal ties in their \"strategic partnership\" as they both face soaring tensions with the West. They have met more than 40 times.\n\nMr. Putin's meeting with Mr. Xi in May showed how China has offered diplomatic support to Moscow and is a top market for its oil and gas. Russia has relied on Beijing as a main source of high-tech imports to keep its military machine running.\n\nThe SCO helps China project its influence, especially across Central Asia and the Global South. Mr. Xi called for \"bridges of communication\" between countries last week and wants to further promote China as an alternative to the U.S. and its allies.\n\nMr. Erdogan could use the meeting to hold talks with Mr. Putin, who has postponed several visits to Turkey. The leader of the NATO member has balanced relations with both Russia and Ukraine since the war began, frequently offering to serve as a mediator.\n\nFor host Kazakhstan and the other Central Asian nations, the meeting is a way to further their cooperation with bigger, more powerful neighbors. Kazakhstan, for instance, frequently engages with both neighboring Russia and China, while also pursuing links with the West, with visits this year from U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and British Foreign Secretary David Cameron.\n\nCountering terrorism is a key focus. Russia had what it has called two terrorist attacks this year, with more than 145 people killed by gunmen at a Moscow concert hall in March, and at least 21 people were killed in attacks on police and houses of worship in the southern republic of Dagestan in June. In the March violence, the U.S. warned Russian officials about the possibility of an attack - information that was dismissed by Moscow.\n\nThe SCO is not a collective security or economic alliance, and there are \"significant security differences between its members,\" said Nigel Gould-Davies, a senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia with the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London and a former British ambassador to Belarus. The \"principal value\" of the organization lies in the optics of non-Western countries gathering together, he added.\n\nMr. Gabuev agreed, saying the SCO is a place for conversation rather than a platform where \"collective decisions are made, implemented and have an impact.\"\n\nThis year, close Moscow ally Belarus will become a full member of the organization, and its admission indicates how Russia wants to bolster blocs of non-Western countries. Mr. Gould-Davies said the SCO is raising its profile \"by growing its membership rather than by deepening its cooperation.\"\n\nPolitical differences among some of SCO members - such as India and Pakistan over disputed Kashmir - also make it difficult to reach collective agreement on some issues.\n\nChina has backed Moscow amid the fighting in Ukraine, but at a meeting of the SCO in 2022, Mr. Putin referred to Beijing's unspecified \"concerns\" over the conflict. India's Mr. Modi then called for an end to the fighting without voicing explicit disapproval of Moscow's action.\n\nThe Central Asian countries balance relations with Russia and China while also remaining on good terms with Western nations. None of the five former Soviet republics in Central Asia have publicly backed the war, although all abstained on a U.N. vote condemning it.\n\nMr. Guterres may use the meeting to talk to Mr. Putin about how Russia is \"disrupting the coherence of the U.N.,\" Mr. Gabuev said. Russia has vetoed U.N. Security Council sanctions on monitoring North Korea and a vote on stopping an arms race in outer space.\n\nWith Mr. Guterres unlikely to visit Moscow, the Astana meeting is likely his best chance to speak to Mr. Putin, Mr. Gabuev added.\n\nNeither Ukraine nor any of its Western backers are attending, and major talks - or breakthroughs - on the war are not expected.\n\nBut because it's rare these days for any meeting to include the heads of Russia, China, Turkey, and the U.N., the possibility of talks about the war might be raised, at least on the peripheries of the summit, probably behind closed doors.\n\nThere could be \"a lot of sideline discussions on Ukraine, as it is a big issue which concerns all of us,\" a senior Kazakh official told The Associated Press. The official was not authorized to talk publicly, and thus spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nMr. Gabuev said Mr. Putin will try to show there's a \"big club of countries\" that are \"ambivalent\" toward the war in Ukraine.",

        "body": "LONDON, July 3 (Reuters) - The London Metal Exchange (LME) will suspend the listing of a nickel brand produced by a plant in Finland owned by Russian metals giant Nornickel , it said on Wednesday, without providing a reason for the suspension.\n\nThe decision by the LME, the world's largest and oldest metals trading venue, is related to its responsible sourcing campaign, rather than Russia-related sanctions, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.\n\nThe LME declined to comment. Nornickel did not reply to a Reuters request for comment.\n\nDeliveries of nickel cathodes and briquettes produced by Norilsk Nickel Harjavalta Oy will not be accepted for the LME nickel contract warranting from Oct. 3, the LME said in two separate notices.\n\nThe LME, owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing , said in January it would suspend or delist 10% of its listed metals brands until their producers provided it with their responsible sourcing reports.\n\nHarjavalta, one of the largest nickel refining plants in Europe, is yet to complete its routine responsible minerals audit, one of the sources said, adding that the process was likely to be completed before the LME's Oct. 3 deadline.\n\nThe plant has an annual production capacity of 65,000 metric tons of nickel which it produces from raw materials of Russian or other origin. Nornickel itself produced 209,000 tons of nickel in 2023.\n\nThe LME in April banned from its system all Russian aluminium, copper and nickel produced from April 13 to comply with U.S. and UK sanctions imposed over Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nNornickel's Finnish plant was unaffected by that decision.

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko will be present as his country becomes a full member of NATO.\n\nIran is still choosing a successor to its president Ebrahim Raisikilled in a helicopter crash in May, with a second round election On Friday, interim president Mohammad Mokhbar will be present.\n\nOther SCO guests include Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev.\n\nUN Secretary-General António Guterres, who is visiting Central Asia, will also be present. According to Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, Guterres wants to position the UN as an inclusive organization that engages with all the major clubs.\n\nWhich SCO leaders will not be there?\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has sent his foreign minister. Indian media reported that the new minister was busy with the parliamentary session that began last week. He attended the recent G7 summit in Italy, and some media also reported that he wanted to balance India's relations with Russia and the West.\n\nWhat are their goals ?\n\nPutin wants to show that Russia is not isolated in the face of Western sanctions linked to the invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nAn arrest warrant has been issued against him by the International Criminal Court for war crimes, accusing him of being personally responsible for Child Abductions in UkraineKazakhstan is not a party to the Rome Statute and is therefore not obliged to stop it.\n\nFor Putin, this meeting is a matter of prestige and symbolism, because it shows that he is not alone, Gabuev said.\n\nThe meeting is another opportunity for Putin and Xi to demonstrate the strength of their personal ties as part of their strategic partnership, as both countries face growing tensions with the West. They have met more than 40 times.\n\nPutin's meeting with Xi in May showed how China has offered diplomatic support Russia is a major market for its oil and gas. Russia relies on Beijing as a major source of high-tech imports to power its military machine.\n\nThe SCO helps China project its influence, particularly in Central Asia and neighboring countries. Global SouthLast week, Xi Jinping called for building bridges of communication between countries and wants to further promote China as an alternative to the United States and its allies.\n\nErdogan could use the meeting to hold talks with Vladimir Putin, who has postponed several visits to Turkey. The leader of the NATO member country has maintained balanced relations with Russia and Ukraine since the start of the war, repeatedly offering to play the role of mediator.\n\nFor host Kazakhstan and other Central Asian countries, the meeting is a way to strengthen cooperation with larger, more powerful neighbors. Kazakhstan, for example, engages frequently with Russia and China while also seeking ties with the West, with visits this year by U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and British Foreign Secretary David Cameron.\n\nWhat will be discussed?\n\nThe fight against terrorism is a top priority. Russia has experienced two terrorist attacks this year, with more than 145 people killed by gunmen. Moscow Concert Hall in March, and at least 21 people were killed In June, there were attacks on police and places of worship in the southern republic of Dagestan. During the March violence, the United States warned Russian officials of the possibility of an attack, a report that Moscow denied.\n\nThe SCO is not a collective security or economic alliance, and there are significant security divergences among its members, said Nigel Gould-Davies, a senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London and a former British ambassador to Belarus. The organization's main value lies in its ability to bring together non-Western countries, he added.\n\nGabuev agrees, saying that the SCO is a place for conversation rather than a platform where collective decisions are made, implemented and have an impact.\n\nThis year, Belarus, a close ally of Moscow, will become a full member of the organization, and its admission shows that Russia wants to strengthen non-Western blocs. According to Gould-Davies, the SCO is increasing its profile by increasing its membership rather than by deepening cooperation.\n\nAre there tensions within the SCO?\n\nPolitical differences exist between some SCO members, such as India and Pakistan, over controversial issues. Cashmere This also makes it difficult to reach a collective agreement on certain issues.\n\nChina has supported Moscow in the Ukraine conflict, but at a 2022 SCO meeting, Putin referred to Beijing's unspecified concerns about the conflict. Indian President Modi then called for an end to the fighting without expressing explicit disapproval of Moscow's actions.\n\nCentral Asian countries are balancing their relations with Russia and China while remaining on good terms with Western nationsNone of the five former Soviet republics in Central Asia publicly supported the war, although all abstained from a UN vote condemning it.\n\nGuterres could use the meeting to discuss with Putin how Russia is disrupting the coherence of the UN, Gabuev said. Russia has vetoed UN Security Council sanctions over surveillance of North Korea and a vote on ending the arms race in space.\n\nGiven that Guterres is unlikely to travel to Moscow, the Astana meeting is probably his best chance to talk to Putin, Gabuev added.\n\nWill Ukraine be mentioned?\n\nNeither Ukraine nor any of its Western backers are present, and no major negotiations or major breakthroughs on the war are expected.\n\nBut since it is rare these days for a meeting to include the leaders of Russia, China, Turkey and the UN, the possibility of war discussions could be raised, at least on the periphery of the summit, probably behind closed doors.\n\nThere could be a lot of discussion on the sidelines about Ukraine because it is an important issue that concerns all of us, a senior Kazakh official told The Associated Press. The official was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nGabuev said Putin would try to show that there is a large club of countries that are ambivalent about the war in Ukraine.\n\n-\n\nBurrows reported from London.

        "body": "Astana: The leaders of Russia and China were in Kazakhstan on Wednesday for a regional summit, seeking to harden anti-Western alliances and press their influence in the strategic Central Asian region.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin touched down in the Kazakh capital of Astana Wednesday morning for a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) -- a Beijing-led regional bloc that covers Central Asia, India and Iran.\n\nMoscow and Beijing have deepened their political, military and economic ties since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nAlongside Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who arrived in Kazakhstan on Tuesday, the pair see the SCO as a key forum for advancing their strategic interests across Eurasia.\n\n\"We attach great importance to partnership cooperation within this organisation,\" Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov told Russian state media outlets ahead of Putin's arrival.\n\n\"We believe that the SCO, as well as the second major association of BRICS, are the main pillars of the new world order, a locomotive in the context of establishing genuine multilateralism in world affairs,\" he added.\n\nBoth Russia and China have railed against what they call a US-led \"hegemony\" on the world stage.\n\nChina's foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said earlier this week that Beijing believed the SCO summit would \"help build more consensus among all parties and make contributions to promoting security, stability and development of member countries\", and advance \"lasting peace and common prosperity in the world\".\n\nMoscow and Beijing have been rivals for influence in the Central Asian region.\n\nThe five countries -- Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan -- are ex-Soviet republics and have historic cultural, linguistic and economic ties to Russia.\n\nBut China's rising economic power and sprawling investment in the region has challenged Russian influence.\n\nCentral Asia is crucial to China's flagship Belt and Road international infrastructure development project.\n\nThe region is rich in natural resources and crucial for the overland transport of goods between China and Europe.\n\nRussia's war on Ukraine has also been seen as creating an opening for other powers to swoop into regions that have been traditionally aligned with Moscow.\n\nThe ultra-closed Turkmenistan is not a member of the SCO, but the four others are, alongside India, Iran and Pakistan.\n\nThe nine-member bloc is complemented by 14 \"dialogue partners\", such as Turkey and several Gulf states.\n\nIn a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the summit, Turkiye's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told Putin he was awaiting a visit from him \"as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"I will definitely come,\" Putin said, in the televised exchange.\n\nNATO member Turkey is positioning itself as a possible mediator in the Ukraine war.\n\nThe country is also a key trade and finance centre for Moscow, facing heavy Western sanctions.\n\nPutin said the two countries were developing ties \"despite all the difficulties at the moment in the world.\"\n\nRussia's close ally Belarus is set to join the SCO at the meeting after being told at the 2023 summit that it would become a member.\n\nIn an interview with Kazakh state media, Belarus's President Alexander Lukashenko said the group was \"demonstrating to the world that there are alternative international platforms, different centres of power.\"\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was also set to address the two-day summit on Thursday.",

        "body": "The Russian and Indian foreign ministers held talks on the sidelines of the SCO summit in Astana\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and his Indian counterpart Subrahmanyam Jaishankar held talks on bilateral issues on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Astana, Kazakhstan on Wednesday.\n\nThe top diplomats noted the progress in many areas since their last meeting in December, Jaishankar wrote on X (formerly Twitter). New Delhi and Moscow signed several bilateral agreements during the Indian diplomat's visit last year, when he held meetings with both Lavrov and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe foreign ministers also discussed \"global strategic landscape and exchanged assessments and views\" in Astana, according to Jaishankar.\n\nIndia, which has abstained from UN resolutions condemning Russia over the Ukraine conflict, has repeatedly advocated dialogue and diplomacy to resolve the situation. Last month, an Indian delegation refused to endorse the final document issued after a two-day summit on peace in Ukraine because Russia had not been invited. New Delhi issued a statement, saying a lasting and peaceful resolution required \"sincere and practical engagement between the two parties to the conflict.\"\n\nWednesday's meeting comes days before Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to visit Moscow for a bilateral summit with Putin. On Tuesday, a Kremlin spokesman described the upcoming visit as \"very important.\" The two leaders will discuss regional and global security, bilateral ties, and trade.\n\nOver the past two years, India has ramped up imports of Russian commodities, particularly oil and coal, and strategic goods including defense hardware, despite the pressure of Western sanctions on Moscow.\n\nJaishankar has repeatedly emphasized the importance of maintaining a robust relationship with Russia, explaining that India's foreign policy is guided by \"national interest.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, he said he had raised New Delhi's \"strong concern\" over the presence of Indian nationals in the war zone of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Last month, New Delhi announced that two Indian nationals had been killed and urged its citizens to \"exercise caution\" when being offered well-paid jobs in Russia.\n\nEarlier this year, India's top investigative agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), uncovered a human-trafficking ring that brought young Indians to Russia on the promise of lucrative employment opportunities. The CBI announced in March that it had conducted raids in a number of locations across India and initiated legal proceedings against several visa consultancy firms and agents implicated in the scheme.\n\nThe Indian Foreign Ministry said it had also raised the matter with Moscow, and sought the \"early release and return\" of all Indian nationals who are believed to be fighting for Russia. Moscow, meanwhile, stated that its missions in India and Sri Lanka, which also raised similar concerns over its citizens participating in the conflict, were in constant contact with officials in New Delhi and Colombo over the matter.",

        "title": "Leaders of Russia and China meet at a Central Asian summit in a show of deepening cooperation",
        "body": "Russian President Vladimir Putin, right, and Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan shake hands during their meeting on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Astana, Kazakhstan, Wednesday, July 3, 2024.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping met Wednesday for the second time in as many months as they visited Kazakhstan for a session of an international group founded to counter Western alliances.\n\nPutin and Xi last got together in May when the Kremlin leader visited Beijing to underscore their close partnership that opposes the U.S.-led democratic order and seeks to promote a more \"multipolar\" world.\n\nNow they'll be holding meetings amid the annual session of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization taking place Wednesday and Thursday in the Kazakh capital of Astana. A look at the summit:\n\nWhat is the Shanghai Cooperation Organization?\n\nThe Shanghai Cooperation Organization was established in 2001 by China and Russia to discuss security concerns in Central Asia and the wider region, Other members are Iran, India, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Observer states and dialogue partners include Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.\n\nWho's attending this year?\n\nBesides Putin and Xi, and summit host President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, other leaders there will be Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif of Pakistan, President Shavkat Mirziyoyev of Uzbekistan, President Emomali Rakhmon of Tajikistan, and President Sadyr Zhaparov of Kyrgyzstan. President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus will attend because his nation is becoming a full member.\n\nIran is still choosing a successor to President Ebrahim Raisi, killed in a helicopter crash in May, with a runoff election Friday, so acting President Mohammad Mokhbar will attend.\n\nOther guests of the SCO include President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan.\n\nAlso present will be U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, who is visiting Central Asia. Guterres wants \"to position the U.N. as an inclusive organization that's talking to all the big clubs,\" said Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.\n\nWhat SCO leaders won't be there?\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi of India is sending his foreign minister. Indian media reports speculated the recently reelected Modi was busy with the parliament session that began last week. He attended the recent Group of Seven summit in Italy, and some reports also speculated he wants to balance India's relationship with Russia and the West.\n\nWhat are their goals?\n\nPutin wants to show that Russia isn't isolated over Western sanctions from the invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nAn arrest warrant has been issued for him by the International Criminal Court for war crimes, accusing him of personal responsibility for abductions of children from Ukraine. Kazakhstan is not party to the Rome Statute and thus is not obliged to arrest him.\n\nFor Putin, the meeting is about \"prestige and the symbolic optics that he's not alone,\" Gabuev said.\n\nIndeed, the Russian leader on Wednesday had multiple meetings with other leaders on the sidelines of the summit, all diligently aired by Russian state TV.\n\nAt a meeting with Xi on Wednesday, Putin hailed the SCO as \"one of the key pillars of a fair, multipolar world order,\" and said ties between Moscow and Beijing are \"experiencing the best period in their history.\"\n\nBoth face soaring tensions with the West and have met about 40 times.\n\nTheir meeting in China in May underscored Beijing's diplomatic support for Moscow and how it's a top market for its oil and gas. Russia has relied on Beijing as a main source of high-tech imports to keep its military machine running.\n\nThe SCO helps China project its influence, especially across Central Asia and the Global South. Xi called for \"bridges of communication\" between countries last week and wants to further promote China as an alternative to the U.S. and its allies.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nErdogan also met with Putin, whose expected visits to Turkey haven't materialized. The leader of the NATO member has balanced relations with both Russia and Ukraine since the war began, frequently offering to serve as a mediator.\n\nFor host Kazakhstan and the other Central Asian nations, the meeting is a way to further their cooperation with bigger, more powerful neighbors. Kazakhstan, for instance, frequently engages with both neighboring Russia and China, while also pursuing links with the West, with visits this year from U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and British Foreign Secretary David Cameron.\n\nWhat will be discussed?\n\nCountering terrorism is a key focus. Russia had what it has called two terrorist attacks this year, with more 145 people killed by gunmen at a Moscow concert hall in March, and at least 21 people were killed in attacks on police and houses of worship in the southern republic of Dagestan in June. In the March violence, the U.S. warned Russian officials about the possibility of an attack -- information that was dismissed by Moscow.\n\nThe SCO is not a collective security or economic alliance, and there are \"significant security differences between its members,\" said Nigel Gould-Davies, a senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia with the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London and a former British ambassador to Belarus. The \"principal value\" of the organization lies in the optics of non-Western countries gathering together, he added.\n\nGabuev agreed, saying the SCO is a place for conversation rather than a platform where \"collective decisions are made, implemented and have an impact.\"\n\nThis year, close Moscow ally Belarus will become a full member of the organization, and its admission indicates how Russia wants to bolster blocs of non-Western countries. Gould-Davies said the SCO is raising its profile \"by growing its membership rather than by deepening its cooperation.\"\n\nAre there tensions within the SCO?\n\nPolitical differences among some of SCO members -- such as India and Pakistan over disputed Kashmir -- also make it difficult to reach collective agreement on some issues.\n\nChina has backed Moscow amid the fighting in Ukraine, but at a meeting of the SCO in 2022, Putin referred to Beijing's unspecified \"concerns\" over the conflict. India's Modi then called for an end to the fighting without voicing explicit disapproval of Moscow's action.\n\nThe Central Asian countries balance relations with Russia and China while also remaining on good terms with Western nations. None of the five former Soviet republics in Central Asia have publicly backed the war, although all abstained on a U.N. vote condemning it.\n\nGuterres may use the meeting to talk to Putin about how Russia is \"disrupting the coherence of the U.N.,\" Gabuev said. Russia has vetoed U.N. Security Council sanctions on monitoring North Korea and a vote on stopping an arms race in outer space.\n\nWith Guterres unlikely to visit Moscow, the Astana meeting is likely his best chance to speak to Putin, Gabuev added.\n\nWill Ukraine be discussed?\n\nNeither Ukraine nor any of its Western backers are attending, and major talks -- or breakthroughs -- on the war are not expected.\n\nBut because it's rare these days for any meeting to include the heads of Russia, China, Turkey and the U.N., the possibility of talks about the war might be raised, at least on the peripheries of the summit, probably behind closed doors.\n\nThere could be \"a lot of sideline discussions on Ukraine, as it is a big issue which concerns all of us,\" a senior Kazakh official told The Associated Press. The official was not authorized to talk publicly, and thus spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nGabuev said Putin will try to show there's a \"big club of countries\" that are \"ambivalent\" toward the war in Ukraine.\n\n-- -\n\nBurrows reported from London.

        "body": "Russian President Vladimir Putin, right, and Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan shake hands during their meeting on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Astana, Kazakhstan, Wednesday, July 3, 2024.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping met Wednesday for the second time in as many months as they visited Kazakhstan for a session of an international group founded to counter Western alliances.\n\nPutin and Xi last got together in May when the Kremlin leader visited Beijing to underscore their close partnership that opposes the U.S.-led democratic order and seeks to promote a more \"multipolar\" world.\n\nNow they'll be holding meetings amid the annual session of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization taking place Wednesday and Thursday in the Kazakh capital of Astana. A look at the summit:\n\nWhat is the Shanghai Cooperation Organization?\n\nThe Shanghai Cooperation Organization was established in 2001 by China and Russia to discuss security concerns in Central Asia and the wider region, Other members are Iran, India, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Observer states and dialogue partners include Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.\n\nWho's attending this year?\n\nBesides Putin and Xi, and summit host President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, other leaders there will be Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif of Pakistan, President Shavkat Mirziyoyev of Uzbekistan, President Emomali Rakhmon of Tajikistan, and President Sadyr Zhaparov of Kyrgyzstan. President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus will attend because his nation is becoming a full member.\n\nIran is still choosing a successor to President Ebrahim Raisi, killed in a helicopter crash in May, with a runoff election Friday, so acting President Mohammad Mokhbar will attend.\n\nOther guests of the SCO include President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan.\n\nAlso present will be U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, who is visiting Central Asia. Guterres wants \"to position the U.N. as an inclusive organization that's talking to all the big clubs,\" said Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.\n\nWhat SCO leaders won't be there?\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi of India is sending his foreign minister. Indian media reports speculated the recently reelected Modi was busy with the parliament session that began last week. He attended the recent Group of Seven summit in Italy, and some reports also speculated he wants to balance India's relationship with Russia and the West.\n\nWhat are their goals?\n\nPutin wants to show that Russia isn't isolated over Western sanctions from the invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nAn arrest warrant has been issued for him by the International Criminal Court for war crimes, accusing him of personal responsibility for abductions of children from Ukraine. Kazakhstan is not party to the Rome Statute and thus is not obliged to arrest him.\n\nFor Putin, the meeting is about \"prestige and the symbolic optics that he's not alone,\" Gabuev said.\n\nIndeed, the Russian leader on Wednesday had multiple meetings with other leaders on the sidelines of the summit, all diligently aired by Russian state TV.\n\nAt a meeting with Xi on Wednesday, Putin hailed the SCO as \"one of the key pillars of a fair, multipolar world order,\" and said ties between Moscow and Beijing are \"experiencing the best period in their history.\"\n\nBoth face soaring tensions with the West and have met about 40 times.\n\nTheir meeting in China in May underscored Beijing's diplomatic support for Moscow and how it's a top market for its oil and gas. Russia has relied on Beijing as a main source of high-tech imports to keep its military machine running.\n\nThe SCO helps China project its influence, especially across Central Asia and the Global South. Xi called for \"bridges of communication\" between countries last week and wants to further promote China as an alternative to the U.S. and its allies.\n\nErdogan also met with Putin, whose expected visits to Turkey haven't materialized. The leader of the NATO member has balanced relations with both Russia and Ukraine since the war began, frequently offering to serve as a mediator.\n\nFor host Kazakhstan and the other Central Asian nations, the meeting is a way to further their cooperation with bigger, more powerful neighbors. Kazakhstan, for instance, frequently engages with both neighboring Russia and China, while also pursuing links with the West, with visits this year from U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and British Foreign Secretary David Cameron.\n\nWhat will be discussed?\n\nCountering terrorism is a key focus. Russia had what it has called two terrorist attacks this year, with more 145 people killed by gunmen at a Moscow concert hall in March, and at least 21 people were killed in attacks on police and houses of worship in the southern republic of Dagestan in June. In the March violence, the U.S. warned Russian officials about the possibility of an attack -- information that was dismissed by Moscow.\n\nThe SCO is not a collective security or economic alliance, and there are \"significant security differences between its members,\" said Nigel Gould-Davies, a senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia with the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London and a former British ambassador to Belarus. The \"principal value\" of the organization lies in the optics of non-Western countries gathering together, he added.\n\nGabuev agreed, saying the SCO is a place for conversation rather than a platform where \"collective decisions are made, implemented and have an impact.\"\n\nThis year, close Moscow ally Belarus will become a full member of the organization, and its admission indicates how Russia wants to bolster blocs of non-Western countries. Gould-Davies said the SCO is raising its profile \"by growing its membership rather than by deepening its cooperation.\"\n\nAre there tensions within the SCO?\n\nPolitical differences among some of SCO members -- such as India and Pakistan over disputed Kashmir -- also make it difficult to reach collective agreement on some issues.\n\nChina has backed Moscow amid the fighting in Ukraine, but at a meeting of the SCO in 2022, Putin referred to Beijing's unspecified \"concerns\" over the conflict. India's Modi then called for an end to the fighting without voicing explicit disapproval of Moscow's action.\n\nThe Central Asian countries balance relations with Russia and China while also remaining on good terms with Western nations. None of the five former Soviet republics in Central Asia have publicly backed the war, although all abstained on a U.N. vote condemning it.\n\nGuterres may use the meeting to talk to Putin about how Russia is \"disrupting the coherence of the U.N.,\" Gabuev said. Russia has vetoed U.N. Security Council sanctions on monitoring North Korea and a vote on stopping an arms race in outer space.\n\nWith Guterres unlikely to visit Moscow, the Astana meeting is likely his best chance to speak to Putin, Gabuev added.\n\nWill Ukraine be discussed?\n\nNeither Ukraine nor any of its Western backers are attending, and major talks -- or breakthroughs -- on the war are not expected.\n\nBut because it's rare these days for any meeting to include the heads of Russia, China, Turkey and the U.N., the possibility of talks about the war might be raised, at least on the peripheries of the summit, probably behind closed doors.\n\nThere could be \"a lot of sideline discussions on Ukraine, as it is a big issue which concerns all of us,\" a senior Kazakh official told The Associated Press. The official was not authorized to talk publicly, and thus spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nGabuev said Putin will try to show there's a \"big club of countries\" that are \"ambivalent\" toward the war in Ukraine.\n\n-- -\n\nBurrows reported from London.

July 3 (Interfax) - The ruble exchange rate's equilibrium against the yuan and dollar will be restored gradually, and there is no risk of yuan trading being suspended in Russia, Sberbank CEO Herman Gref told reporters on the sidelines of the Bank of Russia Financial Congress.\n\n\"I don't see it,\" he said, when asked whether there are any risks yuan trading might be suspended in Russia due to possible secondary sanctions.\n\nAnswering the same question, the head of VTB Andrei Kostin said: \"I think that the yuan will still be used widely in trade between Russia and perhaps not only China, but how this will be organized is another question.\"\n\nThe United States on June 12 added the Moscow Exchange and its group members National Clearing Center (NCC) and National Settlement Depository (NSD) to its sanctions list. This caused exchange trading in the dollar and euro to be suspended. Transactions with these currencies continue on the OTC market, data from which is used to calculate official dollar and euro exchange rates.\n\nGref said he believed the official rate was now representative.\n\n\"There has always been an OTC market, and up to 60% of trading always took place on the exchange market. Now the volume is of course greater, and accordingly, the exchange rate will be fairly representative. All mechanisms are gradual, and the exchange rate against the yuan and dollar will balance out gradually. I don't see any calamity here,\" Gref said.",

        "title": "Leaders of Russia and China meet at a Central Asian summit in a show of deepening cooperation",
        "body": "Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping have met for the second time in as many months as they visit Kazakhstan for a session of an international group founded to counter Western alliances\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping met Wednesday for the second time in as many months as they visited Kazakhstan for a session of an international group founded to counter Western alliances.\n\nPutin and Xi last got together in May when the Kremlin leader visited Beijing to underscore their close partnership that opposes the U.S.-led democratic order and seeks to promote a more \"multipolar\" world.\n\nNow they'll be holding meetings amid the annual session of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization taking place Wednesday and Thursday in the Kazakh capital of Astana. A look at the summit:\n\nWhat is the Shanghai Cooperation Organization?\n\nThe Shanghai Cooperation Organization was established in 2001 by China and Russia to discuss security concerns in Central Asia and the wider region, Other members are Iran, India, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Observer states and dialogue partners include Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.\n\nWho's attending this year?\n\nBesides Putin and Xi, and summit host President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, other leaders there will be Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif of Pakistan, President Shavkat Mirziyoyev of Uzbekistan, President Emomali Rakhmon of Tajikistan, and President Sadyr Zhaparov of Kyrgyzstan. President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus will attend because his nation is becoming a full member.\n\nIran is still choosing a successor to President Ebrahim Raisi, killed in a helicopter crash in May, with a runoff election Friday, so acting President Mohammad Mokhbar will attend.\n\nOther guests of the SCO include President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan.\n\nAlso present will be U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, who is visiting Central Asia. Guterres wants \"to position the U.N. as an inclusive organization that's talking to all the big clubs,\" said Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.\n\nWhat SCO leaders won't be there?\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi of India is sending his foreign minister. Indian media reports speculated the recently reelected Modi was busy with the parliament session that began last week. He attended the recent Group of Seven summit in Italy, and some reports also speculated he wants to balance India's relationship with Russia and the West.\n\nWhat are their goals?\n\nPutin wants to show that Russia isn't isolated over Western sanctions from the invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nAn arrest warrant has been issued for him by the International Criminal Court for war crimes, accusing him of personal responsibility for abductions of children from Ukraine. Kazakhstan is not party to the Rome Statute and thus is not obliged to arrest him.\n\nFor Putin, the meeting is about \"prestige and the symbolic optics that he's not alone,\" Gabuev said.\n\nIndeed, the Russian leader on Wednesday had multiple meetings with other leaders on the sidelines of the summit, all diligently aired by Russian state TV.\n\nAt a meeting with Xi on Wednesday, Putin hailed the SCO as \"one of the key pillars of a fair, multipolar world order,\" and said ties between Moscow and Beijing are \"experiencing the best period in their history.\"\n\nBoth face soaring tensions with the West and have met about 40 times.\n\nTheir meeting in China in May underscored Beijing's diplomatic support for Moscow and how it's a top market for its oil and gas. Russia has relied on Beijing as a main source of high-tech imports to keep its military machine running.\n\nThe SCO helps China project its influence, especially across Central Asia and the Global South. Xi called for \"bridges of communication\" between countries last week and wants to further promote China as an alternative to the U.S. and its allies.\n\nErdogan also met with Putin, whose expected visits to Turkey haven't materialized. The leader of the NATO member has balanced relations with both Russia and Ukraine since the war began, frequently offering to serve as a mediator.\n\nFor host Kazakhstan and the other Central Asian nations, the meeting is a way to further their cooperation with bigger, more powerful neighbors. Kazakhstan, for instance, frequently engages with both neighboring Russia and China, while also pursuing links with the West, with visits this year from U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and British Foreign Secretary David Cameron.\n\nWhat will be discussed?\n\nCountering terrorism is a key focus. Russia had what it has called two terrorist attacks this year, with more 145 people killed by gunmen at a Moscow concert hall in March, and at least 21 people were killed in attacks on police and houses of worship in the southern republic of Dagestan in June. In the March violence, the U.S. warned Russian officials about the possibility of an attack -- information that was dismissed by Moscow.\n\nThe SCO is not a collective security or economic alliance, and there are \"significant security differences between its members,\" said Nigel Gould-Davies, a senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia with the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London and a former British ambassador to Belarus. The \"principal value\" of the organization lies in the optics of non-Western countries gathering together, he added.\n\nGabuev agreed, saying the SCO is a place for conversation rather than a platform where \"collective decisions are made, implemented and have an impact.\"\n\nThis year, close Moscow ally Belarus will become a full member of the organization, and its admission indicates how Russia wants to bolster blocs of non-Western countries. Gould-Davies said the SCO is raising its profile \"by growing its membership rather than by deepening its cooperation.\"\n\nAre there tensions within the SCO?\n\nPolitical differences among some of SCO members -- such as India and Pakistan over disputed Kashmir -- also make it difficult to reach collective agreement on some issues.\n\nChina has backed Moscow amid the fighting in Ukraine, but at a meeting of the SCO in 2022, Putin referred to Beijing's unspecified \"concerns\" over the conflict. India's Modi then called for an end to the fighting without voicing explicit disapproval of Moscow's action.\n\nThe Central Asian countries balance relations with Russia and China while also remaining on good terms with Western nations. None of the five former Soviet republics in Central Asia have publicly backed the war, although all abstained on a U.N. vote condemning it.\n\nGuterres may use the meeting to talk to Putin about how Russia is \"disrupting the coherence of the U.N.,\" Gabuev said. Russia has vetoed U.N. Security Council sanctions on monitoring North Korea and a vote on stopping an arms race in outer space.\n\nWith Guterres unlikely to visit Moscow, the Astana meeting is likely his best chance to speak to Putin, Gabuev added.\n\nWill Ukraine be discussed?\n\nNeither Ukraine nor any of its Western backers are attending, and major talks -- or breakthroughs -- on the war are not expected.\n\nBut because it's rare these days for any meeting to include the heads of Russia, China, Turkey and the U.N., the possibility of talks about the war might be raised, at least on the peripheries of the summit, probably behind closed doors.\n\nThere could be \"a lot of sideline discussions on Ukraine, as it is a big issue which concerns all of us,\" a senior Kazakh official told The Associated Press. The official was not authorized to talk publicly, and thus spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nGabuev said Putin will try to show there's a \"big club of countries\" that are \"ambivalent\" toward the war in Ukraine.\n\n-- -\n\nBurrows reported from London.

        "title": "Orban calls for quick ceasefire to speed up Ukraine peace talks",
        "body": "KYIV: Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban urged Kyiv on Tuesday to work towards a \"quick ceasefire\" in Ukraine that could pave the way for negotiations with Russia to end more than two years of war. Orban issued the appeal standing next to President Volodymyr Zelensky during a surprise visit to Ukraine, the first by the vocal critic of Western support for Kyiv.\n\n\"I asked the president to consider whether... a quick ceasefire could speed up the peace talks,\" the Hungarian leader told reporters with Zelensky, adding that the ceasefire he envisions would be \"time-limited\". Unlike many other European leaders, Orban had not visited Kyiv since Russia invaded in February 2022 and has publicly hit out at Europe's financial and military aid, temporarily blocking a 50-billion-euro ($53-billion) aid package for weeks.\n\nThe nationalist leader has also blasted the EU's move to open formal membership talks with Kyiv -- though he abstained rather than vetoing it -- and has been accused of maintaining warm relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Orban, in power since 2010, met with Putin in October 2023 at a regional summit in Beijing, becoming the first EU leader to do so since the start of the war.\n\nHungary openly opposes sanctions on Russia, though has so far only sought to hold up the EU's measures, not outright block them. The Kremlin said earlier Tuesday it expected little to come of the visit but described Orban as a \"tough\" politician who keenly defended his country's interests.\n\nThe visit to Ukraine comes the day after Hungary took over the EU's rotating presidency for the next six months, a position which gives the central European state sway over the bloc's agenda and priorities for the rest of the year. Orban said he would report on his talks with Zelensky to EU prime ministers \"so that the necessary European decisions can be taken.\"\n\nZelensky said the timing of the visit, after Hungary took over EU presidency, was symbolic.\n\n\"This is a clear indication of our common European priorities, of how important it is to bring a just peace to Ukraine,\" he said, urging European countries to maintain military support.\n\nDespite sharing a border with Ukraine, Hungary has also taken in significantly fewer refugees than most EU members. Orban's visit came as Russian forces killed one person and wounded seven more in the southern Kherson region, which is partially occupied.\n\nMoscow has claimed the capture of a string of villages in eastern Ukraine in recent weeks.\n\nRelations have been frosty between Orban and Zelensky since the start of the war. After winning re-election in April 2022, Orban said the Ukrainian leader was an \"opponent\" that he had managed to defeat in the campaign. Zelensky had personally called out Orban for his lack of support to Kyiv in the days after Russia invaded -- a position that has only appeared to harden with the war now in its third year.\n\nIn December, Zelensky sought out the Hungarian leader at the inauguration of Argentine President Javier Milei for what he called a \"frank\" conversation. Videos circulated online showing the pair locked in a tense exchange, with Orban standing with his back to the wall and Zelensky in front of him. - AFP",

        "title": "Leaders of Russia and China meet at a Central Asian summit in a show of deepening cooperation",
        "body": "Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping met Wednesday for the second time in as many months as they visited Kazakhstan for a session of an international group founded to counter Western alliances.\n\nPutin and Xi last got together in May when the Kremlin leader visited Beijing to underscore their close partnership that opposes the U.S.-led democratic order and seeks to promote a more \"multipolar\" world.\n\nNow they'll be holding meetings amid the annual session of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization taking place Wednesday and Thursday in the Kazakh capital of Astana. A look at the summit:\n\nThe Shanghai Cooperation Organization was established in 2001 by China and Russia to discuss security concerns in Central Asia and the wider region, Other members are Iran, India, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Observer states and dialogue partners include Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.\n\nBesides Putin and Xi, and summit host President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, other leaders there will be Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif of Pakistan, President Shavkat Mirziyoyev of Uzbekistan, President Emomali Rakhmon of Tajikistan, and President Sadyr Zhaparov of Kyrgyzstan. President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus will attend because his nation is becoming a full member.\n\nIran is still choosing a successor to President Ebrahim Raisi, killed in a helicopter crash in May, with a runoff election Friday, so acting President Mohammad Mokhbar will attend.\n\nOther guests of the SCO include President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan.\n\nAlso present will be U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, who is visiting Central Asia. Guterres wants \"to position the U.N. as an inclusive organization that's talking to all the big clubs,\" said Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi of India is sending his foreign minister. Indian media reports speculated the recently reelected Modi was busy with the parliament session that began last week. He attended the recent Group of Seven summit in Italy, and some reports also speculated he wants to balance India's relationship with Russia and the West.\n\nPutin wants to show that Russia isn't isolated over Western sanctions from the invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nAn arrest warrant has been issued for him by the International Criminal Court for war crimes, accusing him of personal responsibility for abductions of children from Ukraine. Kazakhstan is not party to the Rome Statute and thus is not obliged to arrest him.\n\nFor Putin, the meeting is about \"prestige and the symbolic optics that he's not alone,\" Gabuev said.\n\nIndeed, the Russian leader on Wednesday had multiple meetings with other leaders on the sidelines of the summit, all diligently aired by Russian state TV.\n\nAt a meeting with Xi on Wednesday, Putin hailed the SCO as \"one of the key pillars of a fair, multipolar world order,\" and said ties between Moscow and Beijing are \"experiencing the best period in their history.\"\n\nBoth face soaring tensions with the West and have met about 40 times.\n\nTheir meeting in China in May underscored Beijing's diplomatic support for Moscow and how it's a top market for its oil and gas. Russia has relied on Beijing as a main source of high-tech imports to keep its military machine running.\n\nThe SCO helps China project its influence, especially across Central Asia and the Global South. Xi called for \"bridges of communication\" between countries last week and wants to further promote China as an alternative to the U.S. and its allies.\n\nErdogan also met with Putin, whose expected visits to Turkey haven't materialized. The leader of the NATO member has balanced relations with both Russia and Ukraine since the war began, frequently offering to serve as a mediator.\n\nFor host Kazakhstan and the other Central Asian nations, the meeting is a way to further their cooperation with bigger, more powerful neighbors. Kazakhstan, for instance, frequently engages with both neighboring Russia and China, while also pursuing links with the West, with visits this year from U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and British Foreign Secretary David Cameron.\n\nCountering terrorism is a key focus. Russia had what it has called two terrorist attacks this year, with more 145 people killed by gunmen at a Moscow concert hall in March, and at least 21 people were killed in attacks on police and houses of worship in the southern republic of Dagestan in June. In the March violence, the U.S. warned Russian officials about the possibility of an attack -- information that was dismissed by Moscow.\n\nThe SCO is not a collective security or economic alliance, and there are \"significant security differences between its members,\" said Nigel Gould-Davies, a senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia with the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London and a former British ambassador to Belarus. The \"principal value\" of the organization lies in the optics of non-Western countries gathering together, he added.\n\nGabuev agreed, saying the SCO is a place for conversation rather than a platform where \"collective decisions are made, implemented and have an impact.\"\n\nThis year, close Moscow ally Belarus will become a full member of the organization, and its admission indicates how Russia wants to bolster blocs of non-Western countries. Gould-Davies said the SCO is raising its profile \"by growing its membership rather than by deepening its cooperation.\"\n\nPolitical differences among some of SCO members -- such as India and Pakistan over disputed Kashmir -- also make it difficult to reach collective agreement on some issues.\n\nChina has backed Moscow amid the fighting in Ukraine, but at a meeting of the SCO in 2022, Putin referred to Beijing's unspecified \"concerns\" over the conflict. India's Modi then called for an end to the fighting without voicing explicit disapproval of Moscow's action.\n\nThe Central Asian countries balance relations with Russia and China while also remaining on good terms with Western nations. None of the five former Soviet republics in Central Asia have publicly backed the war, although all abstained on a U.N. vote condemning it.\n\nGuterres may use the meeting to talk to Putin about how Russia is \"disrupting the coherence of the U.N.,\" Gabuev said. Russia has vetoed U.N. Security Council sanctions on monitoring North Korea and a vote on stopping an arms race in outer space.\n\nWith Guterres unlikely to visit Moscow, the Astana meeting is likely his best chance to speak to Putin, Gabuev added.\n\nNeither Ukraine nor any of its Western backers are attending, and major talks -- or breakthroughs -- on the war are not expected.\n\nBut because it's rare these days for any meeting to include the heads of Russia, China, Turkey and the U.N., the possibility of talks about the war might be raised, at least on the peripheries of the summit, probably behind closed doors.\n\nThere could be \"a lot of sideline discussions on Ukraine, as it is a big issue which concerns all of us,\" a senior Kazakh official told The Associated Press. The official was not authorized to talk publicly, and thus spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nGabuev said Putin will try to show there's a \"big club of countries\" that are \"ambivalent\" toward the war in Ukraine.\n\n-- -\n\nBurrows reported from London.

Russia had what it has called two terrorist attacks this year, with more 145 people killed by gunmen at a Moscow concert hall in March, and at least 21 people were killed in attacks on police and houses of worship in the southern republic of Dagestan in June. In the March violence, the U.S. warned Russian officials about the possibility of an attack -- information that was dismissed by Moscow.\n\nThe SCO is not a collective security or economic alliance, and there are \"significant security differences between its members,\" said Nigel Gould-Davies, a senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia with the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London and a former British ambassador to Belarus. The \"principal value\" of the organization lies in the optics of non-Western countries gathering together, he added.\n\nGabuev agreed, saying the SCO is a place for conversation rather than a platform where \"collective decisions are made, implemented and have an impact.\"\n\nThis year, close Moscow ally Belarus will become a full member of the organization, and its admission indicates how Russia wants to bolster blocs of non-Western countries. Gould-Davies said the SCO is raising its profile \"by growing its membership rather than by deepening its cooperation.\"\n\nAre there tensions within the SCO?\n\nPolitical differences among some of SCO members -- such as India and Pakistan over disputed Kashmir -- also make it difficult to reach collective agreement on some issues.\n\nChina has backed Moscow amid the fighting in Ukraine, but at a meeting of the SCO in 2022, Putin referred to Beijing's unspecified \"concerns\" over the conflict. India's Modi then called for an end to the fighting without voicing explicit disapproval of Moscow's action.\n\nThe Central Asian countries balance relations with Russia and China while also remaining on good terms with Western nations. None of the five former Soviet republics in Central Asia have publicly backed the war, although all abstained on a U.N. vote condemning it.\n\nGuterres may use the meeting to talk to Putin about how Russia is \"disrupting the coherence of the U.N.,\" Gabuev said. Russia has vetoed U.N. Security Council sanctions on monitoring North Korea and a vote on stopping an arms race in outer space.\n\nWith Guterres unlikely to visit Moscow, the Astana meeting is likely his best chance to speak to Putin, Gabuev added.\n\nWill Ukraine be discussed?\n\nNeither Ukraine nor any of its Western backers are attending, and major talks -- or breakthroughs -- on the war are not expected.\n\nBut because it's rare these days for any meeting to include the heads of Russia, China, Turkey and the U.N., the possibility of talks about the war might be raised, at least on the peripheries of the summit, probably behind closed doors.\n\nThere could be \"a lot of sideline discussions on Ukraine, as it is a big issue which concerns all of us,\" a senior Kazakh official told The Associated Press. The official was not authorized to talk publicly, and thus spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nGabuev said Putin will try to show there's a \"big club of countries\" that are \"ambivalent\" toward the war in Ukraine.\n\n-- -\n\nBurrows reported from London.

But his attendance at the G-7 summit last month - an international group that India is not a member of - has sparked speculation that the decision not to attend was made due to Modi's attempt to walk a geopolitical tight rope.\n\nNations like Kazakhstan will use the SCO conference to bolster economic and political ties with their neighboring nations.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPutin is expected to use the meetup as another opportunity to show that Russia is not isolated from the international community despite Western sanctions and global rebuke over the war in Ukraine.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General António Guterres will also be in attendance to continue communications with all major world players.",

        "body": "The Russian and Indian foreign ministers held talks on the sidelines of the SCO summit in Astana\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and his Indian counterpart Subrahmanyam Jaishankar held talks on bilateral issues on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Astana, Kazakhstan on Wednesday.\n\nThe top diplomats noted the progress in many areas since their last meeting in December, Jaishankar wrote on X (formerly Twitter). New Delhi and Moscow signed several bilateral agreements during the Indian diplomat's visit last year, when he held meetings with both Lavrov and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe foreign ministers also discussed \"global strategic landscape and exchanged assessments and views\" in Astana, according to Jaishankar.\n\nIndia, which has abstained from UN resolutions condemning Russia over the Ukraine conflict, has repeatedly advocated dialogue and diplomacy to resolve the situation. Last month, an Indian delegation refused to endorse the final document issued after a two-day summit on peace in Ukraine because Russia had not been invited. New Delhi issued a statement, saying a lasting and peaceful resolution required \"sincere and practical engagement between the two parties to the conflict.\"\n\nWednesday's meeting comes days before Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to visit Moscow for a bilateral summit with Putin. On Tuesday, a Kremlin spokesman described the upcoming visit as \"very important.\" The two leaders will discuss regional and global security, bilateral ties, and trade.\n\nOver the past two years, India has ramped up imports of Russian commodities, particularly oil and coal, and strategic goods including defense hardware, despite the pressure of Western sanctions on Moscow.\n\nJaishankar has repeatedly emphasized the importance of maintaining a robust relationship with Russia, explaining that India's foreign policy is guided by \"national interest.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, he said he had raised New Delhi's \"strong concern\" over the presence of Indian nationals in the war zone of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Last month, New Delhi announced that two Indian nationals had been killed and urged its citizens to \"exercise caution\" when being offered well-paid jobs in Russia.\n\nEarlier this year, India's top investigative agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), uncovered a human-trafficking ring that brought young Indians to Russia on the promise of lucrative employment opportunities. The CBI announced in March that it had conducted raids in a number of locations across India and initiated legal proceedings against several visa consultancy firms and agents implicated in the scheme.\n\nThe Indian Foreign Ministry said it had also raised the matter with Moscow, and sought the \"early release and return\" of all Indian nationals who are believed to be fighting for Russia. Moscow, meanwhile, stated that its missions in India and Sri Lanka, which also raised similar concerns over its citizens participating in the conflict, were in constant contact with officials in New Delhi and Colombo over the matter.",

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nNow they'll be holding meetings amid the annual session of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization taking place Wednesday and Thursday in the Kazakh capital of Astana. A look at the summit:\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWhat is the Shanghai Cooperation Organization?\n\nThe Shanghai Cooperation Organization was established in 2001 by China and Russia to discuss security concerns in Central Asia and the wider region, Other members are Iran, India, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Observer states and dialogue partners include Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.\n\nWho's attending this year?\n\nBesides Putin and Xi, and summit host President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, other leaders there will be Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif of Pakistan, President Shavkat Mirziyoyev of Uzbekistan, President Emomali Rakhmon of Tajikistan, and President Sadyr Zhaparov of Kyrgyzstan. President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus will attend because his nation is becoming a full member.\n\nIran is still choosing a successor to President Ebrahim Raisi, killed in a helicopter crash in May, with a runoff election Friday, so acting President Mohammad Mokhbar will attend.\n\nOther guests of the SCO include President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan.\n\nAlso present will be U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, who is visiting Central Asia. Guterres wants \"to position the U.N. as an inclusive organization that's talking to all the big clubs,\" said Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWhat SCO leaders won't be there?\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi of India is sending his foreign minister. Indian media reports speculated the recently reelected Modi was busy with the parliament session that began last week. He attended the recent Group of Seven summit in Italy, and some reports also speculated he wants to balance India's relationship with Russia and the West.\n\nWhat are their goals?\n\nPutin wants to show that Russia isn't isolated over Western sanctions from the invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nAn arrest warrant has been issued for him by the International Criminal Court for war crimes, accusing him of personal responsibility for abductions of children from Ukraine. Kazakhstan is not party to the Rome Statute and thus is not obliged to arrest him.\n\nFor Putin, the meeting is about \"prestige and the symbolic optics that he's not alone,\" Gabuev said.\n\nIndeed, the Russian leader on Wednesday had multiple meetings with other leaders on the sidelines of the summit, all diligently aired by Russian state TV.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAt a meeting with Xi on Wednesday, Putin hailed the SCO as \"one of the key pillars of a fair, multipolar world order,\" and said ties between Moscow and Beijing are \"experiencing the best period in their history.\"\n\nBoth face soaring tensions with the West and have met about 40 times.\n\nTheir meeting in China in May underscored Beijing's diplomatic support for Moscow and how it's a top market for its oil and gas. Russia has relied on Beijing as a main source of high-tech imports to keep its military machine running.\n\nThe SCO helps China project its influence, especially across Central Asia and the Global South. Xi called for \"bridges of communication\" between countries last week and wants to further promote China as an alternative to the U.S. and its allies.\n\nErdogan also met with Putin, whose expected visits to Turkey haven't materialized. The leader of the NATO member has balanced relations with both Russia and Ukraine since the war began, frequently offering to serve as a mediator.\n\nFor host Kazakhstan and the other Central Asian nations, the meeting is a way to further their cooperation with bigger, more powerful neighbors.

        "body": "Sanctions have forced Russia's biggest private airline to decommission some of its planes, while the country's national carrier has delayed flights because of staffing shortages, it has been reported.\n\nThe woes faced by S7 Airlines and Aeroflot are the latest blow to Russian civil aviation since the start of Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, as a government official warned that passenger numbers in Russia will slump.\n\nThe head of Russia's federal air transport agency, Rosaviatsia, Dmitry Yadrov, said that S7 Airlines will decommission its fleet of Airbus A320neo aircraft because sanctions have made it impossible to repair and maintain their U.S.-made Pratt & Whitney engines.\n\nS7 Airlines has 28 A320neos in its 101-strong fleet, according to SimpleFlying.com.\n\nYadrov said that passenger traffic in Russia would shrink this year to 98.1 million passengers from last year's 105 million and that much depends on what S7 does with its withdrawn aircraft, state news agency Tass reported.\n\n\"These aircraft carry a significant amount of passengers, but the operation of these engines requires increased attention,\" said Yadrov.\n\nAlso known as Siberia Airlines, S7 is headquartered in Novosibirsk. Its membership of the Oneworld alliance of international carriers was suspended due to Putin's invasion and it was among the Russian airlines banned from the airspace of the EU and other countries.\n\nS7 has been beset with problems over the course of the war, which include having to suspend all international flights at one point, and the owner of the aircraft it leases, AerCap, looking to repossess some of its planes.\n\nIn October 2023, S7's problems finding spare parts for engines and servicing reduced the number of its operational Airbus aircraft to around 13, or only one-fifth of its Airbus fleet.\n\nBusiness newspaper Kommersant reported that S7 Airlines will cut its upcoming winter schedule by up to 15 percent due to aircraft maintenance issues.\n\nMeanwhile, the national carrier Aeroflot is having problems of its own due to a shortage of crew that has caused flight delays, according to Telegram channel Baza, which is linked to Russia's authorities.\n\nThe channel said 330 flights were delayed last weekend and 20 canceled, with planes forced to fly with reduced crews. Baza said that last-minute changes to staffing have seen, in some instances, flight attendants boarding after the passengers.\n\nMore than 1,500 staff called in sick due to unhappiness with the management over scheduling, which called on many to work more than the normal 90 in-flight hours per month and a lack of leave, according to the Telegram channel Aviatorshina (Aviators).\n\nAeroflot has denied the reports and said that it had enough flight attendants and pilots to carry out its schedule, state news agency RIA Novosti reported.",

        "title": "Leaders of Russia and China meet at a Central Asian summit in a show of deepening cooperation",
        "body": "Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping met Wednesday for the second time in as many months as they visited Kazakhstan for a session of an international group founded to counter Western alliances.\n\nPutin and Xi last got together in May when the Kremlin leader visited Beijing to underscore their close partnership that opposes the U.S.-led democratic order and seeks to promote a more \"multipolar\" world.\n\nNow they'll be holding meetings amid the annual session of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization taking place Wednesday and Thursday in the Kazakh capital of Astana. A look at the summit:\n\nWhat is the Shanghai Cooperation Organization?\n\nThe Shanghai Cooperation Organization was established in 2001 by China and Russia to discuss security concerns in Central Asia and the wider region, Other members are Iran, India, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Observer states and dialogue partners include Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.\n\nWho's attending this year?\n\nBesides Putin and Xi, and summit host President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, other leaders there will be Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif of Pakistan, President Shavkat Mirziyoyev of Uzbekistan, President Emomali Rakhmon of Tajikistan, and President Sadyr Zhaparov of Kyrgyzstan. President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus will attend because his nation is becoming a full member.\n\nIran is still choosing a successor to President Ebrahim Raisi, killed in a helicopter crash in May, with a runoff election Friday, so acting President Mohammad Mokhbar will attend.\n\nOther guests of the SCO include President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan.\n\nAlso present will be U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, who is visiting Central Asia. Guterres wants \"to position the U.N. as an inclusive organization that's talking to all the big clubs,\" said Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.\n\nWhat SCO leaders won't be there?\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi of India is sending his foreign minister. Indian media reports speculated the recently reelected Modi was busy with the parliament session that began last week. He attended the recent Group of Seven summit in Italy, and some reports also speculated he wants to balance India's relationship with Russia and the West.\n\nWhat are their goals?\n\nPutin wants to show that Russia isn't isolated over Western sanctions from the invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nAn arrest warrant has been issued for him by the International Criminal Court for war crimes, accusing him of personal responsibility for abductions of children from Ukraine. Kazakhstan is not party to the Rome Statute and thus is not obliged to arrest him.\n\nFor Putin, the meeting is about \"prestige and the symbolic optics that he's not alone,\" Gabuev said.\n\nIndeed, the Russian leader on Wednesday had multiple meetings with other leaders on the sidelines of the summit, all diligently aired by Russian state TV.\n\nAt a meeting with Xi on Wednesday, Putin hailed the SCO as \"one of the key pillars of a fair, multipolar world order,\" and said ties between Moscow and Beijing are \"experiencing the best period in their history.\"\n\nBoth face soaring tensions with the West and have met about 40 times.\n\nTheir meeting in China in May underscored Beijing's diplomatic support for Moscow and how it's a top market for its oil and gas. Russia has relied on Beijing as a main source of high-tech imports to keep its military machine running.\n\nThe SCO helps China project its influence, especially across Central Asia and the Global South. Xi called for \"bridges of communication\" between countries last week and wants to further promote China as an alternative to the U.S. and its allies.\n\nErdogan also met with Putin, whose expected visits to Turkey haven't materialized. The leader of the NATO member has balanced relations with both Russia and Ukraine since the war began, frequently offering to serve as a mediator.\n\nFor host Kazakhstan and the other Central Asian nations, the meeting is a way to further their cooperation with bigger, more powerful neighbors. Kazakhstan, for instance, frequently engages with both neighboring Russia and China, while also pursuing links with the West, with visits this year from U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and British Foreign Secretary David Cameron.\n\nWhat will be discussed?\n\nCountering terrorism is a key focus. Russia had what it has called two terrorist attacks this year, with more 145 people killed by gunmen at a Moscow concert hall in March, and at least 21 people were killed in attacks on police and houses of worship in the southern republic of Dagestan in June. In the March violence, the U.S. warned Russian officials about the possibility of an attack -- information that was dismissed by Moscow.\n\nThe SCO is not a collective security or economic alliance, and there are \"significant security differences between its members,\" said Nigel Gould-Davies, a senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia with the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London and a former British ambassador to Belarus. The \"principal value\" of the organization lies in the optics of non-Western countries gathering together, he added.\n\nGabuev agreed, saying the SCO is a place for conversation rather than a platform where \"collective decisions are made, implemented and have an impact.\"\n\nThis year, close Moscow ally Belarus will become a full member of the organization, and its admission indicates how Russia wants to bolster blocs of non-Western countries. Gould-Davies said the SCO is raising its profile \"by growing its membership rather than by deepening its cooperation.\"\n\nAre there tensions within the SCO?\n\nPolitical differences among some of SCO members -- such as India and Pakistan over disputed Kashmir -- also make it difficult to reach collective agreement on some issues.\n\nChina has backed Moscow amid the fighting in Ukraine, but at a meeting of the SCO in 2022, Putin referred to Beijing's unspecified \"concerns\" over the conflict. India's Modi then called for an end to the fighting without voicing explicit disapproval of Moscow's action.\n\nThe Central Asian countries balance relations with Russia and China while also remaining on good terms with Western nations. None of the five former Soviet republics in Central Asia have publicly backed the war, although all abstained on a U.N. vote condemning it.\n\nGuterres may use the meeting to talk to Putin about how Russia is \"disrupting the coherence of the U.N.,\" Gabuev said. Russia has vetoed U.N. Security Council sanctions on monitoring North Korea and a vote on stopping an arms race in outer space.\n\nWith Guterres unlikely to visit Moscow, the Astana meeting is likely his best chance to speak to Putin, Gabuev added.\n\nWill Ukraine be discussed?\n\nNeither Ukraine nor any of its Western backers are attending, and major talks -- or breakthroughs -- on the war are not expected.\n\nBut because it's rare these days for any meeting to include the heads of Russia, China, Turkey and the U.N., the possibility of talks about the war might be raised, at least on the peripheries of the summit, probably behind closed doors.\n\nThere could be \"a lot of sideline discussions on Ukraine, as it is a big issue which concerns all of us,\" a senior Kazakh official told The Associated Press. The official was not authorized to talk publicly, and thus spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nGabuev said Putin will try to show there's a \"big club of countries\" that are \"ambivalent\" toward the war in Ukraine.\n\n-- -\n\nBurrows reported from London.

The CBI announced in March that it had conducted raids in a number of locations across India and initiated legal proceedings against several visa consultancy firms and agents implicated in the scheme.\n\nThe Indian Foreign Ministry said it had also raised the matter with Moscow, and sought the \"early release and return\" of all Indian nationals who are believed to be fighting for Russia. Moscow, meanwhile, stated that its missions in India and Sri Lanka, which also raised similar concerns over its citizens participating in the conflict, were in constant contact with officials in New Delhi and Colombo over the matter.",

        "title": "Is America Falling Behind China in the LLM Race? Yes... and No",
        "body": "The large language model (LLMs) race is heating up, and there's good reason to suggest that the gap between the U.S. and other countries like China is closing.\n\nEarlier this week, HuggingFace, a leading platform for AI research and benchmarking, released the Open LM Leaderboard v2 with new benchmarks, saying it was time to revisit how learning models were rated, with the gap closing between top LLMs.\n\nThe new leaderboard features Qwen-2-72B Instruct in the number one spot, a model developed in China by Alibaba Cloud. Another Chinese model featured in fourth place; Yi 1.5.\n\nThis highlights that China is gaining a deeper foothold in the world of open-source AI development and closing in on key performance benchmarks across the board.\n\nThe Chinese AI ecosystem had another significant win just recently with the release of Kling AI, a text-to-video model produced by Kuaishou Technology.\n\nKling AI not only produces videos that match Sora's text-to-video content but also boasts the ability to create videos of up to two minutes in length (compared to Sora's one-minute length).\n\nWe've also seen how Baidu's Ernie bot, a Chinese alternative to ChatGPT has gone on to have over 200 million users, with its application programming interfaces (APIs) used 200 million times per day.\n\nWhen we consider this alongside the success of Qwen-2-72B Instruct and Yi 1.5, the Chinese AI ecosystem is growing significantly.\n\nAt the same time, China is actively investing in innovation with a report produced by data analytics firm Govini finding that China has more patents than the U.S. in 13 of 15 critical technology areas.\n\nIn addition, China produces almost half of the world's leading AI researchers, with the number of AI researchers developed in China increasing from 29% to 47% between 2019 to 2022.\n\nChina is not only a force to be reckoned with in the market but also has the potential to seriously challenge U.S. AI development over the long term.\n\nAs of 2024, the U.S. is inarguably the most dominant country in the AI race. If we look at LLM providers, the U.S. is home to OpenAI and ChatGPT, Anthropic and Claude 3, Microsoft and Microsoft Copilot, Meta and Llama 3, X.Ai and Grok.\n\nAccording to CB Insights, total AI funding reached $42.5 billion in 2023, $31.0 billion of which went to the U.S., compared to $6.4 billion for Europe, and $9.4 billion to Asia. This demonstrates that the U.S. is the undisputed hub of VC investment in the sector.\n\nSo is the U.S. falling behind? The general consensus among researchers we communicated with was 'no'.\n\nNicholas Rious, CTO of Labviva, told Techopedia:\n\n\"America is currently ahead of the curve in the development of LLM models and is easily three years ahead of major technological competitors like China. It could lose this position by bogging innovators down with needless regulations.\"\n\nTom Burns, an AI researcher at Cornell University, shared similar thoughts with Techopedia.\n\n\"I do not think the U.S. is falling behind on LLM development, although the landscape is becoming more sophisticated and competitive.\n\n\"For instance, geopolitically-allied nations like Japan have seen the recent start-up Sakana AI emerge as a possible key player there, however they are strategically not focussing on training models from the ground up but rather merging and combining pre-trained models.\"\n\nThat being said, Burns did note that China is the main threat to current U.S. dominance simply because it has the resources to invest in the training of large foundation models. Europe is seeing lots of investment activity but faces more potential regulation under EU law.\n\nSo What's Next for the AI Market?\n\nBased on China's success in the realm of open-source LLMS, the development of solid proprietary products like Kling AI, and the large proportion of AI researchers from the region, it is likely that the gap between Chinese and American AI research will continue to close.\n\nWhile U.S. sanctions could restrict industry growth, Rious suggests that they could actually strengthen the Chinese technological ecosystem.\n\n\"Initial U.S. government restrictions on exports of open source LLM technologies and supportive hardware will slow China down a bit, but it will have the unintended consequence of driving China to develop other routes of importing technology and will make them faster over the long term as they build support technologies from the ground-up locally.\"\n\nDeborah Perry Piscione, co-founder and chief executive officer at Work3 Institute, also notes that China is making positive progress as competition ramps up.\n\n\"The rest of the world isn't sitting still. China, for instance, is pouring seemingly unlimited resources into AI.\n\n\"Companies such as Baidu are making significant advancements, narrowing the gap with the U.S. and data access is a key consideration in the future of LLM success, as some countries, like China, may have advantages in data collection and usage due to different privacy laws, potentially providing more comprehensive training datasets for their LLMs.\"\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAmerica may still be at the top of the AI development mountain, but the gap between it and other countries is thinning. Key competitors like China are well-positioned to eat away at that position and become a more potent force in the market.\n\nIt is also a reminder to Western markets that there is a wealth of AI tools out there that we are simply not exposed to.",

        "body": "Ever-closer collaboration between Russia, China and other countries has NATO and Western powers increasingly worried.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping will soon be meeting in person for the second time in two months as they visit Kazakhstan for a meeting of an international group founded to counter Western alliances.\n\nPutin and Xi last met in May when the Kremlin leader visited Beijing to underscore their close partnership that opposes the US-led democratic order and seeks to promote a more \"multipolar\" world.\n\nNow they'll be holding meetings as part of the annual session of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, which the two countries established in 2001 to discuss security concerns in Central Asia and the wider region.\n\nAmong its other members are Iran, India, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.\n\nThe meeting is another chance for Putin and Xi to demonstrate the strong personal ties in their \"strategic partnership\" as they both face soaring tensions with the West.\n\nPutin wants to show that Russia is not isolated over Western sanctions from the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. An arrest warrant has been issued for him by the International Criminal Court, which accuses him of personal responsibility for abductions of children from Ukraine. However, Kazakhstan is not party to the Rome Statute, and thus is not obliged to arrest him.\n\nPutin's meeting with Xi in May showed how China has offered diplomatic support to Moscow and is a top market for its oil and gas. Russia has relied on Beijing as a main source of high-tech imports to keep its military machine running.\n\nThe organisation helps China project its influence, especially across Central Asia and the Global South. Xi called for \"bridges of communication\" between countries last week and wants to further promote China as an alternative to the US and its allies.",
