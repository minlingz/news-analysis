        "body": "Manila, Jun 4 (AP) The Philippine military chief on Tuesday said the Chinese coast guard seized one of four food packs dropped by a plane for Filipino navy personnel at a territorial outpost that has been surrounded by Chinese vessels in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.\n\nGen Romeo Brawner said the Chinese personnel may have suspected the packages contained construction materials intended to reinforce a rusty Philippine navy ship ran aground at Second Thomas Shoal to serve as a Philippine outpost. After discovering the package contained food, they dumped the items, which included rice and biscuits, into the sea, Brawner said.\n\nAlso Read | Cybersecurity Attack: 81% Organisations Globally Paid Ransom To End Cyberattack and Recover Data for Third Year in Row, Says US-Based IT Firm Veeam.\n\nChinese officials did not immediately comment on Brawner's statement but they have repeatedly said the shoal, where the Philippine military deliberately grounded the navy ship in 1999, belonged to China and have demanded the ship be towed away. Operations to resupply Filipino forces at the grounded ship have led to skirmishes and collisions with Chinese coast guard ships that had damaged Philippine supply boats and injured several Filipino navy personnel.\n\nThe May 19 airdrops at Second Thomas Shoal by the Philippine military sparked a race by the Chinese coast guard and Philippine navy personnel aboard small motorboats to retrieve the four packages. The Filipinos managed to retrieve three of the floating packages and the Chinese grabbed one, Brawner told reporters in a news conference.\n\nAlso Read | China Train Accident: Six Railway Workers Dead After Being Hit by Freight Train in Heilongjiang Province.\n\nAfter the Chinese personnel dumped the food items, the Filipino sailors managed to retrieve some at sea but the rice had been soaked wet and could no longer be eaten, he said.\n\n\"This action of confiscating our supplies is illegal,\" Brawner said. \"They have no right to take our supplies, which are actually food items and some medicines.\"\n\nVideo and pictures issued by the Philippine military showed at least four motorboats maneuvering dangerously close to each other as the occupants struggled to retrieve items floating at sea, including what appeared to be a white plate and food containers. The men could be heard in the video yelling at each other.\n\nThe Philippines says the shoal, which lies less than 200 nautical miles (370 km) from its coast, falls within its internationally recognized exclusive economic zone and often cites a 2016 international arbitration ruling that invalidated China's expansive claims in the South China Sea based on historical grounds.\n\nThe territorial disputes have strained relations and sparked fears the conflict could bring China and the United States, a longtime treaty ally of the Philippines, into a military confrontation. Washington lays no territorial claims to the busy seaway, a key global trade route, but has warned that it's obligated to defend the Philippines if Filipino forces, ships and aircraft come under an armed attack in the South China Sea.\n\nAside from China and the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan are also involved in the long-seething territorial disputes, which are regarded as a flashpoint in Asia and a delicate fault line in the longstanding US-China rivalry in the region.

        "title": "Turkey's Top Diplomat Visits China, Planning Stops in Uyghur Genocide Region",
        "body": "Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan began a trip to China on Monday and is expected to travel to occupied East Turkistan on Tuesday, where the Communist Party has been engaging in a genocide of Uyghur and other indigenous Muslim communities since at least 2017.\n\nFidan is not expected to condemn the genocide - although it targets Turkic peoples - and his visit has prompted alarm among Uyghur civil society groups. Fidan made clear in remarks alongside Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Monday that his priorities upon visiting Beijing were galvanizing support for Hamas against Israel and increasing trade volume between China and Turkey.\n\nThe Islamist regime of strongman Recep Tayyip Erdogan was once one of the most vocal governments opposed to the abuse of Uyghurs by the Chinese government, which escalated into ethnic cleansing and, ultimately, genocide under ethnic Han dictator Xi Jinping. Erdogan significantly muted his criticisms after Turkey joined China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a predatory infrastructure scheme, in 2015. His foreign policy following the Hamas atrocities against Israel on October 7 has been almost singularly focused on supporting Hamas, which Erdogan himself has insisted is not a terrorist organization.\n\nIn his remarks alongside Wang Yi, Foreign Minister Fidan called China's support for Hamas \"extremely important\" and emphasized the growth in trade between the two countries.\n\n\"The great vision put forward by the two political leaders constitutes an important basis for the institutionalization and deepening of the relationship between China and Türkiye in modern times,\" the Turkish state-run Anadolu news agency quoted Fidan as saying in a report on Tuesday.\n\n\"Fidan also said the economy constitutes an important pillar of the relations between the two countries, that the bilateral trade volume reached $48 billion in 2023,\" Anadolu Agency continued, \"and that China is Türkiye's first largest trade partner in Asia and the third-largest trade partner globally.\"\n\nAnadolu did not offer any indication that Fidan addressed the ongoing Uyghur genocide or advocated for the rights of Turkic people under Chinese communist rule. Instead, Fidan celebrated the two East Turkistani cities that he is reportedly planning on visiting this week, Kashgar and the regional capital Urumqi, as critical to linking China and Turkey.\n\n\"These cities also play a bridge role between China and the Turkish world as well as between China and the Islamic world. They are symbols of our historical friendship and neighborhood,\" Fidan added.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party first occupied the East Turkistan Republic, then a sovereign state, in 1949. It has for decades acted to repress local cultures and impose totalitarian communism. Under Xi Jinping, however, the Communist Party began a campaign that extensive evidence suggests is a genocide. Communist officials began imprisoning Uyghurs and other Turkic peoples in concentration camps since at least 2017, where they are subject to extreme abuse, torture, forced sterilization, slavery, and other horrors. As many as three million people were shepherded into concentration camps in East Turkistan at their peak.\n\nAs a result of widespread international outrage, China claimed to shut down its \"Vocational and Educational Training Centers,\" the Party's term for the concentration camps. A widely condemned 2022 United Nations report took China's claims that the camps stopped existing in 2019 at face value.\n\nIn reality, not only has the genocide continued, but evidence suggests that China has funneled many of its victims into slavery, openly selling slaves to suppliers for international corporations online.\n\nErdogan was once a vocal supporter of the Uyghur cause, accusing China of \"genocide\" as early as 2009. Erdogan's stance after joining the BRI changed dramatically. In 2020, Turkey signed an extradition treaty with China, endangering the estimated 50,000 Uyghurs living in Turkey, and has muted criticism of the genocide. When Erdogan last mentioned Uyghur issues on the international stage - at the United Nations General Assembly in September - he said only that Turkey has \"sensitivity\" regarding the Uyghur community.\n\n\"We emphasize at every opportunity that we respect China's territorial integrity and sovereignty,\" Erdogan asserted. \"However, we will continue to express our sensitivity regarding the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of Uyghur Turks, with whom we have strong historical and humanitarian ties.\"\n\nFidan expressed hope on Monday that Turkey would expand its trade relations with China despite the human rights implications of doing so.\n\n\"We brought up the issue of how we can make trade figures more balanced in all our meetings. I made practical suggestions such as removing restrictions on the import of Turkish agricultural products,\" Fidan told reporters. \"Tourism is another area in which we want to further develop our cooperation.\"\n\nChinese officials welcomed Fidan's positive disposition and expressed hope to cooperate with Turkey on \"security,\" potentially resulting in Turkish law enforcement cooperating with the repressors of East Turkistan. Politburo member Chen Wenqing, who also met with Fidan, told him Beijing \"is willing to work with Turkey to bring cooperation in the field of security to new heights continuously,\" according to Chinese state propaganda outlet the Global Times.\n\nThe Global Times also suggested \"the visit will boost the China-Turkey cooperation under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative,\" in which China offers predatory loans to poor countries to commit them to pricey infrastructure projects they cannot afford.\n\nMembers of the international Uyghur community expressed concern and dismay with Turkey's stance on the genocide.\n\nSalih Hudayar, the foreign minister of the East Turkistan Government in Exile, said in a statement on Monday that Fidan's visit \"poses a grave threat to East Turkistan and the Uyghurs.\"\n\n\"Fidan has committed to deepening security cooperation with Chen, who last week visited East Turkistan and called for the continuation of the Uyghur Genocide under the guise of 'counter-terrorism,'\" he observed. \"The international community must remain vigilant and hold both nations accountable for their actions.\"\n\n\"Türkiye hosts one of the largest Uyghur diaspora communities globally, with approximately 50,000 individuals who fled the oppressive regime in China. However, this community faces growing harassment and intimidation by CCP-established transnational networks,\" the World Uyghur Congress, an international Uyghur association, said in a press statement on Fidan's visit. \"These networks spy on Uyghurs, exploiting factors such as passport applications, financial struggles, and concerns for family in East Turkistan to coerce Uyghur individuals into serving as informants, remaining silent on the Uyghur genocide, or participating in pro-China propaganda efforts.\"",

        "body": "Click here to get Khmer Times Breaking News direct into your Telegram\n\nSenate President Hun Sen has urged the United States (US) not to include Cambodia in its geopolitical rivalry in the region and sought to restore military cooperation.\n\nMr Hun Sen said that \"The US should not place Cambodia in its strategic rivalry, and should not use Cambodia as a place to compete geopolitically with other superpowers, which Cambodia has pursued diplomatic policies with, based on international law.\"\n\nHis remarks were made yesterday, during a courtesy call on him at the Senate by US Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin Ill who was on a one-day visit to Cambodia.\n\n\"The US has provided assistance to Cambodia in the areas of economy and defence in the past, and in order to improve our relationship, the two countries must address obstacles as soon as possible and continue to expand cooperation more effectively,\" Mr Hun Sen noted.\n\n\"We have been cooperating with each other in the past through dialogue between the two countries' Ministries of Defence, including on mutual agreement and joint military exercises and that is what we must continue to work together on,\" he said.\n\nAustin's official one day visit to Cambodia was aimed at strengthening US relationships with allies and partners in support of a shared regional vision for peace, stability and conflict deterrence.\n\nMr Hun Sen said that both sides should make efforts to improve good relations and although this has been murky in the past, he considered that the ties between Cambodia and the United States are not too bad.\n\nHe blamed past controversial issues on a lack of trust between the two sides and said that it was now time to find ways to rebuild trust together.\n\nMr Hun Sen noted that previous misunderstandings were due to a lack of information and in-depth dialogue between the two sides.\n\nHe advocated face-to-face dialogues because by distancing each other regarding issues would lead to the loss of credible information.\n\nMr Hun Sen said one important priority issue for which dialogue should be initiated was in the field of national defence to ensure that there is no mutual suspicion and to rebuild trust between the two countries.\n\nIn response, Austin thanked Mr Hun Sen for the warm welcome and extended his condolences over the passing away of the Great Supreme Patriarch Venerable Tep Vong whose body was cremated on Monday. He also expressed his condolences over the loss of 20 Cambodian military officers during an explosion at a depot in Kampong Speu province.\n\nHe gave the assurance that the United States will work with the Cambodian government to improve relations between the two countries.\n\nAustin said it was an opportunity for the two countries to make adjustments to improve attitudes and improve relations.\n\n\"Even though we still have some problems, we can sit down and work together to improve relations for our countries,\" he said.\n\nThe two sides agreed to continue dialogues to find a new path in Cambodian-US relations for the future.\n\nAustin also expressed praise for Prime Minister Hun Manet's strong commitment to improve relations between the two countries in the field of defence.\n\nHe said the US will reopen admission for Cambodian students to study at the West Point Military Academy in the United States (from which Mr Hun Manet himself had previously graduated).\n\nAdmission to the academy had been closed to Cambodian students over political differences in 2017.\n\nAustin added there would be more exchanges of dialogue in the military, joint exercises on humanitarian relief work and disaster management, continued demining training and clearance of unexploded ordnance.\n\nHe emphasised the need to restart defence dialogue to resolve differences and build greater trust for the two countries' mutually beneficial future.\n\nThe two sides also exchanged views on the Russia-Ukraine war, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and the South China Sea dispute.\n\nRegarding issues in the South China Sea, Mr Hun Sen said that in order to have peace and stability in the region, all parties concerned must strictly adhere to the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC) agreement, the parties to the dispute must resolve it together.\n\nHe noted that Cambodia as ASEAN Chair in 2022, had pushed for the South China Sea Code of Conduct (COC) to be put into practice to ensure long-term security in the region.\n\nOn the issue of the war between Ukraine and Russia and the conflict in the Middle East, the two sides agreed that war could not end with the continued use of weapons and that a negotiated solution was needed.\n\nIn particular, both sides agreed that a two-state solution in the Middle East conflict would provide lasting peace for Israel and Palestine.\n\nAustin also paid a courtesy call on Mr Hun Manet at the Peace Palace yesterday.\n\nGovernment Spokesman Pen Bona said that during the discussions, Austin had said the United States will be ready to work closely with Cambodia to establish mechanisms to build better relations and cooperation.\n\nHe said Austin expressed his pleasure to work closely with the Kingdom, which will organise the upcoming US-ASEAN Defence Dialogue in 2024.\n\nAustin also praised the Cambodian Army's demining skills and was confident that the United States and Cambodia would continue to cooperate in the field of demining, Bona said.\n\nMr Hun Manet expressed his belief that the visit by the US Secretary of Defense will provide new opportunities to expand defence cooperation between the two countries, including the fight against terrorism, human trafficking and drug trafficking, he added.\n\n\"The two sides discussed and exchanged views on regional and international security and the need to participate in building peace, stability, unity and prosperity in the region and internationally which would mutually benefit both countries,\" Bona said.\n\n\"Samdech Hun Manet requested the United States to resume cooperation in areas such as the exchange of military students between the two countries and operations on military exercises between Cambodian and US troops,\" he added.\n\nPentagon Press Secretary Major General Pat Ryder said that apart from calling upon Mr Hun Sen and Mr Hun Manet, Austin had met separately with Minister of National Defence General Tea Seiha.\n\nHe also engaged with Cambodian alumni of US Professional Military Education (PME) programmes, as well as cadets from US military academies, including the US Air Force Academy who are visiting Cambodia for educational purposes.\n\n\"In their meetings, the (Cambodian and US sides) discussed opportunities to strengthen the US Cambodia bilateral defence relationship in support of regional peace and security, including through the resumption of military training exchanges on disaster assistance and United Nations Peacekeeping, training and exchanges on demining and unexploded ordnance clearance, and Cambodia's access to US-PME programmes,\" he said.\n\nThey also welcomed continued discussions about these issues between their respective defence establishments, he said.\n\nAustin's second trip to Cambodia as Secretary of Defense follows his November 2022 trip for the 9th ASEAN Defense Ministers' Meeting (ADMM)-Plus in Siem Reap province, Maj Gen Ryder noted.\n\nKin Phea, director-general of the International Relations Institute at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, said yesterday that Austin's visit could have a positive impact on bilateral relations between Cambodia and the United States. It is also a new opportunity for both sides to talk openly about their problems or concerns as well as strategic interests.\n\nHe believes that Cambodia has always wanted to establish relations and cooperation with all countries in the world.\n\n\"If the two countries want to strategically deepen relations, the two sides should exchange visits frequently, as historical relations between the two countries have rarely involved high-level exchanges,\" Phea added.",

        "title": "Philippines denies its troops pointed guns at Chinese coast guard personnel",
        "body": "The Philippines on Tuesday rejected Beijing's allegations that Filipino troops had pointed guns at Chinese coast guard personnel after they \"dangerously approached\" a military outpost in the disputed South China Sea.\n\nChina's state-run media on Sunday said that Filipino marines stationed on the BRP Sierra Madre, a World War II-era naval ship run aground on Second Thomas (Ayungin) Shoal, had aimed their weapons at rigid-hulled inflatable boats (RHIBs) deployed by a China Coast Guard ship on May 19.\n\nPhilippine military chief Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr. disputed the account, saying the troops were armed but followed strict rules of engagement and had acted \"with the highest level of professionalism, restraint and discipline.\"\n\n\"We are denying that any of our soldiers pointed their guns deliberately ...\" Brawner said at a press briefing Tuesday. \"But we will not deny the fact that they were armed because the BRP Sierra Madre is a commissioned navy ship and therefore it is authorized to have weapons.\n\nBrawner was echoing comments he had made in an interview with GMA news program \"24 Oras\" a day earlier.\n\n\"We have that right because of the concept of self-defense. We have the right to defend ourselves from any armed attack or external attack,\" he said.\n\nManila deliberately ran the rusty ship aground in 1999 to serve as its military outpost at the shoal. Since then, it has had to dispatch ships and boats regularly to deliver fresh supplies to the military personnel onboard the BRP Sierra Madre.\n\nBrawner accused the China Coast Guard of deploying RHIBs to intercept supplies that were being air-dropped to the Philippine troops.\n\nThe Chinese RHIBs, Brawner said, came \"very, very close\" to the BRP Sierra Madre and from the point of view of troops on board \"posed a danger or a threat.\"\n\nThe Chinese coast guard seized one of the four bags - which were dropped and contained food and some medicine - and later scattered the supplies at sea, Brawner said.\n\n\"Such behavior is unacceptable and undermines efforts to maintain peace and stability in the region,\" Brawner said.\n\nThe incident adds to rising tensions in the South China Sea. China claims almost all of the mineral-rich waterway while dismissing competing claims from the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam and Taiwan.\n\nIn 2016, an international arbitration court ruled in favor of the Philippines, throwing out China's sweeping historical claims. Beijing has never accepted the decision.\n\nChina has occupied Scarborough Shoal, which lies within Manila's 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zone, for more than a decade.\n\nLast week, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., during a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue defense forum in Singapore, hit out at China's \"assertive actions that aim to propagate excessive, baseless claims through force, intimidation and deception.\"\n\nThe China Embassy in Manila did not reply to requests for comment on Brawner's statement, but sought to debunk Marcos' speech in Singapore.\n\n\"China's territorial sovereignty over maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea are based on solid historical and legal grounds,\" the Chinese Embassy said on Monday, quoting a foreign ministry spokesperson.",

JV Ejercito condemned the CCG and said China's \"lack of compassion\" was shown when they interfered with the evacuation of sick Filipino soldiers. \"These heartless actions put lives at risk and show a complete lack of care for people's well-being,\" he said. He said China \"must respect Philippine's maritime activities in the area and refrain from engaging in actions that escalate tensions and jeopardize peace and stability in the region.\"\n\nSenate President Francis Escudero, meanwhile, reaffirmed his strong belief in the power of peaceful resolution through dialogue. He emphasized that this approach is a viable solution and the key to resolving the territorial disputes in the WPS.\n\n\"Ultimately, the important thing is that we stand united in not giving up sovereignty over those islands and oceans. But I still firmly believe that the (conflict can be resolved) through dialogue and should not lead to a war between our country and China and other countries,\" the Senate chief said in Filipino as he congratulated President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on his speech in Singapore asserting the country's sovereignty in the WPS.",

By adhering to international law, we can ensure the West Philippine Sea remains a sea of peace, stability, and prosperity.\n\nThe President added the Philippines will not yield in the face of ongoing issues in the maritime region, underlining \"As President, I have sworn to this solemn commitment from the very first day that I took office. I do not intend to yield. Filipinos do not yield.\"\n\nHe said the Philippines will remain compliant to the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the 2016 Arbitral Award that provided the country a strong foundation for the peaceful resolution and management of disputes in Philippine waters.\n\nManila's policy in the South China Sea is built upon these two touchstones, by which the Philippines will continue to work with ASEAN and China towards an effective and substantive code of conduct, one firmly anchored on UNCLOS.",

        "body": "MANILA >> Philippine troops stationed on a warship grounded on a disputed South China Sea shoal held on to their weapons after Chinese coast guard boats came very close to the ship but they did not point their guns at them, military officials said on Tuesday.\n\nArmed Forces of the Philippines Chief of Staff Romeo Brawner disputed an account by China's state CCTV of what transpired during a routine resupply mission for Filipino troops on May 19.\n\nCCTV had reported at least two Filipino personnel pointed guns in their coast guards' direction during the confrontation at the BRP Sierra Madre, the vessel Manila grounded on Second Thomas Shoal and turned into a garrison in 1999.\n\n\"It was just in preparation for self-defense in case something happens because they were very close,\" Brawner told a press conference, describing the actions of the China Coast Guard as \"provocative.\"\n\nMilitary officials said Chinese rigid hull inflatable boats came within five to 10 meters of the beached Sierra Madre, and seized some of the supplies that were air dropped for troops, actions they said were illegal and unacceptable.\n\n\"This was a cause of alarm. So our soldiers as a precautionary measure, held on to their firearms. It is part of the rules of engagement,\" Brawner said.\n\n\"We are denying that any of our soldiers pointed deliberately their guns at any of the Chinese ... But we will not deny the fact that they were armed.\"\n\nBrawner said the Sierra Madre, a Second World War-era warship purposely grounded on the reef, is a commissioned vessel of the Philippine navy so it is authorised to have weapons.\n\n\"We have the right to defend ourselves,\" Brawner said, adding the Philippines would continue to assert its sovereignty in the area.\n\nChina claims almost the entire South China Sea, which includes the Second Thomas Shoal. It has deployed hundreds of vessels to patrol the waterway, including what Manila refers to as \"Chinese maritime militia,\" which it said were also present on May 19.\n\nChina's foreign ministry said the Philippines' actions at the shoal, which it calls Renai Reef, were illegal.\n\n\"On this issue the Philippines is the one who makes frequent infringements and provocations,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a briefing on Tuesday.\n\n\"The Philippines sending vessels to Ren'ai is in itself illegal, the Philippines is escalating the situation and we cannot accept it.\"",

Armed Forces Chief of Staff Romeo Brawner clarified that while troops held their weapons for self-defense due to the close proximity of Chinese boats, they did not aim them at the Chinese. The Chinese coast guard reportedly came within five to ten meters of the grounded Philippine warship BRP Sierra Madre and seized some supplies, actions deemed illegal by the Philippines. Brawner emphasized the Philippines' right to self-defense and its intention to assert sovereignty in the area. China, which claims almost the entire South China Sea, including the shoal, accused the Philippines of illegal actions and provocations."

The incident is part of ongoing tensions, with China claiming the shoal and demanding the removal of a grounded Philippine navy ship used as an outpost since 1999. The Philippines asserts the shoal is within its exclusive economic zone, supported by a 2016 international arbitration ruling against China's claims.

Romeo Brawner said the Chinese personnel may have suspected the packages contained construction materials intended to reinforce a rusty Philippine navy ship ran aground at Second Thomas Shoal to serve as a Philippine outpost. After discovering the package contained food, they dumped the items, which included rice and biscuits, into the sea, Brawner said.\n\nChinese officials did not immediately comment on Brawner's statement but they have repeatedly said the shoal, where the Philippine military deliberately grounded the navy ship in 1999, belonged to China and have demanded the ship be towed away. Operations to resupply Filipino forces at the grounded ship have led to skirmishes and collisions with Chinese coast guard ships that had damaged Philippine supply boats and injured several Filipino navy personnel.\n\nThe May 19 airdrops at Second Thomas Shoal by the Philippine military sparked a race by the Chinese coast guard and Philippine navy personnel aboard small motorboats to retrieve the four packages. The Filipinos managed to retrieve three of the floating packages and the Chinese grabbed one, Brawner told reporters in a news conference.\n\nAfter the Chinese personnel dumped the food items, the Filipino sailors managed to retrieve some at sea but the rice had been soaked wet and could no longer be eaten, he said.\n\n\"This action of confiscating our supplies is illegal,\" Brawner said. \"They have no right to take our supplies, which are actually food items and some medicines.\"\n\nVideo and pictures issued by the Philippine military showed at least four motorboats maneuvering dangerously close to each other as the occupants struggled to retrieve items floating at sea, including what appeared to be a white plate and food containers.

        "body": "Cambodia and the US will restore relations, restart military exercise, and accept Cambodian military students to study at West Point, according to a Facebook post by senate president Hun Sen who met US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Tuesday morning.\n\nOn his Facebook page, Hun Sen said Austin confirmed this during his visit, bringing the message from the US that they \"will work together with Samdech Techo [Hun Sen] and the Royal Government of Cambodia to restore and improve relations between the two countries\".\n\n\"The two countries can change [our] attitude to improve our relations, although we have different views on some issues. But our cooperation in many sectors [has been] fruitful and we can sit down to work together for fruitful results,\" Hun Sen said, quoting Austin.\n\nAustin has agreed to continue dialogues, notably on defense policy, to find a new path for the Cambodia-US relations in future.\n\nHe also mentioned that the US will reopen enrollment for Cambodians to study at the West Point military academy, participate in exchange programs in the joint military exercise as preparations for disaster relief, and continue training in demining landmines, Hun Sen said.\n\nIn 2021, the US canceled the scholarship for Cambodians to enroll in the West Point military on the basis that Cambodia had \"lost its eligibility for the military academy program due to weak cooperation in several areas of traditional bilateral military engagement\".\n\nHun Sen responded by agreeing with the US Defense Secretary's intention to enhance good relations.\n\n\"[I] consider the special relationship between our countries as not too bad [now] compared to the past. Previously, both sides lacked mutual trust, so we needed to find ways to build more trust. We have to manage different views, narrow differences, even if it is difficult,\" Hun Sen wrote.\n\n\"Another issue was the lack of information, and misjudgment, which confused both parties [as there was] no exchange of information and discussion,\" he continued.\n\nHun Sen called on the US government and other powerful nations not to pull Cambodia into its geopolitical conflict or \"use it as a battlefield\".\n\nHe reiterated that Cambodia has implemented an independent policy based on the law which does not take sides, and considers all countries as friends.\n\nFollowing his meeting with Hun Sen, Austin met Prime Minister Hun Manet where they discussed strengthening relations and cooperation with Cambodia in various sectors, particularly in the defense sector.\n\n\"The US is ready to work closely with Cambodia to implement a mechanism to build better relations and cooperation,\" Hun Manet wrote on Facebook page.\n\n\"The National Defense Minister and I also discussed mechanisms for re-cooperation [with the US] on some sectors as well as exchange of military students between our countries and joint military exercises with the US,\" Hun Manet said.\n\nIn an email response to CamboJA News, US embassy public diplomacy officer Wesley Holzer said this was the first bilateral visit by a US Secretary of Defense. However, it is a second visit to Cambodia for Austin who attended the ASEAN Defense Ministers Meeting-Plus in Siem Reap in November 2022.\n\nAccording to a statement read out by Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder, Austin discussed opportunities to strengthen bilateral defense relationships in support of regional peace and security with Cambodia. This would be via \"the resumption of military training exchanges on disaster assistance and United Nations Peacekeeping, training and exchanges on demining and unexploded ordnance clearance, and Cambodia's access to US professional military education programs\".\n\nAustin, who arrived in Cambodia after attending the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, is expected to meet with his counterparts in the Indo-Pacific region as well as Admiral Dong Jun, his Chinese counterpart.\n\nHe will conclude his trip in France, where he will mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day, according to the U.S Defense Department.\n\nAustin later tweeted on X that he met with Hun Manet, a fellow West Point graduate. \"We discussed how the US and Cambodia can strengthen our defense relationship in support of regional peace and stability,\" he wrote.\n\nSeparately, an interview by Cambodia-China Radio with National Defense Minister Tea Seiha was posted by the Chinese embassy in Cambodia on May 28. In the interview, he thanked the Chinese government for the opportunity where both armies exchanged skills and acquired new skills and modernized weaponry in the recently concluded annual Golden Dragon military exercise.\n\n\"The [military] exercise was a demonstration of the relationship, especially showcasing the skills and experience of the Chinese People's Liberation Army which was transferred to the Cambodian army to understand better and increase its operation levels,\" Seiha said.\n\nHe added that Cambodia \"warmly welcomed Chinese ships docked at Preah Sihanouk Autonomous Port\" for the Golden Dragon military drill.\n\nIn the four-minute video clip, he also raised the South China Sea dispute, where he claimed that China was also \"trying to protect what belongs to China\". \"There is nothing we can't resolve if those countries try to meet and lay the problems on the table to discuss and find a solution,\" Seiha said.\n\nIn recent years, Cambodia-US relations have somewhat weakened after Cambodia suspended a joint military drill with the US in 2017. This was further compounded by concerns arising from 2019 that the Ream naval base would grant China's military exclusive access to a part of the base, situated on the Gulf of Thailand.\n\nHowever, both Cambodia and China have repeatedly denied the US' claims.\n\nThe Ream naval base previously featured US-funded installations, which were demolished in 2020. In 2022, the US Department of State urged Cambodia to be \"fully transparent\" about \"present and future Chinese activities at the Ream naval base\".\n\nMeanwhile, political analyst Meas Nee said the US was concerned about China's influence in relation to the Ream naval base and the presence of the Chinese army.\n\n\"All these can affect the economy and diplomacy if the situation remains unclear on both sides. We say it's not [Chinese army] but we have conducted military exercises with China, and we refused to do it with the US,\" Nee said.\n\nBut, he said, the US is keen on keeping diplomatic relations with Cambodia for the sake of strengthening regional security and stability.\n\nGovernment spokesperson Pen Bona declined to comment further, urging the reporter to refer to the government statement via social media.\n\nNational Defense Ministry spokesperson Chhum Socheat did not respond to questions.",

It has deployed hundreds of vessels to patrol the waterway, including what Manila refers to as \"Chinese maritime militia,\" which it said were also present on May 19.\n\nChina's foreign ministry said the Philippines' actions at the shoal, which it calls Renai Reef, were illegal.\n\n\"On this issue the Philippines is the one who makes frequent infringements and provocations,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a briefing on Tuesday.\n\n\"The Philippines sending vessels to Ren'ai is in itself illegal, the Philippines is escalating the situation and we cannot accept it.\"",

        "body": "Senate President Pro Tempore Jinggoy Ejercito Estrada said President Marcos was calm and not combative when he was at the 21st International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore.\n\nEstrada said this during the Kapihan sa Senado on Tuesday, June 4, after he was asked if China will be more intense and hostile in its activities in the West Philippine Sea (WPS) following the Shangri-La Dialogue.\n\n\"That has to be seen,\" he said.\n\nEstrada said he was present when Marcos made history as the first Philippine leader to deliver a keynote address to open the 21st edition of the IISS.\n\n\"I was listening to his almost an hour speech and he covered everything. Even the three questions propounded to him, he answered it very well, he was not combative,\" Estrada said.\n\n\"Kasi may isang Chinese official na nagtanong, siyempre medyo palaban yung tanong (There was this Chinese official who asked, and the question was very critical) and the President answered it calmly, hindi siya combative,\" he added.\n\nLatest WPS issue\n\nRegarding the maritime disputes in the West Philippine Sea, he said that China's bullying is growing more severe and but filing a diplomatic protest is the Philippines' only remaining option instead of plunging into a war with China.\n\nGeneral Romeo Brawner Jr., Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) recently disclosed that China Cost Guard (CCG) personnel came as close as five to 10 meters from BRP Sierra Madre, a grounded Philippine Navy (PN) vessel which serves as an AFP outpost in the contested Ayungin Shoal, to seize one of the four food packages meant for the troops during a resupply mission.\n\nThe resupply mission was held on May 19 via airdrop method. After finding out that the packages contained food, the CCG threw it back into the water.\n\nPrior to the confrontation, Brawner said the CCG also blocked a medical evacuation (medevac) of a Fiipino trooper who fell ill while onboard BRP Sierra Madre.\n\n\"For me that is totally unacceptable,\" Estrada said.\n\nIn a statement, he called it a \"callous act\" that must be met with the utmost condemnation by the government and the international community.\n\n\"As I call upon our government to continue asserting our sovereignty and safeguard the welfare of our soldiers stationed at the Ayungin Shoal, I urge our international allies to stand with the Philippines in condemning in the strongest terms the recent actions of the China Coast Guard in the West Philippine Sea,\" he said.\n\nEstrada mentioned that the Philippines has consistently sought peaceful and diplomatic means to address the territorial disputes and uphold the rule of law. The reported seizure and dumping overboard of food and other supplies meant for our troops as well as the purported obstruction of a medical evacuation operation for ailing Filipino soldiers are \"callous acts\" that should not be tolerated.\n\n\"We should pursue all necessary measures to demand accountability for the latest acts by the CCG. Our soldiers deserve our unwavering support. Their bravery, dedication, and sacrifices should not be in vain and we must ensure that justice prevails,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Francis Tolentino echoed Estrada's statement, saying that a diplomatic protest must be filed.\n\nHe also said that China is doing these actions out of desperation following the success of President Marcos' participation in the Shangri-La Dialogue.\n\n\"Nakikita yung desperateness nila (China) ngayon dahil maliwanag na talagang viniviolate nila ang lahat ng umiiral batas pandaigdigan (We can see how desperate China is right now because they are clearly violating all international laws in place),\" he said.\n\nEven the President himself believes that China is \"punishing\" the Philippines through their recent aggressive actions in the WPS due to his speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore.\n\nTolentino believes that what China did is indeed a form of provocation.",

He called for continued diplomatic protests and international condemnation of China's actions.\n\nGeneral Romeo Brawner Jr. of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) detailed the CCG's interference with a resupply mission and a medical evacuation, labeling these acts as unacceptable. Senate Majority Leader Francis Tolentino supported filing a diplomatic protest, suggesting China's actions are a desperate response to President Marcos' successful participation in the dialogue. Both Estrada and Tolentino emphasized the need for international support and accountability for China's provocations."

        "body": "Philippine troops on a grounded warship at Second Thomas Shoal held their weapons during a tense encounter with Chinese coast guard boats. The clash occurred amidst resupply operations, leading to accusations and denials from both sides regarding provocative actions. The incident underscores ongoing territorial disputes in the South China Sea.\n\nPhilippine troops stationed on a warship grounded on a disputed South China Sea shoal held on to their weapons after Chinese coast guard boats came very close to the ship but they did not point their guns at them, military officials said on Tuesday. Armed Forces of the Philippines Chief of Staff Romeo Brawner disputed an account by China's state CCTV of what transpired during a routine resupply mission for Filipino troops on May 19.\n\nCCTV had reported at least two Filipino personnel pointed guns in their coast guards' direction during the confrontation at the BRP Sierra Madre, the vessel Manila grounded on Second Thomas Shoal and turned into a garrison in 1999. \"It was just in preparation for self-defence in case something happens because they were very close,\" Brawner told a press conference, describing the actions of the China Coast Guard as \"provocative.\"\n\nMilitary officials said Chinese rigid hull inflatable boats came within five to 10 meters of the beached Sierra Madre, and seized some of the supplies that were air dropped for troops, actions they said were illegal and unacceptable. \"This was a cause of alarm. So our soldiers as a precautionary measure, held on to their firearms. It is part of the rules of engagement,\" Brawner said.\n\n\"We are denying that any of our soldiers pointed deliberately their guns at any of the Chinese ... But we will not deny the fact that they were armed.\" Brawner said the Sierra Madre, a Second World War-era warship purposely grounded on the reef, is a commissioned vessel of the Philippine navy so it is authorised to have weapons.\n\n\"We have the right to defend ourselves,\" Brawner said, adding the Philippines would continue to assert its sovereignty in the area. China claims almost the entire South China Sea, which includes Second Thomas Shoal. It has deployed hundreds of vessels to patrol the waterway, including what Manila refers to as \"Chinese maritime militia,\" which it said were also present on May 19.\n\nChina's foreign ministry said the Philippines' actions at the shoal, which it calls Renai Reef, were illegal. \"On this issue the Philippines is the one who makes frequent infringements and provocations,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a briefing on Tuesday.\n\n\"The Philippines sending vessels to Ren'ai is in itself illegal, the Philippines is escalating the situation and we cannot accept it.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

Romeo Brawner Jr. disputed the account, saying the troops were armed but followed strict rules of engagement and always acted \"with the highest level of professionalism, restraint and discipline.\"\n\n\"We are denying that any of our soldiers pointed their guns deliberately ...\" Brawner said at a press briefing Tuesday. \"But we will not deny the fact that they were armed because the BRP Sierra Madre is a commissioned navy ship and therefore it is authorized to have weapons.\n\n\"We have that right because of the concept of self-defense. We have the right to defend ourselves from any armed attack or external attack,\" he said.\n\nManila deliberately ran the rusty, old BRP Sierra Madre aground in 1999 to serve as its outpost at the shoal and has to dispatch ships on a regular basis to deliver fresh supplies to military personnel there.\n\nBrawner accused the China Coast Guard of deploying rigid hulled inflatable boats (RHIBs) to intercept supplies that were being air-dropped to the troops.\n\nThe Chinese RHIBs, Brawner said, came \"very, very close\" to the BRP Sierra Madre and from the point of view of soldiers on board \"posed a danger or a threat.\"\n\nThe Chinese coast guard seized one of the four bags that were dropped, which contained food and some medicine, and later scattered the supplies at sea, he said.\n\n\"Such behavior is unacceptable and undermines efforts to maintain peace and stability in the region,\" Brawner said.\n\nThe incident adds to rising tensions in the South China Sea. China claims almost all of the mineral-rich waterway while dismissing competing claims from the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam and Taiwan.\n\nIn 2016, an international arbitration court ruled in favor of the Philippines, throwing out China's sweeping historical claims. Beijing has never accepted the decision.\n\nChina has occupied Scarborough Shoal, which lies within Manila's 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zone, for more than a decade.\n\nLast week, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue defense forum hit out at China's \"assertive actions that aim to propagate excessive, baseless claims through force, intimidation and deception.\"\n\nThe China Embassy in Manila did not reply to requests for comment on Brawner's statement, but sought to debunk Marcos' speech in Singapore.\n\n\"China's territorial sovereignty over maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea are based on solid historical and legal grounds,\" the Chinese Embassy said on Monday, quoting a foreign ministry spokesperson.",

        "summary": "The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) released a video showing Chinese agents seizing supplies airdropped for Filipino troops on the BRP Sierra Madre at Ayungin Shoal. The Chinese agents, using \"dangerous\" maneuvers, came very close to Filipino soldiers, posing a threat, according to AFP chief General Romeo Brawner Jr. The Philippine Navy also presented a video to refute Chinese state media claims that Filipino troops pointed guns at the Chinese agents on May 19. The video showed Chinese agents, possibly from the China Coast Guard or People's Liberation Army, intercepting one of the supply packages. This incident highlights ongoing tensions, as China claims almost the entire South China Sea, including areas within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone, despite a 2016 international tribunal ruling against China's claims."

This was repeated also yesterday. We were able to monitor and challenge all their actions in Sabina Shoal,\" Philippine Navy spokesperson Commodore Roy Vincent Trinidad said in a press briefing.\n\nAccording to Trinidad, the Chinese military launched a hovercraft and aircraft and performed maneuvers at sea.\n\n\"First and foremost, they have no right to be within our exclusive economic zone. The conduct of an exercise is unauthorized under UNCLOS. It is not allowed,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of Chinese vessels in WPS features increased to 125 from 112 last week, according to Trinidad.\n\nThe Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) recently deployed a ship to Sabina Shoal as it accused China of building an artificial island in the area.\n\nSabina Shoal serves as the rendezvous point for vessels carrying out resupply missions to Filipino troops stationed on BRP Sierra Madre grounded at Ayungin Shoal.\n\nChina claims almost the entire South China Sea, a conduit for more than $3 trillion in annual ship commerce. Its territorial claims overlap with those of the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Brunei.\n\nManila calls parts of the waters within its exclusive economic zone as the West Philippine Sea.\n\nIn 2016, an international arbitration tribunal in the Hague ruled that China's claims over the South China Sea had no legal basis, a decision Beijing does not recognize. -- VAL, GMA Integrated News",

The Chinese coast guard's actions were described as \"provocative,\" with their boats coming within 5-10 meters of the BRP Sierra Madre and seizing some supplies. Brawner emphasized that the troops' actions were for self-defense and part of the rules of engagement. He asserted the Philippines' right to defend its sovereignty in the area. There was no immediate response from the Chinese embassy in Manila."

        "title": "Ukrainian president berates China at Singapore security conference",
        "body": "facebook icon\n\nThe unannounced appearance of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the annual Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore last weekend is another sign of the global character of the US-NATO war against Russia in Ukraine.\n\nZelensky exploited the opportunity to lash out at China for failing to line up against Russia as he sought support at Asia's premier security forum for Ukraine's so-called peace conference to be held in Switzerland later this month.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference, the Ukrainian president accused Russia of using Chinese diplomats to pressure governments not to attend the Swiss gathering. Zelensky, who heads the US-backed puppet regime in Kyiv, declared: \"It is unfortunate that such a big independent powerful country as China is an instrument in the hands of Putin.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian-sponsored \"peace conference\" is nothing more than a propaganda exercise for the Zelensky regime and its imperialist backers. The Ukrainian president explained that the forum will revolve around a discussion of points of his \"peace plan\" which amount to a demand for Russia's capitulation.\n\nThe meeting in Switzerland will take place as the US has dramatically escalated the conflict by giving the green light to Ukraine to use American long-range missiles to strike into Russian territory greatly heightening the danger of nuclear war. That is the real character of the \"peace\" that will be discussed.\n\nChina stated last week that it would not send a delegation to the summit, insisting that a genuine peace conference should have \"recognition by both Russia and Ukraine, equal participation by all parties, and fair discussion of all peace plans.\"\n\nZelensky also parroted Washington's claims that China is selling \"dual use\" items to Russia enabling it to maintain its military capabilities. Certain elements that make up parts of Russia's weaponry, he said, \"come from China.\"\n\nUS Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin mouthed the same accusation in a meeting with his Chinese counterpart Dong Jun, warning that there would be \"consequences\" for any Chinese support for Russia's military. Washington is planning another round of punitive sanctions on China over the export of \"dual use\" items to Russia.\n\nWhat staggering hypocrisy! As the Biden administration supplies tens of billions worth of actual weaponry to Ukraine to attack Russian forces, it demands that China halt trade in so-called \"dual use\" items -- an ill-defined category covering a vast array of goods.\n\nIn fact, US imperialism is seeking to bully China into assisting in the economic crippling of Russia. Washington had calculated that its far-reaching sanctions on Russia -- including a freeze on its foreign currency reserves of $350 billion and exclusion from the SWIFT system for facilitating international transactions -- would bring Moscow to its knees.\n\nUS objections are not just to \"dual use\" items but that the growth of overall Chinese trade has provided an economic lifeline to Russia. Estimates cited in the US-based Foreign Affairs journal indicate bilateral trade grew by 36 percent to $190 billion in 2022 and further expanded to $240 billion last year. The bulk of China's imports from Russia were oil, gas and coal, while Chinese exports were dominated by industrial equipment, cars and consumer electronics.\n\nChinese Defence Minister Dong denied US allegations that Beijing was bolstering Russia's defence industries with dual-use exports. He pointed out that China had not provided weapons to either side of the conflict and had put stricter controls on the export of dual-use items.\n\nSpeaking on Monday, China's foreign ministry spokesperson defended China's trade with Russia. \"We also attach great importance to our relations with Ukraine... China and Ukraine have maintained communication and cooperation since the Ukrainian crisis escalated,\" Mao Ning said.\n\nEven as it is waging war against Russia in Ukraine and backing Israel's genocide in Gaza, US imperialism is accelerating its military build-up throughout the Indo-Pacific against China, which Washington regards as the chief threat to its global dominance.\n\nUS Defense Secretary Austin boasted to the gathering about the \"new era of security\" in the Indo-Pacific as the US strengthens military alliances and partnerships in the region such as AUKUS -- with Australia and the UK -- and the \"Quad\" -- with Japan, India and Australia. This \"new convergence\" outlined by Austin is accompanied by an expansion of joint war games aimed at rehearsing for conflict with China.\n\nThat the US build-up of \"collective capacity\" is aimed against China was evident in the comments by two close US allies to the Singapore summit -- Australia and the Philippines. Both lashed out against China's activities in the South China and East China Seas.\n\nIn a deliberately provocative speech, Australian Defence Minister Richard Marles blamed China not only for recent confrontations with Australian naval forces, but also condemned its purported aggressive actions towards the Philippines and Taiwan.\n\n\"Actions by Chinese vessels in the West Philippine Sea [the Philippine term for the East China Sea], such as the use of water cannons and the ramming of Philippine vessels, are a serious escalation of tensions,\" he declared, adding that \"China's behaviour towards Taiwan creates similar concerns.\"\n\nThe US and its allies, particularly the Philippines, have deliberately heightened tensions with China over longstanding territorial disputes in the South China Sea. In the case of Taiwan, the Biden administration has effectively overturned the \"One China\" policy by boosting relations and arms sales to Taipei. It also has put US military \"trainers\" on the island.\n\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr also indirectly condemned China's actions declaring that he would not allow the country to yield one square inch or even a millimetre of its territory and maritime zones. While claiming to want to resolve issues through \"dialogue and diplomacy,\" the Marcos administration has greatly enhanced the US military presence in the country and involvement in joint drills.\n\nAustin also joined the fray declaring: \"Every country, large or small, has the right to enjoy its own maritime resources. The harassment the Philippines has faced is dangerous, pure and simple.\"\n\nChinese Defence Minister Dong responded on Sunday condemning the formation of \"exclusive military alliances\" and attempts to create \"bloc confrontation.\" He continued: \"Various small circles targeting other countries cannot make our region safer and can only cause more tension.\"\n\nDong accused Washington of \"hegemonic behaviour,\" declaring that the \"relevant countries should abandon their zero-sum mindset, arrogance and bias and treat regional countries with sincerity.\" Without mentioning the US, he accused the Philippines of being emboldened by outside powers to break bilateral agreements [with China] and make premeditated provocations.\n\nThe defence minister declared that \"China has exercised great restraint,\" but warned that \"there is a limit to our restraint.\" In particular, he condemned Manila's decision to allow the US to station mid-range missiles in the region for the first time since the Cold War.\n\nThe exchanges between Chinese officials and those from the US and its allies have been escalating over the past decade as Washington has ramped up its confrontation with Beijing. The presence of Zelensky, however, condemning China and touting for support for the war against Russia is a sharp warning the brutal war that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives already is rapidly developing into a wider conflict not just in Europe, but in Asia and throughout the world.\n\nRead moreStop the US-NATO escalation toward nuclear war!

China, which has refused to attend the Swiss summit, insists on a peace conference with equal participation from both Russia and Ukraine. Zelensky and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin accused China of supplying \"dual use\" items to Russia, a claim China denies. The US is also increasing its military presence in the Indo-Pacific, forming alliances like AUKUS and the Quad, and heightening tensions with China over territorial disputes in the South China Sea and Taiwan.

        "title": "Analysis: China and Trump loomed large at Singaporean defense summit",
        "body": "Any tourist wandering through the glitzy lobby of Singapore's Shangri-La Hotel this weekend would have stumbled on a rather bizarre scene.\n\nMilitary officers from around the world thronged the halls of the luxury hotel, their shoulders dripping with gold braids and epaulets, complicated colored bars lined up on the chests of their dress uniforms like some martial game of Tetris.\n\nEvery few minutes a defense minister strode purposely through the mix, surrounded by a phalanx of aides and escorts.\n\nThis gathering is an annual spectacle that to the uninitiated might seem surreal. But the topics being discussed here are deadly serious.\n\nThe annual Shangri-La Dialogue is one of the few places in the world where you can watch warriors who spend their careers preparing for armed conflict, engaged in polite, carefully-moderated debate.\n\nThe stakes this year could hardly be higher.\n\nWar rages in both the Middle East and Europe. Meanwhile China's increasingly assertive moves has much of the Asia-Pacific on edge.\n\nThe Singapore summit brought key players together.\n\nWhere else would you have the President of the Philippines, a nation whichdo has seen its vessels increasingly targeted by Chinese coast guard ships in the disputed South China Sea, deliver a keynote address on the same stage that, two days later, Beijing's new Defense Minister makes his debut appearance?\n\nThere was even a surprise appearance from Ukraine's embattled president Volodymyr Zelensky - and a first face-to-face meeting between US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his Chinese counterpart Adm Dong Jun.\n\nGiven its location in the city-state of Singapore, events in Asia - and in particular China's behavior in the region - stalked the conference.\n\nIn his keynote speech, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. issued a stark warning about the ongoing confrontations between Philippine and China Coast Guard vessels in a contested part of the South China Sea.\n\n\"If a Filipino citizen is killed by a willful act,\" he said, \"that is I think, very, very close to what we define as an act of war.\"\n\nTwo days later, China's Adm Dong fired back from the same stage, accusing the Philippines of \"blackmail\" in the maritime dispute.\n\n\"There is a limit to our restraint,\" said Admiral Dong Jun.\n\n\"I saw that as a threat,\" said Dewi Fortuna Anwar, a research professor at Indonesia's National Research and Innovation Center who has been attending the Shangri-La Dialogue since its founding twenty-one years ago.\n\n\"In decades past, the Chinese only came in a small number and they were extremely quiet,\" she said. \"Now they're very self confident...they intervene in all the sessions.\"\n\nThe open nature of the Shangri-La Dialogue provides delegates with a unique opportunity to ask blunt questions of speakers.\n\nAfter his speech on Sunday, China's Dong received many questions from audience members on Beijing's increased threats towards self-governing Taiwan as well as its disputed claims in the South China Sea, and he replied in unapologetic terms.\n\nThe \"separatists\" in Taiwan's newly-elected government would be \"nailed to the pillar of shame in history,\" he said.\n\nBut equally, Chinese military officers also used Q&A sessions at other key moments to make their views known.\n\nSenior Colonel Yanzhong Cao of China's People's Liberation Army asked US Secretary of Defense asked US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin whether the US was trying to build a NATO-like alliance in the Asia-Pacific region, adding the claim \"the eastward expansion of NATO has led to the Ukraine crisis.\"\n\n\"I respectfully disagree,\" Austin replied, the audience in the ballroom then erupting into a rare burst of applause.\n\n\"The Ukraine crisis obviously was caused because Mr. Putin made a decision to unlawfully invade his neighbor,\" Austin continued. \"This was brought on because of a decision by Mr. Putin.\"\n\nLater that day, Ukrainian leader Zelensky got a borderline rock star welcome when he made a surprise appearance at the conference, dressed in his trademark fatigues and black t-shirt.\n\n\"We stand with you,\" Ng Eng Hen, Singapore's minister of defense, later said to Zelensky.\n\nBut the large contingent of Chinese army officers present at other sessions was notably absent during Zelensky's speech and the Ukrainian leader said he failed to secure a one-on-one meeting with Chinese officials during his Singapore visit.\n\nHe also accused Beijing of aiding Ukraine's mortal enemy.\n\n\"With China's support to Russia, the war will last longer. That is bad for the whole world, and the policy of China - who declares that it supports territorial integrity and sovereignty and declares it officially. For them it is not good,\" Zelensky told journalists.\n\nIt was not clear whether Zelensky succeeded in securing new support for Kyiv from non-aligned south-east Asian countries like Malaysia and Indonesia.\n\nInstead, Indonesian president-elect and retired general Prabowo Subianto - the new leader of the world's most populous Muslim majority nation - spent much of his speech calling for an end to the on-going carnage in Gaza and an investigation into recent Israeli attacks that killed dozens of displaced civilians in Rafah.\n\nAnother political elephant in the room was what direction might the United States be heading in.\n\nThe Singapore gathering began just hours after a 12-person jury in a court-room in New York City convicted former US President Donald Trump on of all 34 counts of falsifying business records in his hush money criminal trial.\n\nAsia is watching very closely for whether Trump will return to office in November and what impact that might have on the world's most populous continent and a region already fraught with very real geopolitical fault lines.\n\nIn a sign of clear discomfort with the news, a US lawmaker Michael McCaul, Chairman from the House Foreign Affairs Committee, abruptly cancelled filming a previously scheduled interview with CNN.\n\nHis fellow Republican Senator Dan Sullivan also requested not to discuss Trump during a meeting with journalists, instead directing reporters to a press release.\n\n\"This is a very sad day for American and the rule of law,\" Sullivan's statement said, calling the verdict a \"gross abuse of our justice system.\"\n\nBut speaking to journalists, the Senator from Alaska also celebrated what he called America's \"commitment to liberty and democracy,\" saying this marked a competitive advantage over \"authoritarian aggression led by China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.\"\n\nSullivan was part of a bi-partisan delegation seeking to demonstrate Congressional commitment to US allies in Asia.\n\n\"The dictators we are allied against...are ally poor,\" Sullivan said.\n\nBut there are clearly concerns about US reliability.\n\nAn academic from Japan - Washington's closest ally in Asia - asked defense chiefs from Singapore and Malaysia about Trump's possible re-election. He called it a \"nightmare\" scenario.\n\nThat triggered nervous laughter from the audience and on stage.\n\nSingapore's Dr. Ng Eng Hen gamely responded, \"we will work with any administration in any country if we can find common ground.\"\n\nI vividly remember collective nervousness at the 2017 Shangri-La Dialogue, held just months after Trump's inauguration.\n\nTrump's then secretary of defense James Mattis clearly sought to reassure American defense partners worried about the new mercurial president.\n\n\"Bear with us,\" Mattis told the audience, after being asked whether the \"America First\" commander-in-chief would contribute to the destruction of the post-World War II order.\n\n\"Once we've exhausted all possible alternatives, the Americans will do the right thing. We will still be there.\"\n\nSeven years later, uncertainty over the political future of the US is just one of many challenges facing policy makers.\n\nOne by one, the leaders of armies and navies shared their fears about climate change, nuclear proliferation, wars in Europe and the Middle East and concerns that a miscalculation between the US and Chinese militaries could spiral out of control\n\n\"The world cannot withstand a third geopolitical shock,\" Singaporean defense chief Dr. Ng warned, after invoking the Gaza and Ukraine conflicts.\n\nIn this tense geopolitical environment, it's far better for commanders to put on their dress uniforms and rub shoulders in the halls of a five-star hotel, than aim at each other over gun barrels on the battlefield.",

        "summary": "The Philippine military has denied Chinese allegations that its troops pointed guns at Chinese Coast Guard vessels near the Second Thomas Shoal in the South China Sea. Military spokesperson Francel Margareth Padilla emphasized that Philippine personnel acted professionally and followed rules of engagement. A 29-second video showed a masked man briefly holding an object resembling a rifle. China claims most of the South China Sea, a region also claimed by several other countries, including the Philippines. The Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled in 2016 that China's claims have no legal basis. Tensions between the Philippines and China have escalated recently, with incidents involving water cannons and alleged ramming of Philippine vessels by China."

        "body": "Toshi Yoshihara, an American expert on China’s military, called for Malaysia to reject Beijing’s ‘excessive claims’ over the disputed waters\n\nPrioritising short-term trade benefits instead of addressing the territorial conflict could cost Malaysia dearly in the long run, he argues\n\nMalaysia should take a more proactive approach to defending its rights in the South China Sea, an American expert on China who has advised the Pentagon warned – urging the Southeast Asian nation to reject Beijing’s “excessive claims” over the disputed waters and protect its own long-term strategic goals.\n\nPrioritising short-term trade benefits poses serious risks that could ultimately result in greater long-term costs, said Toshi Yoshihara, a senior fellow at the Washington -based Centre for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments think tank who has written extensively on China’s military and maritime policy.\n\nHe said these costs could come in various forms, from economic penalties to loss of territorial integrity and increased regional instability, undermining Malaysia’s national interests and security.\n\n“Accommodating China is basically paying later with extra penalties, and frequently the penalty will come in the form of blood, sweat and tears,” Yoshihara told This Week in Asia on Monday, a day before he was expected to brief the National Defence University of Malaysia on the same topic.\n\nThe resource-rich waters of the South China Sea are claimed by Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines and Vietnam. China’s claims over the disputed waters, demarcated on Beijing’s maps by its “nine dash line”, crosses into all of these countries’ exclusive economic zones.\n\nAlthough the boundaries of exclusive economic zones are upheld by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and a 2016 arbitral decision in The Hague, China has dismissed these international rulings in favour of what it claims to be its historical rights over the region.\n\nChina has repeatedly encroached into the waters of Malaysia’s exclusive economic zone, particularly around Sabah and Sarawak. These incursions, often involving Chinese coastguard ships, have intensified in recent years following the discovery of significant oil and gas reserves.\n\nYoshihara’s comments came in response to remarks made last month by former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad, which were widely interpreted as a call to let China’s claims over the disputed waters go unchallenged.\n\n“They [China’s government] claims that the South China Sea belongs to them, but they have not stopped ships from passing through,” Mahathir said at the Nikkei Future of Asia conference in Tokyo last month.\n\n“As long as there is no stoppage of the passage of ships through the South China Sea, then it’s good enough.”\n\nWith Malaysia’s economy heavily reliant on trade from both the United States and China, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has been accused of playing down Chinese vessels’ encroachments into Malaysian waters, asserting that his country has no issues with Beijing.\n\nSpeaking in Melbourne at the Asean-Australia summit in March, Anwar said Western nations were trying to dictate Malaysia’s stance on China\n\n“If they have problems with China, they should not impose it upon us. We do not have a problem with China,” Anwar said.\n\nChina has been Malaysia’s largest trading partner for the past 15 years, currently accounting for some 17 per cent of the country’s total trade volume.\n\nYoshihara, author of the 2022 book Mao’s Army Goes to Sea, which details the founding of the Chinese navy and the start of Beijing’s maritime and island-building campaigns, suggested that Kuala Lumpur could learn from Manila about how to “deal with peacetime coercive intimidation tactics” in the South China Sea.\n\nManila’s tactics include documenting its maritime territorial conflicts with Beijing. He noted that the Philippine navy has been releasing footage of its clashes with the Chinese coastguard around the Second Thomas Shoal, which Yoshihara described as a “public relations disaster” for China.\n\nDuring several clashes, Chinese ships have shot high-pressure water cannons at Philippine forces, resulting in vessels being damaged and crewmen being injured.\n\n“The violent force of the water cannons suggested they can inflict casualties and perhaps even death. China is sort of struggling to deal with this new narrative,” Yoshihara said.\n\nAt the Shangri-La Dialogue security forum in Singapore on Friday, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr said the death of any of his citizens or servicemen would come very close to constituting “an act of war” – and vowed to respond accordingly.\n\n“Once we get to that point, certainly we would have crossed the Rubicon. Is that a red line? Almost certainly it’s going to be a red line,” Marcos Jnr said.\n\nIn response, China asserted its claims over the South China Sea and accused Manila of jeopardising the security and stability of the region through its close ties with the US, including the placement of mid-range missile systems in the Philippines as part of a joint military exercise in April.\n\n“China has exercised great restraints in the face of such infringements and provocations,” said Chinese Defence Minister Dong Jan at the forum.\n\nThe Philippines, a former US colony, signed a mutual defence treaty with Washington in 1951, dictating that both nations would support each other if either were attacked by an external party.",

Yoshihara suggested Malaysia could learn from the Philippines' approach to documenting and publicizing maritime conflicts with China. The South China Sea is a contested region with claims from Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines, Vietnam, and China, which has dismissed international rulings in favor of its historical claims.

        "title": "Defending Japan and the Philippines Is Not Entrapment",
        "body": "The United States has a strong interest in standing with its allies against Chinese expansionism.\n\nIn August 2013, US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel declared while in Manila that the US-Philippines alliance is \"an anchor for peace and stability\" in the region. In October of the same year, US Secretary of State John Kerry emphasized in Tokyo that the \"US-Japan alliance is the cornerstone of peace and prosperity in Asia Pacific.\" Notwithstanding these bold pronouncements from high-ranking US officials, some in America have expressed concerns over the possibility of entrapment in case the two US allies' separate disputes with China turn violent. Some are concerned that Washington could get dragged into a war with China over tiny islands that the US has no national interest in. Others argue that Washington's long-standing policy of strategic ambiguity should be applied on the East and South China Seas in order to deter the Chinese from changing the relevant status quos, and the Japanese and the Filipinos from getting too emboldened. These beg two important questions. First, will militarily defending Japan and the Philippines over their disputes with China really mean entrapment of the US? Second, will ambiguity in American security commitments to Tokyo and Manila result in an outcome in favor of peace and stability?\n\nRegarding the first question, it is important to dissect what the East and South China Sea disputes involve.\n\nOn the East China Sea dispute, it must be noted that it was only in 2008 when China started to send civilian law-enforcement vessels to the territorial waters of the islands in contention. In retrospect, this was the start of Beijing's attempt to revise the status quo of the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands. Over the years, the frequency of incursions increased dramatically. Recently, such attempt to alter the status quo was extended to the relevant airspace with China sending paramilitary aircraft and declaring an air-defense identification zone. In 2010, Beijing used economic coercion to prevent Tokyo from sentencing a Chinese fishing trawler captain who deliberately rammed his ship into Japanese Coast Guard vessels. Furthermore, the Senkaku/Diaoyu dispute involves maritime boundary questions. This is significant because the East China Sea is an important sea lane, where energy and trade for South Korea and Japan pass through. It is also a strategic common that is the gateway to mainland East Asia and an immediate connection to the South China Sea, a very important choke point.\n\nOn China's dispute with the Philippines, it must be noted that Beijing's ambiguous \"nine-dash line\" claim effectively turns much of the South China Sea, including areas long considered part of the global commons, as China's own territorial waters. Given that $5.3 trillion worth of trade passes through the South China Sea every year, $1.2 trillion of which is US trade, the significance of the dispute between Manila and Beijing cannot be underestimated.\n\nBeijing has been using coercion and intimidation to change the status quo of the islands and maritime domains in the South China Sea. In 1995, Chinese forces occupied and built a garrison on the Mischief Reef, a submerged maritime feature located 129 nautical miles west of a major Philippine landmass and 599 nautical miles southeast of Hainan, the nearest Chinese landmass. Under customary international law and its codified version, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), submerged maritime features cannot be claimed by any state as a territory under its sovereignty. Hence, their control is dependent on whichever exclusive economic zone (EEZ) or continental shelf they are located. Moreover, in 2012, China also successfully flipped the status quo of the Scarborough Shoal, another maritime feature within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone, after a tense standoff. Quite recently, China has been attempting to eject Manila's military presence in the Second Thomas Shoal, another submerged maritime feature within the Philippines' UNCLOS-mandated continental shelf. In March 2014, China twice implemented a blockade which tried to prevent the Philippine military from provisioning and rotating its troops in the shoal. Months prior to those incidents, China has been sending naval frigates and civilian maritime law enforcement vessels to contested waters in an apparent attempt to intimidate the Philippine government.\n\nAll of these reveal two issues. First, the disputes in the East and South China Seas involve a rising revisionist power trying to alter the status quo, not by the rule of law or peaceful, nonhostile means, but by intimidation and coercion. Second, the disputes involve not just the islands themselves, but maritime domains critical for the control of valuable trade routes and strategic commons.\n\nWhat then do these two issues mean for the United States? They mean that militarily defending Japan and the Philippines is not simply giving a favor to longstanding allies. It's not entrapment. Clearly committing to their defense means defending two important US national interests: 1) the rule of law, and 2) securing freedom of navigation and unimpeded lawful commerce in very strategic trade routes and critical choke points. These two alone are enough justifications for Washington to clearly stand by with its two Pacific allies.\n\nRegarding the second question, it is obvious that America's \"strategic ambiguity\" has not been effective in preserving East Asian status quo. Strategic ambiguity is not a wise answer to China's approach of \"salami slicing\" and \"talk-and-take\" policy in East Asian seas. China has shown that it is not interested in signing a binding code of conduct in the South China Sea nor in clarifying its claims to be in line with UNCLOS. While both Philippine president Benigno Aquino and Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe have been repeatedly stressing the importance of upholding the rule of law, Beijing has been continually rejecting multilateral platforms and international arbitration for resolving disputes. Recent incidents indicate that China is becoming more inclined to use intimidation, coercion and even force against its neighbors to attain its objectives.\n\nWith all these, Washington should be very specific with its security commitments to both Tokyo and Manila, before it's too late. If Japan doubts the security guarantee of its US alliance, the ramifications would be deleterious. Other American allies would consequently also doubt the US. Why? Because if the US could consider an abandonment of the world's third largest economy, what guarantee is there that Washington would not do the same to other allies? In a way, the US-Japan alliance is the ultimate measure of America's rebalance to Asia. Furthermore, doubts in the US-Philippines alliance are more likely to embolden China to use force since, unlike Tokyo, Manila has a weak military and a significantly lower deterrent capability.\n\nAmbiguity also increases miscalculation and could result in a vicious arms race. On the one hand, China might perceive the two US alliances as not very credible -- resulting in military adventurism. On the other hand, Japan and the Philippines might perceive the ambiguous US commitments to be too weak a security guarantee and so result in an overshoot of military buildup, increasing regional tensions further. Those are just a few possible consequences of US commitments being open to interpretation, in addition to others that can exacerbate the already tensed geopolitical and security landscape of the region.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is understandable for some to put an emphasis on America's economic relations with China, Washington should be clear with its treaty allies in the Pacific for reasons outlined above -- promoting the rule of law, preserving freedom of navigation and unimpeded lawful commerce, and protecting strategic global commons and critical chokepoints. These are indispensable and long-term US national interests. Being clear with its security commitments could drastically restrain China from further destabilizing revision of relevant status quos and deter it from using threat or force, while at the same time reducing the security uncertainties of US allies and smaller powers in East Asia. The US-Japan and the US-Philippines alliances, would then be the cornerstone and an anchor, respectively, of peace and stability in the region -- not an entanglement.",

        "summary": "The article argues that the United States has a strong interest in defending Japan and the Philippines against Chinese expansionism in the East and South China Seas. It highlights past statements by US officials emphasizing the importance of these alliances for regional stability. Concerns about potential US entrapment in conflicts over disputed islands are addressed by examining China's aggressive actions to alter the status quo through coercion and intimidation, which threaten critical trade routes and strategic maritime domains.\n\nThe article asserts that defending Japan and the Philippines aligns with US national interests in upholding the rule of law and ensuring freedom of navigation. It criticizes the US policy of strategic ambiguity, suggesting it has failed to deter China's incremental territorial advances and has increased regional tensions. Clear security commitments to Tokyo and Manila are recommended to prevent miscalculations, deter Chinese aggression, and reassure other US allies. The article concludes that such clarity would promote peace and stability in the region, rather than entrap the US in unwanted conflicts."

Zelenskyy then flew to Manila early morning yesterday.\n\nIn his keynote address in Singapore, Marcos hit out at what he described as the \"illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive actions\" being taken in the disputed South China Sea, though he did not directly name Beijing.\n\nTensions have been boiling between Beijing and Manila during these past months, as the China Coast Guard has been firing water cannon on Philippine ships sending supplies to troops stationed at a remote outpost at a disputed shoal.\n\nZelenskyy, meanwhile, held a separate press briefing in Singapore and accused China of allegedly helping Russia thwart the peace summit in Switzerland.\n\nDuring their meeting, Marcos told Zelenskyy that the Philippines is looking forward to working together with Ukraine in forging peace.\n\nHe also welcomed Ukraine's plan to open an embassy in the Philippines later in 2024.\n\n\"That's certainly very good news because we would very much like to continue to help, in any way, that the Philippines can through multilateral (channels) and (the) United Nations, and even through other agencies such as the European Union,\" said Marcos.\n\nHe then reiterated the Philippines' support for Ukraine in its war against Russia.\n\n\"We will continue to do all that we can to promote peace and to bring an end to the fighting and to come to a political resolution of your country,\" Marcos said.\n\n\"I think everybody fully understands that it is easier said than done, and it will be a difficult road to find our way back to the situation that is morally acceptable not only to Ukraine, but to the rest of the world.\"\n\nIn November 2022, the Philippine leader had described Russia's invasion of Ukraine's territories as \"unacceptable\" and asked both nations to resolve the conflict in a diplomatic manner.\n\nThe Philippines also voted in favour of a UN General Assembly resolution condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nZelenskyy thanked Manila for its continued support.\n\n\"We're very thankful to be in here in your country which supports Ukraine, our territorial integrity and sovereignty.\n\n\"Thank you so much for your 'big word' and clear position about us, about this Russia occupation of our territories,\" he said. -- The Straits Times/ANN",

It's inhumane!\" Sen. JV Ejercito told the Inquirer in a Viber message.\n\n\"These are already extreme hostilities being displayed by the Chinese government. We need to ask allies to come to our aid during this very sensitive situation,\" he said.\n\nCiting Geneva Conventions\n\nSen. Nancy Binay said the CCG brazenly flouted international treaties and protocols, including the humanitarian treatment of wounded and ailing soldiers under the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their Additional Protocols.\n\nThe American Red Cross issued a summary in 2011 explaining this set of international treaties as being applicable not only in armed conflicts, but also in instances of occupation by another nation's troops.\n\n\"These actions [by the China Coast Guard] show the outright disregard of the paramount principle of humane treatment and compassion and violate the protocols of the Geneva Conventions on the treatment of the wounded and sick,\" Binay said.\n\n\"The obstruction of medical aid to our personnel is an affront to these international norms and human dignity,\" she also said.\n\nThe Philippines is ready to bring these incidents to the attention of international bodies, including the United Nations, she added.\n\n\"We will continue to stand firm in our resolve to protect our people and our sovereignty. The safety and well-being of our citizens will always be paramount,\" Binay said.\n\nSen. Francis Tolentino agreed with Binay and suggested the filing of a case against China before the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea.\n\nAny case that the Philippines may file should also include China's unlawful activities which have resulted in environmental degradation and the destruction of marine resources, he said.\n\n\"They have actually violated several specific treaties and conventions,\" Tolentino said. \"Their responses are all related. And these could be signs of desperation on the part of China.\"\n\n'Human rights violations'\n\nSen. Juan Edgardo Angara said the CCG's reported actions \"endanger... the lives of our Filipino troops stationed at the Ayungin Shoal and could be deemed as a violation of their human rights.\"\n\nSen. Risa Hontiveros said \"China's continued wanton disregard for valuable food resources is now on full display. It's not only the natural resources that they are wasting but also the food supply for our troops.\"\n\n\"Also deplorable is their blockade of a medical mission for the soldiers. Despicable and callous,\" she added.\n\n\"I trust that the Department of National Defense will reinforce our soldiers stationed [at] Ayungin Shoal. We will not allow China to relentlessly demean our troops, our people,\" Hontiveros said.\n\nSen. Joel Villanueva said President Marcos was right in branding as \"deceptive\" China's actions in the West Philippine Sea.\n\nReaction to speech\n\nIn his speech on May 31 before the Shangri-La Dialogue, an international defense forum in Singapore during his working visit there, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. criticized the \"illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive actions\" in the disputed waters but did not name China.\n\nChina, nevertheless, reacted to Marcos' speech, with its foreign ministry saying on Monday that \"It is very clear to the discerning eye who the Philippines is serving in its foreign policy and for whom it is working in its maritime operations.\"\n\n\"I like the word 'deceptive' because that's what China has been doing for quite some time,\" Villanueva said in a press briefing on Monday. \"No one believes in their circus. [China's] narrative is ridiculous and their claims are unfounded.\"\n\nSen. Ramon Revilla Jr. said, \"In no uncertain terms, what they are doing is inhumane.\"\n\n\"We are taking notice of the bullying and provocations against our countrymen and our nation. International law and comity between states must prevail and all contrary actions by any state party should stop,\" he said.",

Carpio emphasized that this clarification corrects a long-standing misconception and bolsters the Philippines' territorial integrity amid ongoing disputes with China, which claims the majority of the South China Sea, including the West Philippine Sea, through its nine-dash line. Despite a 2016 Arbitral Award invalidating China's claims, China continues its aggressive actions in the region."

        "body": "China warned countries around the South China Sea to be skeptical of America's \"geopolitical self-interest\" and accused the U.S. of stoking tensions in the region at a weekend global security conference.\n\nThe warning from China's Foreign Ministry was in response to claims by Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. of \"illegal, coercive, aggressive, and deceptive actions\" in the contested waters, a reference to Beijing and its territorial disputes with Manila, South China Morning Post reported.\n\nMarcos made the comments at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual summit in Singapore that has long been the barometer for relations between China and the U.S.\n\nThis year, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun held talks.\n\nDong was clear that despite the two officials meeting, China remained opposed to U.S. influence and its alliance-building in Asia, specifically pointing out America's support for Taiwan.\n\n\"These malign intentions are drawing Taiwan to the dangers of war,\" Dong said. \"Anyone who dares split Taiwan from China will be smashed to pieces and court their own destruction.\"\n\nDong's comments illustrate how frayed U.S.-China relations remain as Beijing ups its presence in contested waters off the South China Sea and as both nations try to find a middle ground at sea and in the air that would prevent tensions from spiraling into an all-out crisis.\n\nChina called the U.S. out on its interests in the area and said it played \"an extremely dishonorable role\" by supporting and cooperating with the Philippine side's abusive acts and using the South China Sea issue to provoke tensions between Beijing and other regional countries.\n\nChina added it was \"crystal clear\" who the Philippine foreign policy and its maritime operations serve, pointing to the United States.\n\n\"Regional countries should remain highly vigilant in this regard and firmly hold the leading role of regional peace and stability in their own hands,\" Dong said.\n\nIn 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague slammed China's behavior in the South China Sea and found its claim to sovereignty over the waters had no legal basis, giving Brunei, Indonesia, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Malaysia more leverage in their maritime disputes with China.\n\nThe landmark case was brought by the Philippines and was seen at the time as an important crossroads in China's push for global dominance and its rivalry with the United States.\n\nChina dismissed the ruling as illegal and argued Manila's \"unilateral initiation of international arbitration\" without Beijing's consent \"violated international law.\"\n\nDong also called out U.S. military activities in the disputed Second Thomas Shoal and said its deployment of a missile system in the Philippines was a \"real threat to regional security.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nAs Dong slammed the U.S., Austin underscored the \"importance of respect for high-seas freedom of navigation guaranteed under international law, especially in the South China Sea.\"\n\nAustin, in a speech on Saturday, warned against \"actions in this region that erode the status quo and threaten peace and stability,\" and added that \"we all share an interest in ensuring that the South China Sea remains open and free.\"",

        "body": "We are all invited to two different kinds of 'Stag Do' (for those in the US, Bachelor Party), which (for those in Australia) are also a 'No-Bucks Night'.\n\nApril US personal consumption income and spending data on Friday saw the former up 0.3% m-o-m as expected, but spending 0.2%, a tick lower, and real personal spending -0.1% vs. 0.1%, meaning inflation was biting. The core measure was 0.2% m-o-m, in line, as were the Fed's-favoured PCE y-o-y deflator at 2.7% and the core at 2.8%, but they remain above the 2% target. However, the Chicago PMI that followed was a disaster at 35.4 vs. 41.6 expected, its lowest reading since Covid lockdowns of May 2020. New orders and order backlogs both fell to May 2020 levels, plunging 9.2 and 8 points, respectively.\n\nThe reaction saw US Treasury yields dropping and stocks rising despite inflation not falling. Recall our Fed-watcher Philip Marey has been warning the US is heading for stagflation - and the four rate cuts he expects to see over 2024 and 2025 will only be due to the 'stag' not the 'flation' part. Backing his view, the Daily Mail reports 'A 'perfect storm' is wiping out America's restaurants', with dining out declining as lifestyles are forced to shift by higher prices. Fortune adds, 'The housing market is finally seeing more inventory, but buyers aren't showing up as a 'cold reality is settling down'. That offers the potential prospect of lower activity and lower prices - if owners sell, and lose their current low mortgage rate, rather than the housing market just freezing, not clearing.\n\nThe RBA's Hunter says the \"first and predominant challenge\" is bringing inflation down; yet he cited the Reserve Bank's dual full-employment mandate to explain why they aren't (yet) raising rates again in order to do it. Meanwhile, as house prices continue to soar further even before rates do anything in either direction, the ABC stresses a 'hidden home loans crisis' as 2 in 5 Australians with mortgage debt, some 5.8m people, say they will have real difficulty making payments over the next 12 months. In short, parts of the economy say rates need to come down: but inflation says the opposite.\n\nThe same is true in weaker form in Europe. The ECB meeting on Thursday is almost certain to see rates cut by 25bp. However, our team notes, \"one cut is no cut\" in practical terms, and \"lingering inflation risks tilt the odds towards a slower or shorter cycle than expected.\"\n\nCentral banks will be glad to see that while OPEC+ extended its voluntary production cuts of around 2m barrels a day through to Q3, oil is declining in response. However, Saudi Aramaco selling $12bn in shares in brisk trade does not suggest a truly bearish climate for oil, regardless of the global climate. Meanwhile, plenty of other commodities are going sharply higher - and we know what would happen to them and oil were rates to come down before inflation does.\n\nSo, that's one kind of 'Stag Do'. The other kind is the clashing of antlers.\n\nDomestically, that means elections, with potential market impact. India's PM Modi will retain his parliamentary majority, building the China > India market mojo switch; South Africa's ANC lost its majority for the first time since the end of Apartheid, with the outlook now unclear; Mexico's Claudia Sheinbaum, successor to outgoing President Obrador, is expected to win, meaning policy continuity; and former US president Trump claims to have raised $52.8m from small donors in one day post-conviction, and $200m over three days including larger donations - he also joined TikTok and gained 1m followers in an hour.\n\nA Bloomberg survey says a Trump win is a risk to Fed independence, which would \"likely rock financial markets\". 44% of respondents say they expect him to politicize the Fed or limit its power vs. just 6% who say he will leave it alone, and 35% who think he will use social media to lean on it. 24% say a Trump win would immediately cause 10-year Treasury yields to rise more than 25bps, 23% say a smaller rise would occur, and 24% that yields would fall. By contrast, 54% think Biden will leave the Fed alone --a low number reflecting the structural shifts towards a political-economy I flagged would emerge to roil markets-- 41% think he would lean on the Fed to urge lower rates to some degree, and 5% think he'd do more than that, while not specifying.\n\nThis week also sees the EU elections, which our team recently published a report on in regards to Europe's attempts to respond to economic and geopolitical challenges by building 'strategic autonomy', with market-moving implications.\n\nInternationally, the tail risks are also market moving. In the Middle East, President Biden floated a new peace proposal that could either see de-escalation or, if it fails, re-escalation. Ukraine used western HIMARS to attack Russia proper, after TASS warned 'Full-scale war between Russia, West can't be ruled out, expert says'. President Zelenskyy accused China of helping Russia sabotage his plans for a peace summit and prosecute its war, economically. The Philippines warned a clash with China in the South China Sea could spiral into war, as China's defence minister countered of the \"limits\" to its restraint. China also warned about the formation of an \"Asian NATO\", as Zelenskyy visits Manila.\n\nEU foreign policy chief Borrell said he has seen no evidence of Chinese military support for Russia, and its help to Russia is not comparable to Iran and North Korea - true in drones and munitions, but not for overall aid to a war economy. He then added the EU doesn't have the ability to sanction third countries that circumvent Russian sanctions: unwilling, maybe, but it is surely able. By contrast, a Financial Times op-ed from Deputy US Treasury Secretary Adeyemo ('We need to put sand in the gears of the Russian war machine') argues, \"the private sector must play its part in Putin's military-industrial complex\", specifically mentioning Russia's imports of dual-use inputs. That suggests EU firms, and banks, will need to do more, and more broadly, not less on this front.\n\nUnavoidable military rearmament will require a lot of bucks; and greater use of third country sanctions may mean many have even fewer in hand.\n\nMeanwhile, against this backdrop, Bloomberg also reports: \"War in the Middle East and Europe, US-China tensions, climate change, threats from new technologies - geopolitical risk is everywhere. A coterie of fund managers are pitching a class of ETFs that claim to offer a hedge for all that uncertainty. These funds, ranging in size from $8m to $800m in assets, strip out companies the managers say threaten national security or are vulnerable to state takeover or US sanctions... Champions of these ETFs view them as a corrective to what they see as Wall Street's agnostic view of geopolitical developments... [using] publicly available information to screen companies on a range of criteria, including whether they're under sanctions, work in cybersecurity, have been accused of human-rights violations, or have operated in disputed waters near China.\"\n\nThe idea is a good one - but how do these ETFs account for information that isn't publicly available, or project the second, third, fourth, nth order impact of on apparently safe firms from the spectrum of potential, conflating political and geopolitical tail risks now emerging? Surely a broader variety of hedging tools are required which look at scenario analysis and 'then what(s)?', including of the market kind mentioned in the Bloomberg survey above?",

        "title": "'The King's Speech'",
        "body": "IN 2010, the historical drama film \"The King's Speech\" was played across movie theaters. It depicted the struggle of Britain's King George VI, played by actor Colin Firth, to deliver a speech on a radio broadcast in the face of an approaching war with Germany in 1939. Due to King George VI's stuttering impediment, he was coached by a speech therapist, played by actor Geoffrey Rush. The film was a blockbuster success, earning more than $427 million with a budget of only $15 million.\n\n\"The King's Speech\" resonated well with the world's movie audience because it showed how an underestimated would-be king stepped up and overcame his speech defects to shore up his people's courage against Nazi Germany's war machine. As King George VI ascended to the throne, his first broadcast speech strengthened his people's resolve to confront the greatest threat to their national existence since becoming an empire and reverse the fear sweeping the British archipelago.\n\nThere are strong similarities between King George IV's speech and President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s keynote address at this year's International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore. Pummeled by the \"new opposition\" for the past months, the President demonstrated his geopolitical acumen, diplomatic eloquence and strategic foresight on the tensions happening in the South China Sea. He clearly articulated the legal and diplomatic groundwork of how the Philippines would assert its sovereignty while recognizing Asean centrality and urging Washington and Beijing to responsibly manage their rivalry on the world stage.\n\nLike King George VI's speech directed at Nazi Germany, President Marcos faces China with fierce determination and does \"whatever it takes to protect our sovereign home to the last square inch, to the last square millimeter.\" In President Marcos' exchanges with the audience, he pointed out, \"If you want peace, prepare for war.\" It is inferred that the President is willing to go to war for our maritime territory to the extent that he warned Beijing that if any uniformed personnel or even a Philippine citizen were deliberately killed in a clash with the China Coast Guard, it would be considered an act of war.\n\nLately, opposition forces have humiliated President Marcos as a weak, incompetent and disconnected leader on the domestic problems of the nation. Some have even recklessly insinuated that the President is addicted to cocaine and is a henpecked husband. But his riveting speech in the IISS Shangri-la Dialogue doused all these venomous comments as irrelevant to the present national exigencies. He galvanized the Filipinos to shun divisions and implored that only as a united people could we confront China's illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive actions. \"I do not intend to yield. Filipinos do not yield,\" the President echoed.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nPresident Marcos' speech has received accolades from world leaders and diplomats. It is a watershed moment for all Filipinos as likened to \"The King's Speech.\" Compared to his predecessor who vacillated in the face of China's intimidation, the President was steadfast in defending our territorial claims \"where we must, by constitutional duty, and by legal right, protect our interests.\" His impressive performance in the IISS Shangri-la Dialogue made Filipinos proud, fearless and unyielding against China's claims.\n\nSo, how far do I think President Marcos is willing to go?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his speech, the President vowed to bolster the country's defenses and to ensure a credible military posture in the contested areas of the South China Sea. He is prepared to fight a superpower like China if the situation escalates into a regional conflict and promised not to lose \"an inch\" of our territory. It is anticipated that the US would gain more access to forward operating bases in the Philippines, positioning mid-range ballistic missiles that can reach across the Taiwan Strait. He is expected to strengthen regional defense cooperation with Japan, Australia, India and Vietnam to hedge against Chinese threats. But other than the drumbeats of war, President Marcos is also willing to pursue efforts toward regional peace and stability. He has not closed the door to resolve the territorial disputes in the South China Sea diplomatically.\n\nBut above all, his speech has sparked a national sentiment that unites a divided Filipino nation on a contentious issue. Taking the cue from his fiery message, he laid out the \"red line\" that he hoped China would not cross, and if it did, then the country would have to cross the Rubicon. Like the \"King's Speech,\" there is now more compelling reason for all Filipinos to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the President and fight for our national sovereignty against insurmountable odds.\n\nPresident Marcos has found his inner voice to truly lead and rally the Filipino people.",

        "summary": "The article draws a parallel between the 2010 film \"The King's Speech\" and President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s recent keynote address at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore. The film, which depicts King George VI overcoming his stutter to deliver a crucial speech during WWII, is likened to Marcos' speech, where he demonstrated strong geopolitical acumen and strategic foresight regarding tensions in the South China Sea. Despite facing domestic criticism, Marcos' speech was well-received internationally and galvanized national unity against China's aggressive actions. He emphasized the Philippines' determination to defend its sovereignty, even suggesting a willingness to go to war if necessary. Marcos also highlighted the importance of regional defense cooperation and left the door open for diplomatic resolutions. His speech has been seen as a unifying moment for the Filipino people, rallying them to stand firm against external threats."

        "body": "Volodymyr Zelensky is indefatigable in his diplomatic work.\n\nThe Ukrainian president tried to attend all the major summits or at least assert his presence via teleconferencing to appeal for aid and muster support for his besieged nation. He has addressed the US Congress, the European summit meetings and even the World Economic Forum in Davos.\n\nOver the weekend, he materialized in Singapore to speak before the Shangri-La security forum. His participation was unscheduled. The keynote speech in this year's forum was delivered by Philippine President Ferdinand R. Marcos.\n\nOn Monday morning, Zelensky landed in Manila to call on Marcos. The visit, while official, was unannounced and very likely hastily scheduled.\n\nZelensky was expected to personally invite Marcos to attend the Global Peace Summit soon to be held in Switzerland. This summit is being organized at Kyiv's initiative. He also wanted to personally thank Marcos for the Philippines' condemnation of the Russian invasion.\n\nKyiv is planning to establish an embassy in Manila soon. This will help consolidate our bilateral relations and enable us to expand areas of cooperation.\n\nNo nation is too distant, too small or too poor to escape Zelensky's relentless diplomacy. In Southeast Asia, Singapore and the Philippines have explicitly condemned Russian aggression in Ukraine.\n\nFor Ukraine, international support is vital to its survival as a nation. Broad international support will help enforce the sanctions imposed against Russia. It will help the besieged country scrape in as much material as it needs to frustrate the invasion.\n\nFor the Philippines, condemning the Russian invasion required a tough decision based on principle. The Philippines relies on Russia for critical raw materials, tourism inflows and possibly industrial investments. We are prepared to forego all these to help a struggling nation stand up against aggression.\n\nRecently, the Philippines found some spine in standing up to China's bullying. In President Marcos' keynote speech at the Singapore summit, he underscored our determination to assert our exclusive economic zone. He stressed that the international community has a stake in keeping the vital sea lanes running through the South China Sea open to commercial navigation.\n\nThe more assertive foreign policy adopted by the Marcos government increased our geopolitical profile. Other European countries have expressed their interest in forging security alliances with us. We are now seen as a major regional player in pushing back China's expansionist designs.\n\nRecently, President Marcos was invited to the White House for a tripartite summit with Japan's prime minister. That summit sets the groundwork for an effective regional alliance. It likewise produced numerous investment commitments to support Philippine development.\n\nThe foreign policy posture we now maintain vis-a-vis China will probably cost us billions in Chinese investments and assistance. But it establishes us as a reliable voice in strengthening a rules-based global order.\n\nOur foreign policy posture pits us against the transactional relations Beijing cultivates with some of our Southeast Asian neighbors. That makes us a thorn on China's side.\n\nOur foreign policy posture is magnified by rising tensions at the Taiwan Strait. Many analysts believe that Beijing is ready to forcibly incorporate Taiwan as a province of China against the will of its democratic citizens. The only way to avert that is to show that neighboring countries will be ready to defend Taiwan in the event of an attack from the mainland.\n\nTaiwan and the Philippines, like Ukraine, are standing up to bullying neighbors. We have no desire to fall into some undeclared Chinese sphere of influence in the region. We are strongly committed to democratic governance.\n\nTaiwan and the Philippines, like Ukraine, are prepared to stand our ground in the face of aggression. Convenience cannot be more important than principle.\n\nMost of our ASEAN partners are all too willing to pander to China for short-term commercial gains. The Philippines has been unable to get ASEAN support for its South China Sea claims because of this pandering. We have to seek support for our position from beyond the regional partnership.\n\nPresident Marcos' international profile improved dramatically since he adopted a tougher stance towards Beijing's claims. His is an increasingly important voice in a global community working to establish a rules-based international order. That should reap its own benefits further down the road.\n\nChina must eventually come around to appreciating our position favoring a rules-based international regime if she is interested in de-escalating regional tensions. It is not the Philippines that should come around to submitting to China's transactional diplomacy.\n\nZelensky sees through China's claims of neutrality in the Russia-Ukraine war. He understands that Beijing will be Moscow's most reliable ally as Russia slides towards isolation. In fact, he believes China has been actively campaigning to discourage other countries from participating in the Global Peace Summit.\n\nOver the next few months, Russia will be even more dependent on Chinese supplies of technology needed to keep up its war of aggression. China will increasingly put its trading networks at the service of Russian exports bottled up by sanctions.\n\nThat means, whether we like it or not, Ukraine and the Philippines become partners in breaking the power of the axis of tyrants seeking to redefine global politics according to its terms. We are destined to be allies of common fate in helping each other deter aggressive neighbors.\n\nZelensky's decision to visit Manila may appears spontaneous. The contrary is true. It is the outcome of a profound reading of the strategic realignments now happening.",

Zelensky's relentless diplomacy underscores the importance of international support for Ukraine's survival and the enforcement of sanctions against Russia. The Philippines, under Marcos, has adopted a more assertive foreign policy, particularly against China's territorial claims, enhancing its geopolitical profile and attracting interest from European countries for security alliances.\n\nMarcos' stance has led to significant investment commitments and a tripartite summit with Japan and the US, despite potential economic costs from reduced Chinese investments. The Philippines' firm position on democratic governance and a rules-based international order aligns it with Ukraine and Taiwan against regional aggressors. Zelensky's visit to Manila reflects a strategic understanding of global realignments and the shared challenges faced by Ukraine and the Philippines in countering authoritarian influences."

Marcos, Jr.\n\nChina is willing to continue to work with members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) including the Philippines to manage differences at sea and deepen sea-related cooperation, it said.\n\nMr. Marcos on Friday delivered the keynote address at a security forum in Singapore, criticizing what he described as illegal, coercive and aggressive actions by \"other actors\" in the South China Sea -- a censure of China, although he didn't name the country.\n\nMeanwhile, Senator Emmanuel Joel J. Villanueva dismissed a Chinese general's accusation that the Philippines is ruining regional peace by involving more countries in the sea dispute, saying the claim was not backed by proof.\n\n\"I don't think anyone is paying attention to what they are doing because no one believes in their (China) circus,\" he told a news briefing.\n\n\"Their narratives are ridiculous, their claims are unfounded, and we still go by our united stand that the West Philippine Sea is ours,\" he added, referring to areas of the South China Sea within Manila's exclusive economic zone.\n\nThe Chinese Embassy in Manila did not immediately reply to a Viber message seeking comment.\n\nAt the Shangri-la Dialogue security summit in Singapore last week, Chinese Major General Xu Hui, commandant of the Chinese military's International College of Defense Studies, asked Mr. Marcos if the Philippines was risking regional peace by involving other parties.\n\nHe said Manila risked ruining the \"long-earned, long-lasting peace\" within ASEAN.\n\n\"There is no such thing as a regional issue any longer, and when we talk about the South China Sea, we have to also remember that the South China Sea is the passageway for half of world trade,\" Mr. Marcos responded. \"Peace and stability in the South China Sea and freedom of navigation in the South China Sea is a world issue.\"\n\nMore than $3 trillion worth of trade passes annually through the sea, which China claims almost in its entirety. A United Nations-backed tribunal in 2016 voided its claim for being illegal.\n\n\"In the end, the important thing is that we don't give up sovereignty over those islands and oceans,\" Senate President Francis \"Chiz\" G. Escudero separately told reporters.",

        "body": "MANILA (The Straits Times/ANN): The Philippines is attending the upcoming peace summit in Switzerland on the Ukraine war, disclosed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky following his surprise meeting with his Philippine counterpart Ferdinand Marcos Jr in Manila on June 3.\n\nThe two leaders met just two days after Mr Zelensky's unscheduled visit to Singapore during the Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia's premiere defence forum, where he asked Asia-Pacific leaders to join the summit on June 15 and 16 aimed at bringing peace to his war-torn country.\n\n\"We discussed the inaugural Global Peace Summit and the importance of South-east Asian countries being represented there. I am pleased that the Philippines will participate in the summit,\" Mr Zelensky posted via his official account on social media platform X.\n\nIt remains unclear for now if Mr Marcos himself will attend the summit, or if a ranking official will be sent instead.\n\nThe two presidents were supposed to meet on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue at the weekend, but their schedules did not sync. Mr Zelensky then flew to Manila in the early morning of June 3.\n\nBoth leaders criticised China during the security forum, which was held amid growing tensions between Beijing and Manila over the South China Sea territorial dispute as well as the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nIn his keynote address in Singapore, Mr Marcos hit out at what he described as the \"illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive actions\" being taken in the disputed South China Sea, though he did not directly name Beijing.\n\nTensions have been boiling between Beijing and Manila during these past months, as the China Coast Guard has been firing water cannon on Philippine ships sending supplies to troops stationed at a remote outpost at a disputed shoal.\n\nMr Zelensky, meanwhile, held a separate press briefing in Singapore and accused China of allegedly helping Russia thwart the peace summit in Switzerland.\n\nDuring their meeting, Mr Marcos told Mr Zelensky that the Philippines is looking forward to working together with Ukraine in forging peace.\n\nHe also welcomed Ukraine's plan to open an embassy in the Philippines later in 2024.\n\n\"That's certainly very good news because we would very much like to continue to help, in any way, that the Philippines can through multilateral (channels) and (the) United Nations, and even through other agencies such as the European Union,\" said Mr Marcos.\n\nHe then reiterated the Philippines' support for Ukraine in its war against Russia.\n\n\"We will continue to do all that we can to promote peace and to bring an end to the fighting and to come to a political resolution of your country,\" Mr Marcos said.\n\n\"I think everybody fully understands that it is easier said than done, and it will be a difficult road to find our way back to the situation that is morally acceptable not only to Ukraine, but to the rest of the world,\" he added.\n\nIn November 2022, the Philippine leader had described Russia's invasion of Ukraine's territories as \"unacceptable\" and asked both nations to resolve the conflict in a diplomatic manner.\n\nThe Philippines also voted in favour of a UN General Assembly resolution condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMr Zelensky thanked Manila for its continued support.\n\n\"We're very thankful to be in here in your country which supports Ukraine, our territorial integrity and sovereignty. Thank you so much for your 'big word' and clear position about us, about this Russia occupation of our territories,\" he said. - The Straits Times/ANN",

        "title": "Facing up to China's Hybrid Warfare in the Pacific",
        "body": "The China Coast Guard is expanding its reach in the Pacific, part of a broader campaign to increase Beijing's security role in the region.\n\nThis year, for the first time ever, the People's Republic of China registered 26 China Coast Guard (CCG) vessels to operate in the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission Convention Area. The Convention manages 20 percent of the globe, from the Aleutians in the North Pacific, all the way down to the Southern Ocean.\n\nIt is also the area of the First, Second, and Third Island Chains.\n\nThe CCG, widely used for gray-zone operations in disputed waters, will soon legally be allowed to board any foreign fishing vessels on the high seas in the First, Second, and Third Island Chains.\n\nSince 2020, China has also had four Coast Guard vessels registered to monitor foreign fishing vessels in the North Pacific Fishing Commission Area. Starting from June this year, China will have the third largest maritime security presence patrolling throughout the whole of the Pacific, after the United States and Australia.\n\nThe CCG is the maritime branch of the People's Armed Police of China, which is led by the Central Military Commission of China. Its vessels are built to People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) specifications. The Coast Guard operates directly under the PLAN in a time of war.\n\nIn a steady process of attrition, Xi Jinping's China is challenging the existing strategic order, and doing so through acts below the threshold of warfare.\n\nChina is using multiple channels, and notably dual-use military-civil activities, to normalize and legitimize its growing military and intelligence presence in the Pacific. China's hybrid warfare activities are now the most significant traditional security threat in the Pacific. Xi has made it clear that Beijing does not share the values of the rules-based international order and has been telling the Chinese people to prepare for war.\n\nFor more than 70 years the sea lines of communication and chokepoints of the Pacific have been protected under the strategic denial policy of the United States and its regional security partners, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\nThe United States and its partners' strategic denial set up was one of the lessons-learned recommendations after World War II. It is aimed to exclude adversaries that do not share the same security interests and values from establishing a military presence in the Pacific.\n\nThe inherent weakness of the policy has always been that the many small island developing states within the Pacific benefit from the security guarantee but have no alliance commitment to it. There is no military agreement that binds the Pacific island nations together, though the 2000 Biketawa and 2018 Boe Declarations state that any security challenges in the region should be dealt with collectively.\n\nIn the Xi Jinping era, China has aggressively targeted states along the First, Second and Third Island Chain with gray-zone activity, foreign interference, and repeated attempts to set up a China-centered security alliance for the region.\n\nBut China's actions did not just begin when Xi came to power. For more than 24 years, the PLA has been providing in-depth training, doctrine, weapons, military vehicles and vessels, uniforms, and military buildings to the military forces of Tonga, Fiji, and Papua New Guinea. China's domestic intelligence agency, the Ministry of Public Security, has signed secret cooperation agreements with police departments in Fiji, Kiribati, Vanuatu, and Solomon Islands. PLAN vessels have been visiting the Pacific for 20 years for both military diplomacy and spying trips. The PLA is also accessing the Pacific by using PLA vessels and planes for humanitarian and disaster relief.\n\nA global military power requires friendly ports, airfields, and satellite ground stations in foreign countries. From Kiribati to Vanuatu to French Polynesia, Beijing-connected companies have repeatedly tried to gain access to militarily significant airfields and ports. China has been thwarted in all those efforts.\n\nInstead, over the last 10 years, funded by the Asian Development Bank and World Bank, China's state-owned enterprises have built the bulk of all strategic airports, ports, and ring roads in the island developing nations of the Pacific.\n\nChina's government sponsors foreign interference activities in every state and territory of the Pacific, which has a corrosive effect on local politics. That makes it hard for states to defend themselves against China's malign activities that affect their sovereignty such as illegal, unreported, unregulated (IUU) fishing.\n\nChina's distant-water fishing vessels without doubt the worst offenders for illegal fishing in the waters of the Pacific. For years China has been ranked by the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime as the number one IUU fishing state in the world. China's distant-water fishing fleet is also ranked the worst in the world for human trafficking. The Chinese industrial fishing vessel illegal drift nets kill everything in their path, leaving nothing for local fisher folk. Chinese government documents describe the foreign territorial waters and high seas these vessels operate in as China's \"distant water fisheries,\" part of an entire industrial chain.\n\nWithin China's distant-water fishing fleet hides a state-subsidized maritime militia, which works in tandem with the CCG and PLAN to haze and intimidate maritime states such as Vietnam and the Philippines over territorial disputes. The Biden administration have labelled China's IUU fishing fleet, and their role as a maritime militia acting with with China's maritime security forces, as a \"national security concern.\"\n\nChina's aggressive gray-zone activities operate below the threshold of traditional warfare, making it difficult to get the political will for a coordinated response. However, the 2018 Boe Declaration redefined the concept of security in the Pacific region and highlighted the principle of non-interference in the domestic affairs of Pacific Island Forum Members.\n\nNow is the time for its signatories, the developing island states of the Pacific, and Australia and New Zealand, to work collectively to face up to the challenge of China's hybrid warfare in the Pacific, in the same way they are now working collectively to address the main nontraditional security challenge in the region, climate change.\n\nThe continued peace and security of the Pacific depends on it.",

Instead, Chinese state-owned enterprises have built significant infrastructure in these nations, funded by international banks.\n\nChina's distant-water fishing fleet, notorious for illegal fishing and human trafficking, operates as a state-subsidized maritime militia, working with the CCG and PLAN to assert territorial claims. The Biden administration has labeled this fleet a national security concern.\n\nThe 2018 Boe Declaration calls for collective action against security challenges in the Pacific, including China's hybrid warfare. The region's continued peace and security depend on a coordinated response from Pacific island states, Australia, and New Zealand."

        "body": "Chinese foreign ministry says Washington has played ‘extremely dishonourable role’ by supporting Manila’s ‘abusive acts’ in contested waters\n\nIt comes in response to Shangri-La Dialogue speech by Philippine president denouncing ‘illegal coercive’ actions in territorial disputes\n\nChina urged countries around the South China Sea to be wary of Washington’s “geopolitical self-interest” and maintain autonomy to keep the region stable.\n\nThe statement by China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs was in response to Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr’s remarks on Friday at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, where he decried “illegal coercive, aggressive and deceptive actions” in the contested waters – an apparent reference to Beijing and its territorial disputes with Manila, though he did not mention China by name.\n\nThe Chinese foreign ministry said the Philippines was “solely responsible” for the recent escalation in the South China Sea.\n\nIt also took aim at the United States, saying the country had played “an extremely dishonourable role” by supporting Manila.\n\n“The United States, out of geopolitical self-interest, has played an extremely dishonourable role by supporting and cooperating with the Philippine side’s abusive acts and using the South China Sea issue to provoke tensions between China and regional countries.\n\n“At present, it is crystal clear who the Philippine foreign policy and its maritime operations serves … Regional countries should remain highly vigilant in this regard and firmly hold the leading role of regional peace and stability in their own hands.”\n\nBeijing said it was willing to continue to cooperate with members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), including the Philippines, to manage differences and deepen maritime cooperation, according to the statement.\n\n“With the joint efforts of China and Asean countries, the situation in the South China Sea has remained generally stable. The freedom of navigation and overflight enjoyed by all countries in accordance with the law poses no problem,” it added.\n\nIn his speech at the opening of the Shangri-La Dialogue, Marcos stressed the importance of upholding international law in asserting Manila’s claims in the South China Sea and referred to a “binding” 2016 ruling by a tribunal at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, which rejected Beijing’s territorial claims over the waters.\n\n“Any effort to resolve maritime differences in the East China Sea and the South China Sea must be anchored in international law,” Marcos said in the speech, adding that “we must … respect legally settled rights”.\n\nChina views the international tribunal’s ruling as illegal and has argued that Manila’s “unilateral initiation of international arbitration” without Beijing’s consent “violated international law”.\n\n“China did not accept or participate in the South China Sea arbitration case … nor accept any claims or actions based on the ruling. China’s territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea will not be affected by the ruling under any circumstances,” the ministry said.\n\nChina claims most of the South China Sea, but the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei have competing territorial claims over the resource-rich waterway.\n\nSince Marcos took office two years ago, the Philippines has been the most assertive country in the region in countering Beijing’s territorial claims in the disputed waters.\n\nDespite not having any territorial claims in the South China Sea, Washington is committed to upholding freedom of navigation in the waters and supporting its Southeast Asian allies, including the Philippines.\n\nIn his meeting with US counterpart Lloyd Austin on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue, Chinese Defence Minister Dong Jun accused the US of endangering security in the region with its support of the Philippines.\n\nHe said US military activities in the disputed Second Thomas Shoal – known as Renai Jiao in Chinese and Ayungin Shoal in the Philippines – and its deployment of a missile system in the Philippines were “a real threat to regional security”.\n\nAustin, on the other hand, underscored the “importance of respect for high-seas freedom of navigation guaranteed under international law, especially in the South China Sea” during his talks with the Chinese defence chief, according to a Pentagon statement.",

British police accused them of providing \"articles, notes, documents or information\" to foreign countries, while China called the claims \"malicious slander.\"\n\nA former Royal Marine accused of assisting Hong Kong intelligence was found dead earlier this month, police said.\n\nBeijing and several Western countries are increasingly accused of espionage.\n\nChina did not say how it uncovered the incident involving Mr. Wang and Mr. Zhou, saying only that it came after a \"thorough investigation.\"\n\nChinese authorities claimed MI6 agents took advantage of Mr Wang's \"strong desire for money\" and befriended him on campus by posing as a graduate, enticing him to provide \"paid consulting services\".\n\nAfter a period of time, the agents assessed that \"the situation was ripe\" and asked him to serve the British government in exchange for better pay and security offers, China's Ministry of State Security claimed.\n\nMI6 agents hired Mr Zhou to spy for China through Mr Wang, he added.\n\n\"The king hesitated at first, but could not resist.

        "body": "Dong Jun warns that there are limits to Beijing's restraint in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait.\n\nBy RFA Staff 2024.06.02 -- Chinese Minister of National Defense Dong Jun launched an acerbic attack on what he called the \"hegemonic powers\" behind tension in the Asia-Pacific, a clear swipe at the United States and its allies.\n\nIn an address to the annual Shangri-La Dialogue security forum in Singapore, Adm. Dong said that people in the Asia-Pacific are \"independent and self-reliant,\" and were \"against any attempt to turn our countries into vassal states or draw us into bloc confrontations.\"\n\n\"Our people have firmly rejected infiltration, sabotage and coercion by outside forces,\" the minister said, adding that regional countries \"despise those who attempt to bolster themselves by taking orders from hegemonic powers.\"\n\nDong also said China had exercised great restraint in the face of what he called \"infringements and provocations\" but warned \"there is a limit to our restraint.\"\n\nBeijing has repeatedly accused Washington of assisting Taipei and Manila to stand up to its assertive actions in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea.\n\nThe Pentagon last month deployed an intermediate range missile system in the Philippines during the annual Balikatan military drills, which Beijing condemned as bringing \"huge risks of war into the region.\"\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives has recently passed an $8-billion package to help Taiwan boost its defense capabilities against China.\n\nDong said that \"some external interfering forces keep hollowing out the One China principle with the salami slicing strategy.\"\n\n\"They have cooked up Taiwan-related legislations and continued to sell arms to Taiwan and have illegal official contacts with it.\"\n\nThe minister, who took office five months ago after his predecessor was removed over suspected corruption, went on a lengthy tirade against Taiwanese leaders who he called \"Taiwan independence separatists.\"\n\nChina considers the democratic island one of its provinces and Dong said that China \"will take resolute actions to curb Taiwan independence and make sure such a plot never succeeds.\"\n\nHe accused Taiwan's leaders of \"betrayal of the Chinese nation and their ancestors,\" and said they would be \"nailed to the pillar of shame in history.\"\n\n\"The Taiwan question is at the core of China's core interests,\" the minister said. \"Anyone who supports Taiwan independence will only end in self-destruction.\"\n\nDefense analyst Malcolm Davis from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, or ASPI, said that Dong \"made clear a willingness for China to use force to prevent independence and respond to any external forces involved in supporting Taiwan.\"\n\n\"It was a fairly predictable speech and very much the 'party line' with little in the way of new comments. In effect this was a propaganda speech and not an accurate statement of Chinese policy,\" Davis said.\n\n'Wolf warriors'\n\nBut Dong's tone did seem more combative than that of his predecessor, Li Shangfu, he added.\n\n\"On the South China Sea, he issued a warning that China won't rule out the use of force specifically in relation to the Philippines and the support of the United States,\" the Canberra-based analyst said, \"That suggests to me that China does intend to escalate the crisis, and has singled out the Philippines as their focus with the goal being to coerce Manila to capitulate to Chinese interests.\"\n\nUnlike Li and his predecessors, Dong is not a member of the Central Military Commission of the Chinese communist party - the highest national defense organization.\n\n\"That may be the reason behind Dong's tough statements to show his clout and get a promotion,\" said an Asian analyst who didn't want to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue.\n\nA Chinese academic praised Dong's speech and said his attendance at the conference helped bring \"China's real voice\" to the world.\n\n\"The Shangri-La Dialogue as a major security forum bears a great relevance to China,\" said Gao Zhikai, vice president of the Center for China and Globalization and chair professor at China's Soochow University. \"It is important that China's voice, which is increasingly in sharp contrast to that of the U.S., be heard.\"\n\nSeveral other Chinese delegates also promoted Beijing's views at the forum, in a forthright manner known as \"wolf warrior\" diplomacy.\n\nThe term, adopted from the title of a Chinese movie, describes an assertive, even aggressive, approach to international relations.\n\nMaj. Gen. Xu Hui, president of the International College of Defense Studies at China's National Defense University, confronted Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. after the latter's keynote speech on Friday, saying that Manila was risking ruining the \"long-earned, long-lasting peace\" within ASEAN by responding to Chinese vessels' activities in the disputed South China Sea.\n\nOn Saturday, another Chinese delegate, Senior Col. Cao Yanzhong, a researcher at China's Institute of War Studies, questioned U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin about the U.S. alliance system in the region which Beijing compares to \"an Asian version of NATO.\"\n\nDuring a session on 'Maritime Law Enforcement and Confidence Building' on Saturday, another Chinese delegate, Senior Col. Ge Hanwen, associate professor at the College of International Studies at China's National University of Defense Technology, blamed the Philippines for \"dramatically\" raising tensions in the region and Japan for using water cannons first in a confrontation at sea.\n\nAustin and Dong met for about an hour at the conference on Friday for talks aimed at improving their communications, a U.S. official said.\n\nNew regional order\n\nA Western observer at the forum, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Radio Free Asia that the Chinese delegates are \"on a mission to spread Beijing's messages and their statements are pre-scripted and pre-approved by the [communist] party.\"\n\nBeijing-based Gao denied that.\n\n\"It is only normal that people from all walks of life, including military officers, talk about the topics of their interest,\" Gao said.\n\n\"China attends a lot of international forums because we believe in having our voice heard by as many people as possible.\"\n\nDong acknowledged that different countries had different security interests and goals but he implied that China had a leadership role, said the ASPI's Davis.\n\n\"He kept pushing the implication that China speaks for the region in terms of shaping the future of Asia-Pacific security order,\" Davis said.\n\n\"China is clearly setting the basis for trying to assert its dominance over ASEAN, and if it can get [the] Philippines to submit to Chinese power through military coercion, then Beijing will expect other ASEAN states to also accept China's interests,\" said the Australian analyst.\n\n\"By default, China would then dominate the region.\"\n\nOver the past decade, the Chinese military has become more powerful, with its rapid growth bringing a new confidence, especially in relation with the United States.\n\nThe Center for Strategic and International Studies said in a recent report that China is the world's largest shipbuilder with a capacity some 230 times larger than the U.S.\n\n\"One of China's large shipyards, such as Jiangnan Shipyard, has more capacity than all U.S. shipyards combined,\" the center said in its report.\n\n\"China is way ahead of the U.S. in many aspects and the Chinese economy is soon to be larger, too,\" Gao, who served as a translator for Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping during the 1980s, told RFA.\n\n\"The Americans are worried about a rising China, that Beijing will impose its ideological and political system on the U.S.,\" he said, while adding that in his opinion, that fear was unfounded.\n\n\"No one can really decouple from China and the best Washington can do is to deal with China on an equal footing.\"\n\nLyle Goldstein from the U.S. think tank Defense Priorities said that Beijing was \"not reckless or aggressive,\" and despite the threats, it had not used force since the 1980s.\n\nDespite a downward spiral in U.S.-China relations, Goldstein suggested that the two countries and their militaries, \"should meet halfway and resolve disputes through diplomatic compromise.\"",

He condemned U.S. military support for Taiwan and the Philippines, accusing them of provoking China. Dong's speech, seen as more combative than his predecessor's, suggested China's readiness to use force to prevent Taiwan's independence and to assert dominance in the region. Analysts noted that Dong's statements might be aimed at solidifying his position within China's defense hierarchy. The forum highlighted China's assertive \"wolf warrior\" diplomacy, with Chinese delegates challenging U.S. and Philippine positions. The event underscored China's growing military confidence and its ambition to lead the Asia-Pacific security order, potentially coercing ASEAN countries to align with its interests."

        "body": "China's defense minister has warned the US over the deployment of ballistic missiles in the Asia-Pacific region, stressing that there are \"limits\" to Beijing's restraint in dealing with such acts of provocation in the South China Sea.\n\nDong Jun raised the alarm at an international security forum in Singapore on Sunday in a clear reference to the United States and the Philippines, which have been boosting their military ties to contain what they claim to be China's growing military might and influence in the strategic body of water.\n\n\"China has maintained sufficient restraint in the face of rights infringements and provocation, but there are limits to this,\" Dong told the Shangri-La Dialogue, which is attended by defense officials from around the world.\n\nThe two longstanding treaty allies, the United States and the Philippines have been working to consolidate their alliance and partnership in the Asia-Pacific region, which has enraged Beijing.\n\nThe US Army said in April that it had deployed a Mid-Range Capability missile system capable of firing the Standard Missile 6 (SM-6) and the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile in the northern Philippines for annual joint exercises.\n\nDong said the deployment of \"medium-range ballistic missiles\" was \"severely damaging regional security and stability.\"\n\nManila and Beijing have a long history of maritime territorial disputes in the South China Sea but tensions have worsened under Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, with Manila pivoting to Washington, which supports the country in its maritime dispute with China.\n\nChina rebuked the Philippines in a statement in February for its unfriendly maneuvers in the South China Sea, saying Manila \"stirs up trouble\" by holding joint air patrols with \"extraterritorial countries.\"\n\nChina's Southern Theater Command underlined that it had coordinated with its frontline naval and air forces to closely monitor the Philippines' joint military maneuvers.\n\nChina's claim of sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea overlaps with the maritime claims of the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam and Brunei, in addition to, Chinese Taipei, also known as Taiwan.\n\nAlso, China has constructed several artificial islands over the past few years in the Spratly archipelago in the South China Sea, which is a marginal sea of the Western Pacific Ocean. The move has drawn harsh criticism from the Philippines and the United States.\n\nThe South China Sea is believed to sit atop vast reserves of oil and gas.\n\nBeijing ready to 'forcefully' stop Taiwan's independence\n\nAddressing the three-day annual forum, Dong also warned that the Chinese military is ready to \"forcefully\" stop Taiwan independence.\n\nDong reiterated Beijing's position that Taiwan is part of China and expressed commitment to peaceful reunification.\n\n\"The Chinese People's Liberation Army has always been an indestructible and powerful force in defense of the unification of the motherland, and it will act resolutely and forcefully at all times to curb the independence of Taiwan and to ensure that it never succeeds in its attempts,\" China's defense minister said.\n\n\"Whoever dares to split Taiwan from China will be crushed to pieces and suffer his own destruction.\"\n\nDong also blamed separatist forces for eroding the \"One China\" principle, which states Beijing's view that it has sovereignty over Taiwan.\n\nIn a meeting with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Friday, Dong emphasized Beijing's demand that the United States should not support Taiwan independence by providing military aid to Taipei in any shape.\n\nHowever, Austin told the forum on Saturday that Washington would maintain its presence in the Indo-Pacific region by forging military alliances with regional countries.\n\nBeijing had cut its military-to-military communications with the United States in 2022 in response to then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.\n\nBeijing considers Chinese Taipei as one of mainland China's provinces with no right to establish diplomatic relations with other states. China's globally-accepted \"one China\" principle, which the United States has accepted, keeps Taiwan out of most international bodies.\n\nChina never supplied arms to parties in Ukraine war\n\nElsewhere, Dong told the Shangri-La Dialogue that Beijing has not supplied weapons either to Russia or to Ukraine and strictly controls exports of dual-purpose goods since the war began in the former Soviet republic.\n\n\"We have never supplied weapons to either party in the conflict. We have established strict control over exports of dual-purpose and never did anything that could fire up the situation,\" the defense minister said.\n\nChina is always holding a reliable position on the Ukrainian issue and supports peace talks, Dong added.",

        "summary": "China's Defense Minister, Dong Jun, issued a stern warning to the United States regarding its deployment of ballistic missiles in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in the South China Sea. Speaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, Dong emphasized that China's restraint has limits in the face of what it perceives as US provocations. This warning comes amid increasing military cooperation between the US and the Philippines, which has angered Beijing.\n\nThe US recently deployed a Mid-Range Capability missile system in the northern Philippines for joint exercises, a move that China claims undermines regional security. Tensions between China and the Philippines have escalated under Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, who has strengthened ties with Washington.\n\nDong also reiterated China's readiness to \"forcefully\" prevent Taiwan's independence, asserting that Taiwan is part of China and criticizing separatist forces for undermining the \"One China\" principle. He urged the US not to support Taiwan militarily.\n\nAdditionally, Dong clarified that China has not supplied weapons to either Russia or Ukraine since the onset of the conflict in Ukraine, maintaining strict control over dual-purpose exports and advocating for peace talks.\n\nKey points:\n- China warns the US over missile deployment in the Asia-Pacific.\n- Increased US-Philippines military cooperation has angered Beijing.\n- China is prepared to act forcefully against Taiwan independence.\n- China denies supplying weapons to parties in the Ukraine conflict."

        "title": "China's approach to global security elaborated at Shangri-La Dialogue",
        "body": "Defense minister reiterates firm stances on Taiwan question, South China Sea issue\n\nBy Li Aixin and Guo Yuandan in Singapore and Liu Xuanzun in Beijing Published: Jun 02, 2024 06:42 PM Updated: Jun 02, 2024 11:21 PM\n\nChinese Defense Minister Dong Jun on Sunday introduced China's approach to global security on the closing day of the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, as he offered Chinese thoughts on resolving global security issues with a global perspective, while reiterating China's firm stances on the Taiwan question and the South China Sea issue.\n\nIn his speech at a plenary session at the Shangri-La Dialogue on Sunday, Dong said that China's vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind, together with the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative, echoes the trend of history and responds to the longing of people around the world for a better life.\n\nThe Chinese military stands ready to work with other counterparts to deepen security cooperation and make more contributions to safeguard lasting peace and common prosperity in the Asia-Pacific as well as the world, said the Chinese Defense Minister.\n\n\"People in the Asia Pacific are committed to harmony and peace, are independent and self-reliant, and always support each other through thick and thin. We will not allow hegemonism and power politics to undermine the interests of Asia Pacific countries. We will not allow anyone to bring geopolitical conflicts or wars whether hot or cold, into our region. We will not allow any country or any force to create conflict and chaos in our region,\" he said.\n\nThe Chinese side is willing to work with all parties to protect the legitimate security interests of all countries, build a more just and reasonable international order, give full play to regional security architecture, advance open and pragmatic defense cooperation, set an example of maritime security cooperation, strengthen security governance in emerging areas, create a new situation of regional security cooperation, and continue to make the Asia Pacific an anchor for global development and stability, Dong said.\n\nZhang Chi, an associate professor at the National Defense University of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), told the Global Times on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue on Sunday that Dong's speech was pitched at an overarching global perspective, ranging from history to reality, from Asia to the world, and explained how China as always stands ready to pursue common security and common prosperity with all other countries, offered Chinese thinking and elaborated on Chinese efforts to tackle the current regional security issues.\n\nCompared with the speech delivered by US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin on Saturday, Dong's speech stood at regional and global heights focusing on the entirety of humanity, Zhang said, noting that Austin focused mainly on the US and its allies and partners in the region, revolved only around its own egoistic and selfish interests, and ignored the centrality of ASEAN in regional cooperation.\n\nThe core of Austin's speech is that the US aims to achieve leadership in the \"Indo-Pacific\" region through initiatives such as AUKUS, the Quad and other military alliances, while also subtly hinting at the creation of an \"Indo-Pacific version of NATO,\" which is a flawed strategic understanding and misguided perception of security that experts said engenders turmoil, conflict and even war, instead of fostering security and stability.\n\nGiven the ongoing conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, the Asia Pacific is one of the few regions in the world that still enjoys stability today. It is clear which global security approach, China's or the US', fits more the core interests and legitimate security concerns of the most countries, observers said.\n\nChina values peace and harmony, pursues common security, upholds equality and mutual respect, and emphasizes openness and inclusiveness, but it also firmly safeguards its core interests, Dong said in his speech.\n\nOn the South China Sea issue, Dong said that the current situation in the South China Sea is generally stable. He urged a certain country to see where its true interests lie, and return to the right track of dialogue and consultation.\n\nChina has exercised enough restraint in the face of infringements and provocations, but there is a limit, Dong warned, without naming the Philippines, which has frequently trespassed into waters off Chinese islands and reefs in the South China Sea since August 2023 under the instigation of the US. It has seen its provocations dealt with by the China Coast Guard (CCG) through legitimate, professional and restrained restrictive measures.\n\nOn the Taiwan question, Dong stressed that safeguarding China's national sovereignty and territorial integrity is the sacred mission of the Chinese military. \"We will take timely and resolute actions to stop 'Taiwan independence,' and make sure their attempts never succeed,\" he said.\n\nLieutenant General He Lei, former vice president of the Academy of Military Sciences of the PLA, told the Global Times on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue on Sunday that China's approach to global security also covers the South China Sea and the Taiwan Straits.\n\nChina remains committed to peaceful reunification, but under the instigation of external interfering forces, the Taiwan authorities are now unilaterally changing the status quo on the one-China principle, which is the biggest threat to peace and security in the Taiwan Straits, bringing risks of conflict and war, He Lei said, urging the \"Taiwan independence\" secessionist forces to learn from Dong's elaboration on China's approach to global security, see itself as a part of a community with a shared future, and reunify with the motherland as soon as possible.\n\nThe same applies for the South China Sea disputes, as countries should resolve disputes through peaceful talks and negotiations and safeguard the security in the region through joint efforts, said He Lei.\n\nChanges needed\n\nWhen answering a question and introducing China's stance on the Taiwan question, Dong was interrupted by the moderator, but he insisted on finishing his elaboration.\n\nThe experts noted that the Shangri-La Dialogue this year had a fierce \"crossfire\" of stances, starting by the arrangement that the keynote speech was delivered by Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr on Friday.\n\nParticipants said that the forum was staged to suppress and smear China, particularly this year.\n\nCao Yanzhong, a research fellow at the Academy of Military Sciences of the PLA, told the Global Times that the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), the organizer of the Shangri-La Dialogue, is a research institute serving British and US strategies, and all of its operation is backed by the US.\n\nAccording to the IISS' website, the sponsors of the Shangri-La Dialogue include some of the US' top arms dealers, including Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Northrop Grumman.\n\nWarwick Powell, adjunct professor at the Queensland University of Technology, told the Global Times at the forum that the Shangri-La Dialogue is a creature of history, as it emerged in a time when the countries of the Global South were voiceless, and questions of security, even in the Asia region and the Asia-Pacific more broadly, bore the marks of centuries of colonialism. Security in Asia was a question for colonial powers to come and talk about how they would maintain security in a region far from their own homes and how they would teach the locals about security.\n\n\"However, the world has changed, and I hope the Shangri-La Dialogue will respond to these changes and evolve accordingly,\" said Powell.",

        "body": "Durian demand and Chinese investors’ interest in the Philippines’ green-energy sectors seen as promising opportunities, according to China-based diplomats from the Southeast Asian nation\n\nBut analyst says that while China has ‘other trade options available’, there is a lack of ‘desirable trade alternatives’ for the Philippines\n\nDespite recent tensions between China and the Philippines, with the two sides increasingly squaring off over sovereignty claims in the South China Sea, diplomats are hoping to stem the tide of declining trade.\n\nThe Southeast Asian country will continue exploring the Chinese market’s interest in tropical agricultural products – including coconuts and highly sought-after durians – and wants to become more attractive to investors in sectors that China has seen come under mounting pressure from Western countries, according to a pair of Philippine diplomats based in China.\n\nAnd they said these areas could include renewable energy, green metals manufacturing, agribusiness and food process, as well as electric vehicles and lithium batteries that have faced scrutiny from Western countries.\n\n“The Philippines is committed to encouraging stable relations and close communication with regard to any issues related to bilateral trade and investments,” Emmanuel Ang, commercial counsellor of the Philippine embassy in China, told the Post by email.\n\n“We anticipate that our trade relationship with our largest trading partner will remain robust, stable and steadily growing in the coming years.”\n\nThe comments came as bilateral relations recently took another hit from Beijing’s fresh allegations in the territorial face-off at sea – contending that troops stationed on a grounded Philippine warship on a disputed reef in the South China Sea pointed guns at a Chinese coastguard patrol last month.\n\nIn 2023, China was the Philippines’ top importer and second-largest export destination after the United States, with a 23.3 per cent share of imports and 14.8 per cent share of exports, respectively, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority.\n\nIn the first four months of this year, the value of trade between China and the Philippines stood at US$22.46 billion, marking a 10.31 per cent year-on-year decline, according to Chinese customs data. In contrast, China’s trade value with the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) during the same period saw an 4.8 per cent year-on-year increase to US$$306.9 billion.\n\nThe shift has aroused speculation among analysts that the South China Sea dispute could be spilling over into trade relations.\n\nWhen meeting in Beijing in January 2023, Philippine and Chinese leaders agreed on four priority areas of cooperation, including infrastructure, agriculture, energy and people-to-people exchanges. At the time, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr said the hope was to move relations with China into “higher gear”, while seeking “to settle problems in a friendly manner”.\n\nHowever, rows have since escalated, with both sides increasingly confronting each other in disputed waters.\n\nAnd in February, Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs Enrique Manalo said Manila needed to find new trade opportunities to build economic resilience amid fears of trade sanctions from China.\n\nAng, with the Philippine embassy, attributed a 16 per cent year-on-year fall in last year’s bilateral trade value to an overall slowdown of trade.\n\n“China’s trade with the world, and also with Asean as a whole, also experienced declines,” he said, citing a weak external environment and downward trend of goods prices. Also, “China’s domestic consumption has yet to rebound to the pre-pandemic level”.\n\nNonetheless, Ang foresees burgeoning business opportunities as Philippine durians were granted market access to China starting last year, with traders “excited to supply to this new market” estimated to be worth around US$6 billion.\n\n“We also hope to increase exports of other agricultural products such as coconut products and marine products,” Ang said. “We also wish to increase the penetration rate of Philippine products in the Chinese e-commerce space, especially [food] products from Philippine [small and medium-sized enterprises].”\n\nIn terms of Chinese investment, he said: “We are encouraging them and helping with B2B, especially in the currently popular areas of renewable energy, renewable energy equipment manufacturing, iron and steel processing, green metals processing, electric vehicle- and battery-related businesses, agribusiness and food processing, and manufacturing.”\n\nTo mitigate any concerns out of the private sector, Ang said the Philippine embassy has increased efforts to organise and participate in various trade events, including the China-Asean Expo and the China International Import Expo, to showcase how bilateral trade and investments are developing healthily.There are many areas where China and the Philippines can complement each other in their economic and trade relationsVictor Gao, Centre for China and Globalisation\n\nGlenn Penaranda, commercial counsellor of the Philippine consulate general in Shanghai, said Philippine companies are continuing to pursue opportunities in China’s vast market, and such efforts have been underscored by Beijing’s charm offensive to lure back foreign investors after the pandemic.\n\n“We are currently working with several companies, and we are optimistic that collaboration in pursuing opportunities in our respective markets and in third markets will drive continued productive engagements,” he said via email.\n\nPenaranda also spoke to how Philippine companies are seeking partnerships with Chinese companies in areas including green metals, renewable energy, real estate infrastructure and related equipment.\n\n“There are many areas where China and the Philippines can complement each other in their economic and trade relations, which Manila’s foreign policy needs to take into account,” said Victor Gao, vice-president of the Beijing-based think tank Centre for China and Globalisation.\n\nThe Philippines is China’s 24th-largest trading partner, with annual bilateral trade of US$71.9 billion, behind France and ahead of Italy, Chile and Switzerland, according to Chinese custom data. China imports considerable quantities of Philippine pineapples, bananas, nickel ore and a type of coal called lignite.\n\nGao said that political frictions have already affected bilateral economic cooperation, with fewer state-owned enterprises investing in the Southeast Asian nation and numerous large-scale Chinese infrastructure projects in the country suspended since Marcos Jnr took office in June 2022.\n\n“China does not depend solely on the Philippines for specific imports, as it has other trade options available,” Gao said. “But it is more difficult for Manila to find more desirable trade alternatives.”\n\nAccording to Manila’s statistics agency, 60.83 per cent of the Philippines’ iron and steel was imported from China last year, compared with 48.34 per cent in 2018.\n\nEduardo Araral, an associate professor of public policy at the National University of Singapore, said nickel ore prices in the Philippines have dropped because “demand in China is slowing down”, and that competition from other Southeast Asian countries could be affecting fruit shipments to China.\n\n“If there’s a decline … Vietnamese suppliers have stepped up,” he said. “The supply from Vietnam has gone up, probably.”\n\nAnd Jonathan Ravelas, managing director of the Manila-based consultancy eManagement for Business and Marketing Services, said Chinese interest in Philippine fruits may have declined due to perceptions over “product quality” – stemming from either real issues or complaints arising from political disagreements.\n\nAt the height of bilateral tensions between the two countries during the Scarborough Shoal stand-off in 2012, Beijing imposed tighter controls and banned imports of bananas from the Philippines, alleging that they had mealybugs.\n\nThe shoal, known in China as Huangyan Island, is located within the Philippines’ 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone, but is claimed by China. It is one of several islets that the two countries dispute.",

        "body": "Sydney, Jun 3 (360info) COP28 signalled the 'beginning of the end' of the fossil fuel era. But more finance and a focus on equity can facilitate adaptation in vulnerable countries.\n\nNovember's COP29 in Azerbaijan does not seem likely to lead to more ambitious climate plans.\n\nAlso Read | Mumbai Local Train Services of Western Railway Hit Due to Technical Issues at Borivali Station: Live News Updates Today.\n\nWith ongoing geopolitical tensions, high interest rates, and upcoming pivotal elections in the US, the UK, and the European Union, countries will have the task of navigating climate goals while dealing with concurrent equity, socio-economic and geopolitical challenges.\n\nAt 2023's COP28 Summit, negotiations started on a high note, as the world finally agreed to move away from fossil fuels. Negotiators from 200 parties came together with a landmark agreement to increase climate action before the end of this decade to keep within the 1.5-degree Celsius target.\n\nAlso Read | Earthquake in Japan: Quake of Magnitude 5.9 on Richter Scale Strikes Ishikawa Prefecture, No Tsunami Threat.\n\nBut despite the first Global Stocktake finding the world is off-track in meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement, consensus on other key issues remained elusive, including the level of ambition in emission reduction targets.\n\nWhile some countries committed to aggressive targets in line with scientific recommendations, others stopped short, citing debt and ballooning costs as barriers to pushing for more ambitious goals.\n\nDespite calls for bold action, COP28 lacked clear commitments and timelines for a full coal phase-out. The Least Developed Countries Group, composed of representatives from 45 low-income countries, argued that COP28 outcomes reflected the lowest possible ambition that they could accept.\n\nThe need for increased climate finance\n\nUN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell called climate finance the \"great enabler of climate action\". COP28 had a promising start: The Green Climate Fund reached a record USD 12.8 billion from 31 countries with new pledges from Australia, Estonia, Italy, Portugal, Switzerland and the United States.\n\nBut as noted in the First Global Stocktake, this is far from matching the scale of funding needed to address the irreversible loss and damage risks affecting marginalised groups and people living in poverty in the Global South, estimated at USD 116-435 billion in 2020 to USD 1.1 to 1.7 trillion per year by 2050. These estimates do not include the non-economic loss and damage such as loss of social cohesion, cultural heritage and identity which are impossible to quantify.\n\nThe agenda for COP29 is set to focus on the New Collective Quantified Goals on climate finance. This refers to the commitment from developed countries to mobilise from a floor of USD 100 billion per year to address the needs and priorities of developing economies.\n\nDeliberations on the quantity, quality, and what these goals need to address are still underway and were described by Climate Action Network Europe as \"slow and unproductive\". COP29 should collectively and decisively come up with new financial goals that are in line with the needs of developing countries.\n\nEquity issues at COP29\n\nThere are also equity issues surrounding the upcoming COP.\n\nFor one, the Azerbaijani Government nominated an all-male organising committee for the conference, following the longstanding tradition of ignoring the important role that women play in climate action. This resulted in a strong and immediate backlash from the international community, prompting the government to add 12 women to its 41-member committee.\n\nCOP29 is hosted in an authoritarian petrostate known for its human rights violations against environmentalists and journalists. Amnesty International and others have called on Azerbaijan to commence meaningful reforms prior to COP29 and place human rights at its core.\n\nFossil fuel lobbyists might also be granted access to the negotiations, similar to what happened at COP28. The presence of the world's biggest polluters will have a significant influence on the COP presidency and participating parties.\n\nThere is also a worrying trend of some parties attempting to remove the language referencing the special circumstances of least developed countries and small island developing states.\n\nThe principle of special needs and circumstances is a fundamental element of the Paris Agreement and is more than necessary to advance climate justice. COP29 should put the needs and aspirations of these two groups at the forefront of proposed solutions.\n\nCalls for peace and financial transparency\n\nAmid the worsening geo-political tensions such as the territorial disputes in the South China Sea and the Israel-Gaza conflict, Azerbaijan is calling for peace and might ask the parties to observe a \"COP truce\" to prevent future climate-fuelled conflicts.\n\nThe President-designate of COP29, Mukhtar Babayev, has also called on low-income countries to be transparent over climate spending to develop trust.\n\nThis is all very ironic as the host country itself is accused of discrimination and ethnic cleansing of Armenians in the heavily contested Nagorno-Karabakh region, and is known for its lack of transparency and corruption in its oil and gas industry.\n\nWhile peace, stability and transparency are certainly important, these should not distract us from our sobering reality: we are not on track with our climate commitments, the impacts of climate change will only get worse, and the rich companies and fossil fuel companies should foot the climate bill.\n\nBabayev claims: \"I will build bridges between the diverging north and south to keep 1.5 degree C in reach.\"\n\nOne can only hope that this is not empty rhetoric.\n\nA 'real' transition away from fossil fuels requires concrete steps to fully stop fossil fuel, adequate financing to support the most vulnerable countries, and preferential treatment for least developed countries and small island developing states.\n\nUntil this is done, COP29 and other future COPs may continue to fall short.

COP28 saw a landmark agreement to increase climate action, but consensus on emission reduction targets was lacking. The Least Developed Countries Group criticized COP28 for its minimal ambition.\n\nClimate finance remains a critical issue, with the Green Climate Fund receiving record pledges but still falling short of the needed amounts. COP29 will focus on setting new financial goals to support developing countries, though progress has been slow.\n\nEquity issues are also prominent, with criticism of Azerbaijan's all-male organizing committee and its human rights record. The presence of fossil fuel lobbyists and attempts to remove language supporting least developed countries and small island states are concerns.\n\nAzerbaijan's call for peace amid geopolitical tensions and its own controversial actions in Nagorno-Karabakh highlight the complex backdrop of COP29. The article stresses that real progress requires concrete steps to phase out fossil fuels, adequate financing, and prioritizing vulnerable countries. Without these, future COPs may continue to fall short."

Illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive actions continue to violate our sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction,\" Mr Marcos said.\n\nEncounters between the Philippines and China in Asia's most contested waters have grown more tense and frequent during the past year, as Beijing presses its claims to shoals in waters that Manila says are well within its exclusive economic zone.\n\nChina's coast guard has stepped up so-called grey-zone activities such as use of water cannons, collisions and ramming tactics to try to stop Philippine resupply and patrol missions. It has also deployed fishing boats that the Philippines and its allies consider militia.\n\nThe Philippines, a treaty ally of the United States, is a key focus of Washington's efforts to strengthen alliances and partnerships in the Asia-Pacific region as it seeks to counter China's growing military might and influence.\n\nGiven its position in the South China Sea and proximity to self-ruled Taiwan, which China claims as its own, Philippine support would be crucial for the US in the event of any conflict.

The Philippines, a US treaty ally, is central to Washington's strategy to counter China's influence in the Asia-Pacific, especially given its strategic location near Taiwan.

        "title": "Finance and equity should be the core of COP29 talks",
        "body": "Sydney, Jun 3 (360info) COP28 signalled the 'beginning of the end' of the fossil fuel era. But more finance and a focus on equity can facilitate adaptation in vulnerable countries.\n\nNovember's COP29 in Azerbaijan does not seem likely to lead to more ambitious climate plans. With ongoing geopolitical tensions, high interest rates, and upcoming pivotal elections in the US, the UK, and the European Union, countries will have the task of navigating climate goals while dealing with concurrent equity, socio-economic and geopolitical challenges.\n\nAt 2023's COP28 Summit, negotiations started on a high note, as the world finally agreed to move away from fossil fuels. Negotiators from 200 parties came together with a landmark agreement to increase climate action before the end of this decade to keep within the 1.5-degree Celsius target.\n\nBut despite the first Global Stocktake finding the world is off-track in meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement, consensus on other key issues remained elusive, including the level of ambition in emission reduction targets.\n\nWhile some countries committed to aggressive targets in line with scientific recommendations, others stopped short, citing debt and ballooning costs as barriers to pushing for more ambitious goals. Despite calls for bold action, COP28 lacked clear commitments and timelines for a full coal phase-out. The Least Developed Countries Group, composed of representatives from 45 low-income countries, argued that COP28 outcomes reflected the lowest possible ambition that they could accept.\n\nThe need for increased climate finance UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell called climate finance the \"great enabler of climate action\". COP28 had a promising start: The Green Climate Fund reached a record USD 12.8 billion from 31 countries with new pledges from Australia, Estonia, Italy, Portugal, Switzerland and the United States.\n\nBut as noted in the First Global Stocktake, this is far from matching the scale of funding needed to address the irreversible loss and damage risks affecting marginalised groups and people living in poverty in the Global South, estimated at USD 116-435 billion in 2020 to USD 1.1 to 1.7 trillion per year by 2050. These estimates do not include the non-economic loss and damage such as loss of social cohesion, cultural heritage and identity which are impossible to quantify. The agenda for COP29 is set to focus on the New Collective Quantified Goals on climate finance. This refers to the commitment from developed countries to mobilise from a floor of USD 100 billion per year to address the needs and priorities of developing economies.\n\nDeliberations on the quantity, quality, and what these goals need to address are still underway and were described by Climate Action Network Europe as \"slow and unproductive\". COP29 should collectively and decisively come up with new financial goals that are in line with the needs of developing countries.\n\nEquity issues at COP29 There are also equity issues surrounding the upcoming COP. For one, the Azerbaijani Government nominated an all-male organising committee for the conference, following the longstanding tradition of ignoring the important role that women play in climate action. This resulted in a strong and immediate backlash from the international community, prompting the government to add 12 women to its 41-member committee.\n\nCOP29 is hosted in an authoritarian petrostate known for its human rights violations against environmentalists and journalists. Amnesty International and others have called on Azerbaijan to commence meaningful reforms prior to COP29 and place human rights at its core.\n\nFossil fuel lobbyists might also be granted access to the negotiations, similar to what happened at COP28. The presence of the world's biggest polluters will have a significant influence on the COP presidency and participating parties.\n\nThere is also a worrying trend of some parties attempting to remove the language referencing the special circumstances of least developed countries and small island developing states.\n\nThe principle of special needs and circumstances is a fundamental element of the Paris Agreement and is more than necessary to advance climate justice. COP29 should put the needs and aspirations of these two groups at the forefront of proposed solutions.\n\nCalls for peace and financial transparency Amid the worsening geo-political tensions such as the territorial disputes in the South China Sea and the Israel-Gaza conflict, Azerbaijan is calling for peace and might ask the parties to observe a \"COP truce\" to prevent future climate-fuelled conflicts.\n\nThe President-designate of COP29, Mukhtar Babayev, has also called on low-income countries to be transparent over climate spending to develop trust.\n\nThis is all very ironic as the host country itself is accused of discrimination and ethnic cleansing of Armenians in the heavily contested Nagorno-Karabakh region, and is known for its lack of transparency and corruption in its oil and gas industry.\n\nWhile peace, stability and transparency are certainly important, these should not distract us from our sobering reality: we are not on track with our climate commitments, the impacts of climate change will only get worse, and the rich companies and fossil fuel companies should foot the climate bill.\n\nBabayev claims: \"I will build bridges between the diverging north and south to keep 1.5 degree C in reach.\" One can only hope that this is not empty rhetoric. A 'real' transition away from fossil fuels requires concrete steps to fully stop fossil fuel, adequate financing to support the most vulnerable countries, and preferential treatment for least developed countries and small island developing states. Until this is done, COP29 and other future COPs may continue to fall short. (360info.org) GRS GRS",

        "summary": "The upcoming COP29 climate talks in Azerbaijan are expected to focus on finance and equity, crucial for aiding vulnerable countries in climate adaptation. Despite COP28's landmark agreement to move away from fossil fuels, significant challenges remain, including geopolitical tensions, high interest rates, and pivotal elections in major countries. COP28 saw a record USD 12.8 billion pledged to the Green Climate Fund, but this is insufficient compared to the estimated USD 1.1 to 1.7 trillion needed annually by 2050 for climate action in the Global South.\n\nEquity issues are prominent, with criticism over Azerbaijan's initial all-male organizing committee and its human rights record. The presence of fossil fuel lobbyists and attempts to downplay the needs of least developed countries and small island states are also concerns. COP29 aims to establish new financial goals aligned with developing countries' needs, but progress has been slow. Calls for peace and financial transparency are juxtaposed with Azerbaijan's own controversial practices. The success of COP29 hinges on concrete actions towards fossil fuel reduction, adequate financing, and prioritizing the most vulnerable nations."

        "body": "Philippine president’s stance on Ukraine-Russia war has pivoted from a neutral approach held when he was campaigning for office\n\nBrief meeting on Monday morning was sparked by both leaders missing each other at key security forum in Singapore over the weekend\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday made a surprise stop in the Philippines to meet President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr in his office at Malacanang Palace, where both leaders voiced their commitment to sovereignty and a global rules-based order.\n\nZelensky told Marcos Jnr after their brief meeting: “Thank you so much, Mr President. We’re happy to be first time in the Philippines. I’m sure not the last,” according to an official palace news release.\n\n“Thank you for this invitation, and we’re very thankful to be in here in your country, and, which supports Ukraine, our territorial integrity and sovereignty. Thank you so much for your ‘big word’ and clear position about us, about this Russia occupation of our territories, and thank you on your support,” Zelensky was quoted as saying.\n\nIn turn, the palace said Marcos Jnr told the Ukrainian president it was “very good news” that the latter’s country would soon be opening an embassy in Manila this year “because we would very much like to continue to help, in any way that the Philippines can, through multilateral [efforts] and the UN”.\n\nThe Philippine leader pledged to “do all we can to promote peace and to bring an end to the fighting”, referencing Ukraine’s war with Russia.\n\n“It will be a difficult road to find our way back to a situation that is morally acceptable not only to Ukraine, but to the rest of the world,” Marcos Jnr noted.\n\nThe palace news release also stated: “President Marcos shared that the Philippines has been trying to promote the continuing adherence to international rules-based order as he reiterated the country’s efforts to advocate for peace and do everything it can to promote that peace.”\n\nThis was an oblique reference to Marcos Jnr’s repeated assertion that China should adhere to the “international rules-based order”, especially in an ongoing territorial dispute in the South China Sea.\n\nA 2016 arbitral ruling by an international tribunal, which was later dismissed by Beijing, stated that China’s nine-dash line was without basis under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The nine-dash line had enclosed both the Ayungin and Scarborough shoals – the main flashpoints between both sides – as within Chinese maritime territory.\n\nRetired Supreme Court associate justice Antonio Carpio told This Week in Asia he was “not surprised” by Zelensky’s sudden visit, adding this “shows how strategic the Ukrainians see the conflict”.\n\nExplaining why the visit was in the national interest of Manila, he said: “In Europe, Russia is trying to overturn the foundational UN Charter principle that all disputes between states must be settled peacefully, outlawing the use of force or the threat of force to settle such disputes.\n\n“In Europe, Russia is overturning this principle by invading and annexing a part of Ukraine to settle a territorial dispute. In the South China Sea, China is using threat of force to settle territorial and maritime disputes with China’s neighbours.”\n\nCarpio, who has made the South China Sea dispute a personal advocacy, said “both Russia and China are trying to overturn the foundational principle of the UN Charter that ‘Right is Might’”, a concept that he claimed “led to two world wars”.\n\nThere had been speculation the Ukrainian leader would visit Manila the night before he landed but the palace did not confirm this. Zelensky had come from the Shangri-La Dialogue security forum in Singapore, where he had called on Asian countries to join a June 15 peace summit in Switzerland.\n\nZelensky, wearing his signature casual black shirt with Ukrainian symbol, khaki cargo pants and rubber shoes – attire that would have been banned in Malacanang – was accorded an honour guard.\n\nA small contingent of high government officials – clad in semi-formal wear and led by Marcos Jnr, followed by his cousin House Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez and foreign secretary Enrique Manalo – greeted Zelensky inside.\n\nAt a press briefing on the sidelines of the Singapore forum, Zelensky had also accused China of pressuring other countries to boycott the Switzerland peace summit. Beijing has not responded to this salvo.\n\nZelensky said he had anticipated talking to Marcos Jnr on the sidelines of the forum but the Philippine leader had left shortly after giving a keynote speech on Friday night, so he had taken up Manila’s invitation to visit the palace.\n\nMonday’s meeting marked the second time both leaders discussed the Ukrainian crisis. On February 1 last year, Marcos Jnr posted on social media platform “X” that he and Zelensky had a phone conversation in which the latter thanked him “for supporting [the] sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine”.\n\nIn May last year, during the Centre for Strategic and International Studies Asean Leadership Forum in Washington, Marcos Jnr said: “The Philippines has been very clear in our support for the resolutions in the United Nations that were passed upon the onset of the war in Ukraine. And that we respect the sovereignty and territoriality of every single nation in the world.”\n\nHe called Ukraine’s situation “incredibly critical” and said Asean member states “are in full agreement” over the need to protect the sovereign rights of each nation, calling the situation in Ukraine “something that is really anachronistic in the modern world”.\n\nThe Philippine president’s remarks over the past year contrast starkly with his on-the-fence stance when he was running for the presidency. In March 2022, he had declared during a forum that the Philippines should side with no one in the war between Ukraine and Russia.\n\n“I don’t think there’s a need to take a stand. We are not involved except for our nationals,” he had said then, noting that Manila’s main concern was how to repatriate its nationals living in Ukraine.",

At the same time, the stabilizing presence of America is crucial to regional peace. It's never a choice. Both countries are important,'' Marcos said. -- with GMA Integrated News/KBK, GMA Integrated News",

        "title": "Japan must tread carefully amid South China Sea tensions, say experts",
        "body": "As Japan seeks to boost defense cooperation with the Philippines amid a Manila-Beijing territorial row that has escalated tensions in the South China Sea, experts are counseling Tokyo to take a cautious approach as the region balances the competing agendas of China and the United States.\n\nThe recent intensification of hostility between the Philippines and China in the disputed waters was highlighted at this year's Asia Security Summit, where Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. rapped Beijing for its \"illegal, coercive actions\" and argued strongly for the protection of the rules-based order in his speech.\n\nJapan has joined U.S.-led efforts to bolster defense ties with the Philippines, in a move seen as pushing back against China's ambitions in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nBeijing claims almost the entire area of the resource-rich South China Sea and has ongoing territorial rows with fellow littoral states, including Vietnam and Malaysia.\n\nManila asserts its sovereign rights in the South China Sea, and it started to call parts of the sea within the country's exclusive economic zone \"the West Philippine Sea\" in 2012.\n\nTokyo's pursuit of greater security cooperation with Manila and other regional countries is welcome as Southeast Asian nations need partner diversity, not just aligning with either the United States or China, said Evan Laksmana, senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, the host of the Singapore gathering.\n\nTokyo has taken part in joint maritime exercises with the Philippines, the United States and Australia in the South China Sea. In April, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida held the first-ever trilateral summit with Marcos and U.S. President Joe Biden in Washington.\n\nIn July, Japan and the Philippines will likely sign an agreement allowing their defense forces to train in each other's territories during a meeting involving the two nations' foreign and defense ministers, according to Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro.\n\nIn addition to Japan, other alternative security partners for the region include South Korea, Australia, France and Britain.\n\nBut Japan is unique because it has a \"strategic capital\" built around pragmatic cooperation and economic engagement over decades in Southeast Asia, the International Institute for Strategic Studies' Laksmana pointed out.\n\nHe warned some of that strategic capital can be eroded if Japan is \"seen as just an extension of the United States\" and \"overtly playing geopolitical cards\" when the region is very sensitive about polarizing moves.\n\n\"Japan has a great potential because of its long strategic capital, but if it does not play its cards right, I think it could be seen as Japan engaging in security cooperation with Southeast Asian countries as part of its competition against China,\" Laksmana said.\n\n\"If that is perceived as a problem, then I think it may not be successful,\" he added.\n\nChina has huge economic clout in the region and the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations maintains the principle of neutrality toward major powers, refraining from taking sides amid the intensifying rivalry between Beijing and Washington.\n\nSome ASEAN countries like Cambodia and Laos, this year's chair, are seen as pro-Beijing. Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei also have territorial disputes with China, but tensions are less intense compared with Manila's.\n\nMarcos' controversial predecessor Rodrigo Duterte appeased China and did not take a clear stance in opposition to its territorial advances in the South China Sea.\n\nASEAN and China have long been drafting a code of conduct to prevent confrontations in the South China Sea, but negotiations have stalled due partly to distrust generated by Beijing's harassment of other claimant states, said Tomotaka Shoji, director of the Regional Studies Department at the National Institute for Defense Studies.\n\nShoji said the Philippines under Marcos's leadership has sought alternative measures to ASEAN's approach amid a lack of progress on the code of conduct negotiations, namely aligning with the United States and its allies to keep China in check.\n\nSaya Kiba, associate professor at Kobe City University of Foreign Studies, indicated the Marcos government's \"transparency initiative\" to expose China's harassment toward Philippine vessels in the South China Sea has succeeded in gaining more international support for Manila's position.\n\nThe initiative launched last year allows journalists to board Philippine vessels and report pictures and videos of incidents.\n\nSince the policy started, more than a dozen European countries have expressed their support, despite their geographical distance, for a 2016 ruling of the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague that invalidated China's sweeping claims in the South China Sea, she said.\n\nBeijing has rejected the court's decision and continued its military buildup in the area.\n\nKiba said Japan can help the Philippines enhance its maritime security capabilities through the provision of additional patrol ships and surveillance technology. It can also back Manila's transparency strategy to gain more support for its sovereignty in line with the 2016 ruling.\n\nHowever, she said Manila \"does not want to be seen as clinging to the United States\" in the same way as other ASEAN member states that do not take sides with Beijing or Washington are viewed.\n\nIn his keynote speech at the conference known as the Shangri-La Dialogue, Marcos said both China and the United States are important in the region, referring to Beijing's \"determining influence\" over its economic evolution and \"the stabilizing presence of America\" that is \"crucial to regional peace.\"\n\nAlthough moves by the United States and Japan to deepen security cooperation with the Philippines have triggered speculation that they may seek Manila's support in the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, the Southeast Asian country has refrained from making mention of its stance in such a contingency, she said.\n\n\"The Philippines upholds the one-China principle and the general public does not support their country being dragged\" into a Taiwan emergency, Kiba said.\n\nMarcos said the Filipino people have \"a long history of fraternal bonds with the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait\" and urged \"all parties to exercise restraint on the issue.\"\n\nShoji also said when Japan joins efforts to counter China's maritime assertiveness in the South China Sea, it should be careful not to \"give China a reason to take a bold action\" in the East China Sea, where Beijing regularly sends vessels near the Tokyo-controlled Senkaku Islands to press its territorial claim.\n\nFor instance, Beijing reportedly regarded Tokyo's participation in the U.S. freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea as a \"red line\" that must not be crossed, he said. Japan has not joined those operations to avoid friction with neighboring countries.\n\n\"Japan should pay attention to the situations both in the South and East China seas to strike a balance and craft its strategies,\" Shoji said.",

        "summary": "Japan is advised to proceed cautiously as it seeks to enhance defense cooperation with the Philippines amid rising tensions in the South China Sea, where Manila and Beijing are embroiled in a territorial dispute. Experts emphasize the need for Japan to balance its actions to avoid being perceived as merely an extension of U.S. geopolitical strategies, which could erode its longstanding strategic capital in Southeast Asia.\n\nKey points include:\n- Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. criticized China's \"illegal, coercive actions\" at the Asia Security Summit, advocating for a rules-based order.\n- Japan is aligning with U.S. efforts to strengthen defense ties with the Philippines, participating in joint maritime exercises and planning a defense training agreement.\n- Experts like Evan Laksmana and Tomotaka Shoji caution Japan to avoid actions that could provoke China or polarize the region, which values neutrality.\n- The Philippines, under Marcos, is seeking international support against China's claims, using transparency initiatives to expose Chinese harassment.\n- Japan's potential contributions include providing patrol ships and surveillance technology to the Philippines.\n- The Philippines maintains a delicate stance, valuing both U.S. and Chinese roles in the region and avoiding explicit positions on potential conflicts like a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.\n\nThe overall implication is that Japan must carefully navigate its involvement to support regional stability without exacerbating tensions or undermining its strategic relationships."

Australia has requested to resume defense talks with China to the level of annual meetings between their defense chiefs and secretaries, following recent unsafe encounters with China's military. Concurrently, Australia is deepening its strategic relationship with the Philippines, highlighted by a significant joint amphibious exercise at Palawan island. Marles discussed these issues with Chinese defense chief Dong Jun and Philippines Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro, emphasizing the growing importance of these relationships amid regional tensions in the South China Sea."

        "body": "The United States and other nations could take steps against Chinese firms and financial institutions over Beijing's backing for the Russian war against Ukraine, a top U.S. official said.\n\nThe Biden administration has stepped up warnings about China's backing for Moscow and issued an executive order in December that threatened punitive measures against financial institutions helping Russia skirt Western sanctions.\n\n\"I think where we are primarily focused are on Chinese companies that have been involved in a systematic way in supporting Russia,\" U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell told reporters near the Virginia town of Washington when asked if the Chinese leadership and banks could be targeted.\n\n\"We've also looked closely at financial institutions.\"\n\nThe State Department's second-ranked official spoke at the start of a meeting with the vice foreign ministers of Japan and South Korea, Masataka Okano and Kim Hyong Kyun. The three allies have stepped up cooperation in the face of shared concerns about China, North Korea and Russian's war in Ukraine.\n\nEarlier this week Campbell said there was an urgent need for European and NATO countries to send a collective message of concern to China.\n\n\"There will be steps that are taken, not just by the United States, but other countries, signaling our profound displeasure about what China is seeking to do in its relationship with Russia on the battlefield in Ukraine,\" he said on Friday.\n\nCampbell met China's Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu on Thursday and raised U.S. concerns about Beijing's support to Russia's defense industrial base undermining European security, the State Department said.\n\nCampbell said his talks with his South Korea and Japanese counterparts would prepare the way for a trilateral leaders' summit later this year. He said the date wasn't yet set, but the meeting was of the \"highest priority.\"\n\nIn a joint statement from Friday's meeting, the allies reaffirmed their commitment to use their \"collective capacity to strengthen security and maintain peace and stability across the Indo-Pacific.\"\n\nThey pledged to continue working closely to boost economic security, including through Minerals Security Partnership projects, which are aimed at lessening reliance on China and Russia for critical resources needed in high-tech applications.\n\nThe allies also committed to work \"ever more closely to support Ukraine's energy infrastructure, recovery, and efforts to hold Russia accountable for its actions,\" the statement said.\n\nCampbell welcomed \"renewed diplomacy\" between China, Japan and South Korea, after leaders from the three countries met on Monday for the first time in four years. The two U.S. allies had offered a \"very deep and sincere debrief\" on their three-way meeting with China, he said.\n\nHe also commended Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr for a speech he gave at the Shangri-La Dialogue defense summit in Singapore, where the Asian leader alluded to \"illegal, coercive and aggressive\" actions by China in the disputed South China Sea.\n\nCampbell praised the speech as strong and purposeful, but would not directly answer a reporter's question on whether any incident involving China's Coast Guard that resulted in a Philippines service member being killed would trigger Washington's mutual defense treaty with Manila, calling it \"hypothetical.\"\n\nEncounters between the Philippines and China in Asia's most contested waters have grown more tense and frequent in the past year as Beijing presses its claims to shoals in waters that Manila says are well within its exclusive economic zone.\n\n\"We fundamentally believe that the United States and the Philippines are moving towards a closer set of relations in which we will be able to deepen our security partnership,\" Campbell said.\n\nSource: Reuters (Reporting by David Brunnstrom, writing by David Ljunggren and Michael Martina; Editing by Doina Chiacu, Chizu Nomiyama and Cynthia Osterman)",

        "body": "China's Defense Minister Dong Jun warned over the weekend that Beijing's restraint in the South China Sea (SC) has limits, in a thinly veiled threat to the Philippines and United States over their presence in the disputed waters.\n\nSpeaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue conference in Singapore on Sunday, Dong referenced a \"certain country,\" encouraged by external powers, which had allegedly engaged in \"mediated provocations.\"\n\n\"China has maintained sufficient restraint in the face of rights infringements and provocation, but there are limits to this,\" Dong said.\n\nThe Chinese official's comments followed President Ferdinand Marcos Jr's denunciation of \"illegal, coercive, and aggressive actions\" in the South China Sea by China in the same defense forum in Singapore last Friday.\n\nMarcos warned that the death of any Filipino citizen at the hands of another country in the South China Sea would be \"very close\" to an act of war.\n\n\"What would happen if there was an incident that ended up killing a Filipino serviceman, be it a Coast Guard or in the military and part of the Navy. Well, that would be -- that would certainly increase the level of response and if by a willful act on a Filipino, not only a serviceman but even a Filipino citizen. If a Filipino citizen is killed by a willful act, that is I think a very, very close to what we define as an act of war and, therefore, we will respond accordingly,\" he said.\n\nMDT invocation\n\nMarcos made the response when asked what actions would prompt the Philippine government to invoke the decades-old Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT) with the United States. The treaty holds that both countries would come to the defense of each other in case of an attack by a third party.\n\nBeijing has frequently accused Washington of supporting Taipei and Manila in resisting its assertive actions in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea.\n\nLast month, the Pentagon deployed an intermediate-range missile system in the Philippines during the annual Balikatan military drills, which Beijing condemned as introducing \"huge risks of war into the region.\"\n\nChina asserts control over nearly all of the South China Sea, a vital route for over $3 trillion in annual ship-borne trade. This claim includes areas also claimed by the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei. In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled that China's claims had no legal basis.\n\nTaiwan issue\n\nIn response to Chinese actions in the region, Marcos has pursued closer relations with the United States.\n\nAlso on Sunday, Chinese state media reported that personnel on a Philippine ship aimed guns at China's Coast Guard in the SCS. Philippine officials have yet to respond to the claim at press time.\n\nCCTV maintained at least two individuals on the Philippine vessel near the shoal were seen carrying guns on deck, pointing them toward the CCG ship, according to China's CCTV news channel.\n\nAn accompanying 29-second video seemed to show a masked man briefly holding up a blurred black object resembling a rifle. CCTV claimed that the purported incident took place during a Philippine mission to deliver supplies to troops.\n\nGiven its position in the South China Sea and proximity to self-ruled Taiwan, which China claims as its own, Philippine support would be crucial for the United States in the event of any conflict.\n\nDong also reiterated that China is ready to \"forcefully\" stop Taiwan's independence moves but called for greater exchanges with the United States.\n\n\"We have always been open to exchanges and cooperation, but this requires both sides to meet each other halfway,\" Dong told the meeting where he met with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Friday.\n\n\"We believe that we need more exchanges precisely because there are differences between our two militaries.\"\n\nDong and Austin met for over an hour at the luxury hotel hosting the forum, which is attended by defense officials from around the world and in recent years has been seen as a barometer of US-China relations.\n\nAfter the meeting, Austin said that telephone conversations between US and Chinese military commanders would resume \"in the coming months\", while Beijing hailed the \"stabilising\" security relations between the countries.\n\nThis year's Shangri-La Dialogue comes a week after China held military drills around self-ruled Taiwan and warned of war over the US-backed island following the inauguration of President Lai Ching-te, who Beijing has described as a \"dangerous separatist\".\n\n\"The Chinese People's Liberation Army has always been an indestructible and powerful force in defence of the unification of the motherland, and it will act resolutely and forcefully at all times to curb the independence of Taiwan and to ensure that it never succeeds in its attempts,\" Dong told the forum on Sunday.\n\n\"Whoever dares to split Taiwan from China will be crushed to pieces and suffer his own destruction.\"\n\nOn the South China Sea, which China claims almost entirely and where it has been involved in confrontations with Philippine vessels, Dong warned of \"limits\" to Beijing's restraint.\n\n\"China has maintained sufficient restraint in the face of rights infringements and provocation, but there are limits to this,\" Dong said.\n\nFlashpoint disputes\n\nPresident Joe Biden's administration and China have been stepping up communication to ease friction between the nuclear-armed rivals, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken visiting Beijing and Shanghai last month.\n\nA key focus has been the resumption of military-to-military dialogue, which is seen as critical to preventing flashpoint disputes from spinning out of control.\n\nChina scrapped military communications with the United States in 2022 in response to then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.\n\nTensions between Washington and Beijing were further stoked by issues including an alleged Chinese spy balloon that was shot down over US airspace, a meeting between Taiwan's then-president Tsai Ing-wen and Pelosi's successor Kevin McCarthy and American military aid for Taipei.\n\nChina is also furious over the United States' deepening defence ties in the Asia-Pacific, particularly with the Philippines, and its regular deployment of warships and fighter jets in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea.\n\nBeijing views this as part of a decades-long US effort to contain it.\n\nThe two sides agreed after a summit between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Biden last November to restart high-level military talks, including over military operations near Taiwan, Japan and in the South China Sea.",

        "body": "Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) chief Admiral Ronnie Gil Gavan stressed that water cannons aboard maritime vessels must only be used to save lives as he urged other countries to stop using them to attack fellow coast guards.\n\nGavan touched on the use of water cannons during his speech in a recently concluded special session on Maritime Law Enforcement and Confidence Building at the 21st Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore.\n\n\"The use of water cannons against fellow coast guards, well obviously, it doesn't look good. There is this proportionality in the use of force vis-à-vis the political message it sends. So, we're not very comfortable with that, so I hope that stops,\" he said.\n\nWhile China Coast Guard officials were present in the session, Gavan did not particularly mention which Coast Guard units or from which countries have been using water cannons to attack PCG units.\n\nNonetheless, the Philippine government, through its Department of Foreign Affairs, had filed numerous official complaints against Beijing for its coast guard's use of water cannons and \"dangerous maneuvers\" against the PCG.\n\nThose protests centered on China Coast Guard actions against PCG vessels, particularly at Ayungin (Second Thomas) Shoal, where the ship BRP Sierra Madre was grounded as a Philippine military outpost.\n\n\"The PCG finds moral strength in following what several fora have found to be among the most legally compliant and humane rules on the use of force,\" Gavan said.\n\nHe stressed the PCG remains steadfastly professional, patient, and respectful and \"that its fitted water cannons, or more properly called fire monitors or ships, are not meant to light up the fire.\"\n\n\"They are there to save lives and property from fire or simply to put off fire. Never to hose down one to pieces to start a fire,\" he added. \"This is how we exist and intend to live our role for our country and the rest of the global users of the WPS/SCS.\"\n\nGavan pointed out that the international community recognized the challenges being faced by the Philippines over its territorial claims in the South China Sea.\n\n\"We just have to go back to the basics of humanity. If we embrace together what is right, we won't be wrong,\" he said.\n\nIn the same forum, Ge Henwen from Beijing said Chinese fishermen also experienced water cannon attacks from Japan, noting that they are not the first country to use such force.\n\n\"If I'm not wrong, the Japanese Coast Guard was the first one who use water cannons toward Chinese fishing boats and fishermen. Maybe everyone, you can find hundreds of pictures in the Internet from the 1990s to 2000s, 2010s,\" he said.\n\nThe Chinese official emphasized the need for dialogue in handling territorial disputes.\n\n\"It's better for us to sit down and talk and negotiate under the framework of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea instead of unilaterally sending military or semi-military personnel to intrude into the Rén'ài Jiāo,\" Ge said, referring to the increasing tension in the Ayungin Shoal.\n\nThe change in the Philippine government's foreign policy \"has resulted in the increase of tension in the region,\" he added.\n\nOn the other hand, Gavan said the United States and Japan have expressed willingness to conduct joint maritime sails with the Philippines.\n\n\"Even without these developments, the United States Coast Guard and Japan Coast Guard have been in talks with us on how they can help us better perform our role. I think talks are underway on how we can do things better,\" he said.",

        "summary": "Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) chief Admiral Ronnie Gil Gavan emphasized that water cannons on maritime vessels should only be used for saving lives, not for attacking other coast guards. Speaking at the 21st Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, Gavan criticized the use of water cannons against fellow coast guards, highlighting the disproportionate use of force and its negative political implications. Although he did not specify which countries were involved, the Philippines has filed numerous complaints against China for its coast guard's aggressive actions, particularly at Ayungin Shoal.\n\nGavan reiterated that the PCG adheres to humane and legally compliant rules on the use of force, using water cannons solely for firefighting and rescue purposes. He called for a return to basic human values and international cooperation to resolve territorial disputes. Chinese official Ge Henwen, also present at the forum, noted that Chinese fishermen have faced similar attacks from Japan and advocated for dialogue under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\n\nGavan mentioned that the United States and Japan are willing to conduct joint maritime operations with the Philippines, indicating ongoing discussions to enhance cooperation."

        "title": "Vietnam and Cambodia Clash Over New Mekong Canal",
        "body": "In August 2023, Cambodia sent an official notice to the Mekong River Commission flagging the construction of a new major canal project on the Mekong River. The Mekong, long a source of regional bounty, has become a modern point of contention for the countries along the waterway, with disputes over the environmental and economic cost to the river flow from the growing number of upstream dam and canal projects.\n\nCambodia's planned 180-kilometre Funan Techo Canal, worth US$1.7 billion, is funded by China as a part of the Belt and Road Initiative. This canal provides a waterway linking the capital Phnom Penh and the deep seaport in the coastal province Kep, ultimately opening onto the South China Sea. The Cambodian government hopes that this ambitious project may foster economic development by facilitating the transportation of goods and eco-tourism, along with an estimated 5 million jobs to be created. Moreover, the Funan Techo waterway would reduce Cambodia's dependence on Vietnam's seaport, notably Cai Mep.\n\nThe canal project may bring economic benefits to Cambodia, however, it has lead to mounting concerns within neighbouring Vietnam. Water security is a particular concern, with the canal is thought to act like a dam, altering the flow of the river and preventing water from reaching areas in the Mekong Delta in the south of Vietnam. This would not only exacerbate the present long-term drought and growing problems with salination affecting Vietnamese agriculture, but also impact the habitat of endangered species.\n\nThe project also brings geopolitical anxiety for Vietnam. The canal thought to have \"dual-use\" potential - that is, promoting economic growth and domestic connectivity for Cambodia, but it could also facilitate China's military presence in the country. The canal is said to connect the Ream naval base in Sihanoukville, recently refurbished with Chinese funding. A CNN report in December last year showed that two Chinese navy frigates docked at the base. Security concerns have been raised about the ability of vessels to transit the Funan Techo canal from the Gulf of Thailand.\n\nCambodian officials have defended the aims of the project. Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Manet claimed the canal would have minimal effects on Vietnam and that there would be no foreign military base on Cambodia's territory in line with Article 53 of its constitution. His father, and former Cambodian leader Hun Sen, declared the canal would not strain the Vietnam-Cambodia relationship. Meanwhile, the United States and Vietnam have called for more information and transparency about the canal.\n\nThe Funan Techo canal is a further example of Cambodia's economic reliance on China and Beijing's considerable economic influence in Southeast Asia. This concern is not only for Vietnam but extends to the unity and consensus of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. In 2012 and 2016, Cambodia blocked a ASEAN statement on the South China Sea dispute, which stymied Vietnam's effort to internationalise the issue and call for regional support.\n\nHanoi's influence in Phnom Penh has evidently decreased - a relationship that has a tumultuous history, with Vietnam having militarily intervened in Cambodia in 1978, maintained its influence in the country for a decade, and then significantly supported the Hun Sen's government. Anti-Vietnam sentiment in Cambodia runs deep, as the stage for the clash of ancient empires seeking dominance in Indochina, with the Nguyen dynasty's territory expansion southward over land regarded by Cambodians as \"Kampuchea Krom\", and illegal Vietnamese migrants in Cambodia.\n\nChina describes Cambodia as its \"ironclad\" friend in Southeast Asia. The Mekong is watery thread that these regional rivalries are seeking to bend in their favour.\n\nJuki Trinh is a PhD student at School of Political Science and International Studies, the University of Queensland. His research interests are Vietnam's foreign policy, regional order change in the Indo-Pacific, and security studies.",

        "body": "Click here to get Khmer Times Breaking News direct into your Telegram\n\nMinister of National Defence General Tea Seiha expressed concern that the Asia-Pacific region has entered an era of turmoil in international relations as the political environment has changed and become unpredictable.\n\nThe remarks were made when Gen Seiha addressed the International Institute for Strategic Studies' (IISS) Shangri-La Dialogue 2024, under the topic \"Building Cooperative Security in the Asia-Pacific\" in Singapore for three days from May 31 to Saturday.\n\nGen Seiha, who is also a Deputy Prime Minister, said, \"In the Asia-Pacific region, security is of mutual concern and has long-term consequences, these include increased security issues, climate change, water resources, food security, energy and infectious diseases, terrorism, and drug and human trafficking.\"\n\n\"There are also concerns related to many security threats such as escalating geopolitical competition, unresolved territorial disputes, the accelerating arms race, and uncontrolled spread of weapons technology,\" he said.\n\n\"Although there has been no direct military confrontation (between major powers), there is a risk of eventual conflict. In particular, many areas of confrontation have arisen that we may have not assessed correctly,\" he said.\n\nGen Seiha led a Cambodian delegation, comprising Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF) General Vong Pisen, General Nem Sowath, Director-General of the General Department of Policy and Foreign Affairs of the Ministry of National Defence, Lieutenant General Hun Manith, the head of the Ministry of National Defence's military intelligence unit, and deputy commander of the Royal Cambodian Army (RCA) and Lieutenant General Prak Sovanna, RCA Deputy Commander to participate in the defence summit.\n\nGen Seiha said building security cooperation is important for peace and stakeholders should strive to promote multilateral mechanisms through regional cooperation with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) at the core in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nStakeholders should use ASEAN strengths to attract countries to the bloc and related meetings to promote mutual trust and confidence, as well as regional solidarity and cooperation, he said.\n\nAs a member of ASEAN, Cambodia would like to see ASEAN members continue to support and adhere to ASEAN's centrality and unity. A breakup of ASEAN would have a negative impact not only on the bloc's member states, but also on other countries in the Asia-Pacific region, he said.\n\nIn a sideline meeting, Gen Seiha spoke with Singapore Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen, with both sides committed to working together for peace in ASEAN, with bilateral cooperation between the countries strengthening over the years.\n\nAccording to a statement from the Defence Ministry yesterday, Gen Seiha thanked the Singapore's Defence Minister for providing an opportunity for the Cambodian Defence Ministry delegation to participate in the defence summit.\n\nCooperation between Cambodia and Singapore has moved forward strongly over the years, and Gen Seiha expects bilateral ties to continue to grow with the aim of jointly maintaining regional peace.\n\nThe IISS first convened the Shangri-La Dialogue, also known as the Asian Regional Security Summit, in 2002.\n\nIt is Asia's premier defence summit, bringing together defence ministers and senior officials, as well as business leaders and security experts from across the Asia-Pacific, Europe, North America and beyond, to discuss the region's pressing security challenges.\n\nThis year's summit will be the 21st edition, as it did not take place in 2020 or 2021 owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

        "title": "Learning from OFAC sanctions violations",
        "body": "A RECENT Deloitte report analyzing sanction violation settlements issued by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), a branch of the US Department of the Treasury, presents a sobering picture for companies based in the Philippines, especially considering the magnitude of the potential financial penalties. Just within the period of the analysis (between January 2022 and April 2024), 34 settlements with the OFAC amounted to over $1.6 billion in financial penalties. This figure only scratches the surface, as it does not encompass the additional costs of organizational disruption or reputational damage.\n\nImpact on Philippine businesses\n\nDespite being geographically distant from the US, Philippine companies are not immune to the need to comply with sanction requirements. Given the OFAC's global reach, companies in the Philippines shoulder a legal and regulatory obligation to implement robust controls to ensure compliance. This means they must have mechanisms in place to ensure they avoid any transactions with individuals, companies, or countries that appear on the OFAC's various sanctions lists. This includes buying or selling products, providing or receiving services, and transferring or receiving funds to or from sanctioned parties.\n\nIt's a complex situation, and remaining compliant is no small feat -- particularly given the current global geopolitical environment where requirements change rapidly, with new sanctions often being imposed with immediate effect. Compounding these challenges is the criminal intent of those seeking to evade sanctions, routinely deploying deceptive tactics to conceal their identities and masking the true beneficiary or purpose of their transactions.\n\nRegional tensions and geopolitical events can often trigger a cascade of new sanctions -- a scenario that we've seen recently because of the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine. Closer to home, the rising tension in the Taiwan Strait and the ongoing territorial dispute in the South China Sea involving China and several other claimant countries, including the Philippines, adds another layer of sanction risk, which could have significant ramifications for Philippine companies. As the US continues to demonstrate its support for its allies like the Philippines and Taiwan, the extension of US sanctions against Chinese interests is a real possibility in the event the dispute escalates further.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nFor the Philippines, any such extension could have important implications.\n\nThe economic interplay\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe economic relationship and supply chain between China and the Philippines are deeply intertwined, spanning various sectors such as manufacturing, infrastructure, real estate, energy, and technology. Philippine companies rely heavily on Chinese suppliers for raw materials, critical components, and intermediate goods essential for their operations. Conversely, Chinese companies view the Philippines as a strategic partner, sourcing resources and finished products to fuel their own economy.\n\nChina's investment in the Philippines has also been substantial, with significant capital flowing into sectors including infrastructure, manufacturing, real estate, energy and technology.\n\nThe challenges\n\nThe potential imposition of more US sanctions on Chinese interests is likely to be a concern for any business operating in the Philippines. Sanctions can often be imposed with immediate effect, leaving businesses no time to respond effectively, resulting in significant difficulties when seeking to remain compliant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis creates a number of potential issues:\n\n- Significant supply chain disruption. Given the deep integration of Chinese suppliers in the supply chains of many Philippine industries, sanctions could lead to sudden disruptions. Companies may find themselves unable to procure critical components or materials, jeopardizing production and operations.\n\n- Financial repercussions. In the event of non-compliance, access could be restricted to financing from US institutions or any entity that adheres to US sanctions regulations. This could lead to liquidity issues, increased borrowing costs and challenges in maintaining financial stability.\n\n- Legal and compliance risks. As the Deloitte report shows, non-compliance with OFAC sanctions requirements can result in severe penalties, including hefty fines and loss of access to the US financial system. This necessitates stringent compliance measures to avoid inadvertent violations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSensible steps that can be taken now:\n\n- Perform a comprehensive preemptive sanction risk assessment. First and foremost, companies in the Philippines should assess sanction risk now so that they can respond more effectively in the event that US sanctions against Chinese interests are extended in the future. Preparing in advance can prevent companies from being caught off guard. This could mean assessing what industries and goods are most likely to be impacted and identifying alternative suppliers. It would also be prudent to anticipate potential import/export restrictions, which is another tool being increasingly utilized by US authorities.\n\n- Prioritize and tailor your compliance program. Our analysis found that in 88 percent of cases, when determining the financial penalty, the OFAC considered a robust compliance program tailored to the organization's size and complexity a significant mitigating factor. A comprehensive compliance program can help manage the risk of sanctions violations and, in the event of a breach, could be taken into consideration when determining any settlement.\n\n- Provide comprehensive and regular training. Compliance training programs should not be seen as a one-time event but as an ongoing process that evolves alongside regulatory changes, emerging risks and organizational requirements. Regular training sessions, tailored to employees' roles, can help foster a culture of accountability and awareness, reducing the likelihood of sanctions violations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConclusion\n\nIn a world where we have seen geopolitical tensions result in new sanctions being rapidly introduced, staying ahead of the curve is not just a strategic advantage -- it's a necessity.\n\nHopefully, the dispute in the South China Sea won't deteriorate further. But if it does, and US sanctions against Chinese interests are extended, it could create a complex puzzle for companies in the Philippines to solve, and hence, it would be prudent to consider this scenario in advance.\n\nAs the old adage goes, \"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\" Thinking about the risks now, rather than waiting for potential sanctions to be imposed, can help companies in the Philippines manage their risk more effectively and increase the chance of remaining compliant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo access Deloitte Philippines' report, \"Paying the price: Why violating OFAC sanctions can be a costly lesson for global businesses,\" please visit this link: https://www2.deloitte.com/ph/en/pages/financial-advisory/articles/ofac-sanctions-costly-lesson.html.\n\nThe author is the managing director of Deloitte Forensic at Deloitte Philippines, a member of the Deloitte Asia Pacific Network.

The Philippines can tap investment opportunities particularly in industrial parks and nickel.\n\nProperty developers can put up industrial parks using foreign capital while mining firms could cash in on growing global demand for electric vehicle batteries relying heavily on nickel.",

There have also been collisions that injured several Filipino troops.\n\nManila and Beijing have a long history of maritime territorial disputes, but tensions have worsened under Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos.\n\nChina claims almost the entire South China Sea, brushing off rival claims from other countries, including the Philippines, and ignoring an international ruling that its claims have no legal basis.\n\nMarcos has sought closer ties with the United States as he stands up to Chinese actions in the waterway.\n\nIn remarks to the security forum on Friday, Marcos said the Philippines would not give in to Chinese pressure.\n\n\"Illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive actions continue to violate our sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdictions,\" Marcos said.\n\n\"I do not intend to yield,\" he said. \"Filipinos do not yield.\"\n\nPointing guns\n\nIn Beijing, Chinese state media said on Sunday that personnel on a Philippine ship pointed guns at China's Coast Guard in disputed waters of the South China Sea last month.\n\nAt least two personnel on the Philippine vessel near the shoal were carrying guns on deck, pointing them in the direction of China's Coast Guard, CCTV said in a social media post.\n\nAn accompanying 29-second video appeared to show a masked man momentarily holding up a blurred black object that resembled a rifle.\n\nMore than $3 trillion of annual ship-borne commerce passes through the South China Sea, claimed in parts by the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei. The Permanent Court of Arbitration in 2016 said China's practically wholesale claims had no legal basis.\n\nCCTV said the alleged incident occurred during a Philippine mission to supply troops.",

The Philippines, a key U.S. ally, has faced increased harassment from the China Coast Guard, including water cannon attacks and collisions. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos has vowed not to yield to Chinese pressure, emphasizing the country's sovereignty. The U.S. recently deployed a missile system in the northern Philippines for joint exercises, which China claims damages regional security. Additionally, Chinese state media reported that Philippine personnel pointed guns at China's Coast Guard in disputed waters, further escalating tensions. The South China Sea is a critical maritime route, with multiple countries, including the Philippines, contesting China's extensive territorial claims, which an international court has ruled have no legal basis."

Xu's comments were compared to those of Wang Jingwei, a historical figure known for his collaboration with Japanese invaders.\n\nXu's misattribution involved a distorted version of Biden's actual statement, which expressed unwavering U.S. support for Ukraine against Russian aggression. The controversy intensified as Chinese netizens and media criticized Xu, accusing him of promoting surrender and misrepresenting facts.\n\nAdditionally, during the Shangri-La Dialogue, Xu clashed with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. over the South China Sea issue, reflecting China's contentious stance in the region. The incident highlighted ongoing tensions and the aggressive diplomatic posture of Chinese officials."

        "body": "（中央社記者周慧盈北京4日電）中國與菲律賓近幾個月來在南海衝突不斷，近日又傳出菲國艦上士兵稍早時槍指中國海警的說法。中國外交部今天回應媒體時要求菲國不要製造事端。\n\n中國官媒央視近日曝光一段影片顯示，菲律賓5月19日對擱淺在仁愛暗沙的「馬德雷山號」軍艦進行空投補給，而「中國海警依法依規應對」時，發現菲國艦上至少兩名人員持槍在甲板活動，並用手、用槍指著中國海警方向。\n\n綜合陸媒報導，有外媒下午在中國外交部例行記者會追問此事，包括「菲律賓人員是否真的用槍指著中國海警？中國政府對這種具體行為有何評論？」\n\n中國外交部發言人毛寧回答時表示，「在仁愛礁（仁愛暗沙）問題上，菲方是不斷侵權挑釁、激化矛盾的一方，我們要求菲方不要背信棄義，不要製造事端」。\n\n她並說，菲律賓派軍艦在仁愛礁「坐灘」這個行為本身就是非法的，菲方還一再挑釁、激化矛盾、升級事態，這是中國不能接受的。\n\n對於如何處理這個問題，毛寧指出，中方已經反覆闡明原則立場，「我們希望菲方不要再繼續製造事端，而是要回到通過對話協商解決分歧的正確軌道上來」。\n\n外電報導，對於「菲律賓士兵用槍指著中國海警船」的指控，菲律賓軍方今天說，中國海警船非常接近該船時，菲律賓士兵握緊武器，但沒有用槍指著中國海警船。\n\n菲律賓武裝部隊發言人巴迪亞（Francel Margareth Padilla）表示，菲律賓軍隊遵守交戰規則，並保持最高水準的職業操守。\n\n中菲之間近幾個月來持續在南海爭議水域爆發海上衝突，包括中國以高壓水炮造成菲國人員受傷和船隻損失、以軍用級雷射照射菲律賓船隻以及在爭議水道「危險駕駛」等，導致南海緊張局勢升溫。\n\n菲律賓1999年刻意將登陸艦馬德雷山號（Sierra Madre）擱淺在仁愛暗沙（Second Thomas Shoal），至今未拖離，且派遣軍隊駐防，以此強化對南沙群島主權的主張。中國政府則強調仁愛礁（仁愛暗沙）是中國南沙群島的一部分，持續要求菲方拖走非法「坐灘」的軍艦。（編輯：謝怡璇）1130604",

        "summary": "In recent months, tensions between China and the Philippines have escalated in the South China Sea. A recent incident involved Filipino soldiers allegedly pointing guns at Chinese coast guards. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has urged the Philippines to avoid creating further conflicts. Chinese state media released a video showing Filipino personnel on the Sierra Madre ship, grounded at Second Thomas Shoal, pointing guns towards Chinese coast guards during a resupply mission on May 19. \n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning accused the Philippines of illegal actions and provocations at the shoal, demanding they cease such activities and return to dialogue-based conflict resolution. The Philippines' military denied the accusation, stating their soldiers only held their weapons without pointing them at the Chinese.\n\nThis incident is part of ongoing maritime disputes, including previous confrontations where China used water cannons and military-grade lasers against Filipino vessels. The Philippines grounded the Sierra Madre at the shoal in 1999 to assert its territorial claims, which China disputes, insisting the area is part of its territory."

        "body": "泽连斯基的亚洲之行可以说是毫无征兆，在出席过新加坡香格里拉对话会后，他又虚晃一枪，跑到菲律宾会见马科斯。\n\n据环球网报道，3日乌克兰总统泽连斯基突然到访马尼拉并与菲律宾总统马科斯举行会谈。菲总统府新闻稿称，泽连斯基仅在马尼拉停留一天后就匆匆离开，期间他与马科斯讨论了两国\"共同关心的问题\"。\n\n菲总统府新闻稿对这场堪称\"秘密\"会晤的表述非常官方：泽连斯基向马科斯支持乌克兰领土完整的立场表示感谢，并邀请其出席即将在瑞士举行的乌克兰和平峰会。\n\n对此，马科斯的回应也大打官腔，称菲律宾将会\"尽一切努力\"和\"任何可能的形式\"帮助乌克兰，\"要促成不仅对乌克兰，而且对世界其他地区来说，在道德上都可以接受的局面\"。\n\n表面上，泽连斯基与马科斯上述交谈的内容非常官方正式，看起来没有太多值得关注的信息，然而这只是菲官方新闻稿单方面描述，如果翻看菲律宾媒体的报道，就会发现这场会晤实际上充满了针对中国的\"火药味\"。\n\n根据菲媒\"拉普勒新闻\"网的说法，泽连斯基在会谈中多次\"打擦边球\"，拿乌克兰当前的局势暗示\"这与菲律宾在南海面临的挑战有诸多相似之处\"，并鼓吹称如果俄罗斯占领乌克兰，那么\"类似的战争将会发生在菲律宾身上\"，但\"如果乌克兰能保持强势，这将向其他国家发出信号，即不要试图入侵另一个国家\"。\n\n必须要承认，泽连斯基确实非常懂得\"说话的艺术\"，他的这些言论并不新鲜，完全是在复读岸田文雄那套\"今日乌克兰就是明日东亚\"的谬论，也就是借着中俄友好关系，以及中国在俄乌冲突中不站队的立场搞政治影射，只不过泽连斯基嘴里的\"亚洲乌克兰\"这次换成菲律宾罢了。\n\n但讽刺的是，就连菲律宾媒体都意识到泽连斯基言论的危险性，并指责他\"把话题扯远\"时，马科斯却不仅表现出一副没听懂其中话外音的姿态，并且还附和起泽连斯基的论调，称菲律宾\"始终致力于遵守基于规则的国际秩序\"。\n\n马科斯的场面话说得倒是好听，但所谓的\"遵守基于规则的国际秩序\"，说白了就是菲律宾要继续充当维护美国霸权的马前卒、破坏南海的和平稳定。\n\n故而马科斯对泽连斯基言论的附和，也引起了菲律宾国内担忧。3日菲左翼政治组织\"新爱国联盟\"要求马科斯解释他对泽连斯基的表态，并警告菲律宾绝对不能成为\"第二个乌克兰\"，美国挑起的战争风险和紧张局势不符合菲律宾的国家利益。\n\n\"新爱国联盟\"这份声明写得非常直白，甚至可以说就是指着马科斯的鼻子\"骂\"他是亲美派和亚洲版\"泽连斯基\"：菲律宾明明有办法解决与中国的南海争端，但马科斯偏偏选择了最危险的方式，试图让菲律宾成为美国代理人战争的前哨。\n\n但菲律宾政党的警告会让马科斯清醒过来吗？\n\n显然不可能。马科斯对泽连斯基那番揣着明白装糊涂的附和，充分证明了他打算沿着\"倚美抗华\"的邪路走到黑，这就更不用说马科斯的家族资产几乎全在美国掌控之中，对于像他这样的\"买办\"政客而言，一个被砸烂的菲律宾显然不如保全自己的家族财富重要。\n\n所以，指望马科斯能幡然醒悟，还不如观察杜特尔特什么时候会被他\"逼反\"。",

        "summary": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's unexpected visit to Manila on June 3, where he met with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., has sparked significant controversy. The official statement from the Philippine presidential office described the meeting as a discussion on \"mutual concerns,\" with Zelensky thanking Marcos for supporting Ukraine's territorial integrity and inviting him to a peace summit in Switzerland. However, Philippine media reports suggest the meeting had a strong anti-China undertone, with Zelensky drawing parallels between Ukraine's situation and the South China Sea disputes faced by the Philippines. He implied that a strong Ukraine would deter similar conflicts elsewhere.\n\nMarcos's response, which aligned with Zelensky's rhetoric, has raised concerns domestically. The leftist political group \"New Patriotic Alliance\" criticized Marcos, warning against the Philippines becoming a \"second Ukraine\" and accusing him of aligning too closely with U.S. interests, potentially destabilizing the region. The group's statement highlighted fears that Marcos's stance could lead the Philippines into unnecessary conflict, prioritizing U.S. interests over national stability. Despite these warnings, it appears unlikely that Marcos will change his pro-U.S. stance, given his family's significant assets in the United States."

        "body": "5月31日至6月2日，第21届香格里拉对话会（以下简称\"香会\"）在新加坡召开。本届香会汇聚了40余名各国部长级官员，共计570余名代表参会。中美关系、台湾问题、南海问题、俄乌冲突和巴以冲突成为热议的焦点问题。笔者亲临现场，近距离观察场内的激烈交锋。\n\n当地时间2024年5月31日，为期三天的香格里拉对话会在新加坡香格里拉酒店开幕。视觉中国 图\n\n中美战略竞争几乎是探讨一切地区安全问题的\"背景板\"。一些主办方和媒体人士表示，相较于去年香会，美方此次在对华表态上明显降低了调门，这应该与两国防长在5月31日举行双边会晤、恢复了沟通有着密切联系。美国防长奥斯汀在主旨演讲中，对此次会晤给予了高度评价，指出双方进行了\"坦诚而深入的讨论\"，并强调为避免可能出现的误解和误判，确保双方沟通渠道畅通无阻尤为重要。31日下午，中国国防部新闻发言人吴谦召开新闻发布会，介绍会谈相关情况，也指出这是一次积极、务实、富有建设性的战略沟通。\n\n在中美战略竞争持续进行的态势下，东南亚国家面临着日益增大的选边压力。特别是在美国持续将各种议题安全化、政治化的背景下，东南亚国家所需权衡的因素及其影响日趋复杂。在香会上，多名东南亚国家的防长强调，希望中美双方能够谨慎处理竞争关系，并明确表达了东南亚国家不愿选边站队的立场。印尼防长、当选总统普拉博沃在主旨演讲中指出，中国文明与以美国为代表的西方文明均是人类文明的瑰宝，希望大国充分展现智慧与风范，秉持善意，推动国际合作，造福全人类。同时，他明确表示，印尼将继续坚持不结盟、不选边的外交政策，发扬睦邻友好的亚洲文化传统，与各国保持友好交往。马来西亚防长拿督斯里卡立诺丁指出，由\"志同道合国家\"组建排他性的安全合作机制，存在着进一步加剧分裂、危及地区稳定的潜在风险。作为东盟明年的轮值主席国，马来西亚将发挥引领作用，致力于维护东盟的中立立场，避免参与任何形式的选边站队。\n\n台湾问题作为本次香会备受瞩目的核心议题之一，在会议期间引发了广泛而深入的讨论。6月2日，中国国防部长董军发表了题为\"中国的全球安全观\"的主旨演讲，并在随后的互动环节中，着重阐述了中方在台湾问题上的坚定立场，彰显了中国坚决维护国家主权和领土完整的坚定信念与坚强决心。一些与会者表示，中方传递的信息清晰而明确，给人留下深刻印象。在大会后续环节，新加坡防长黄永宏指出，当前存在一种将台湾问题与俄乌冲突相混淆的错误倾向，然而必须明确的是，台湾并非乌克兰，中国亦非俄罗斯，并引用王毅外长在慕尼黑安全会议上的涉台问题立场表态，建议各方以此为参考准则，共同维护台海和平稳定。\n\n当地时间2024年5月31日，为期三天的香格里拉对话会在新加坡香格里拉酒店开幕。视觉中国 图\n\n在会议首日晚宴上，菲律宾总统小马科斯受邀发表主旨演讲，大谈南海问题，试图将南海问题扩大化，有意将香会的重点议题导向南海。据笔者参会期间的有限观察，至少有两次在不同会场中，听众向发言人提出了以下问题，即如果中菲海上相遇时，有菲律宾渔民或军人遭遇不幸，是否将触发《美菲共同防御条约》。此举显然旨在渲染海上事态的紧张氛围，并测试美菲双方的共同防御承诺。菲律宾总统小马科斯在经过短暂思考后表示，若菲国民之死亡系出于蓄意行为所致，则此等情形\"极其趋近于我们所界定的战争，相信我们的伙伴国亦会秉持相同的认知\"。\n\n次日，针对相似的问题，美国国防部长奥斯汀再次重申了对共同防御条约的坚定承诺，但他拒绝就假设性情境作出回应，并强调需竭力避免此类事件发生。美菲两国的不同态度，明显折射出菲律宾单方面对美方更积极承诺的渴求，以及急于将美国直接拉入相关事态中的迫切心态。然而，美方对此却持有一定的抗拒态度，意在避免直接牵涉其中。美菲各自打着自己的小算盘，显然利益诉求并不一致。\n\n在香会举行的公开及闭门会议中，澳大利亚、加拿大等美国盟伴国家对南海、\"航行自由\"话题也非常积极，并且在谈论所谓\"航行自由\"话题时渲染中国威胁论调，其积极程度甚至超越了提出这一概念的美国本身，借此从舆论上向中方发难。\n\n未得到充分关注的巴以问题\n\n乌克兰总统泽连斯基的现身又是本届香会的一个重要热点。5月31日晚，突然有消息称泽连斯基将出席香会。次日下午，泽连斯基抵达香格里拉酒店，立即成为各方瞩目的中心。6月2日中午，在马来西亚防长和新加坡防长发言及问答环节结束后，泽连斯基突然步入会场。在现场，尽管有一两位西方外貌的观众率先起立鼓掌，但并未引发广泛的效仿。紧接着，泽连斯基发表了演讲，其中着重强调了核安全、粮食安全以及人道主义\"三点和平方案\"，并宣传推广即将在瑞士举行的\"乌克兰和平峰会\"。\n\n在本次香会上，令人意外的是，巴以问题未能得到充分的关注与讨论。台下几乎没有人主动提出疑问，质疑为何停火迟迟未能实现。在所有嘉宾发言中，仅有印尼防长、当选总统普拉博沃的主旨演讲，以及马来西亚防长拿督斯里卡立诺丁的发言详细阐述了相关立场，较为引人注目。普拉博沃指出，两国方案是实现持久和平的关键途径，支持美国总统拜登提出的\"三步走\"方案的基本方向，并承诺愿意向联合国提供维和部队以助力和平进程。马来西亚防长对印尼方的立场表示赞同，要求以色列立即停止在拉法的军事行动，并呼吁下一届香会邀请巴勒斯坦代表参与。\n\n香会是西方智库在新加坡举办的国际安全会议，对他们来说属于\"主场外交\"，随着中国的崛起，部分国家一直希望将香会打造成一个围堵中国的平台。比如在2019年香会上，主办方在通往会场的通道上挂满了中国国内各地兵力部署图，具体到山东、福建、辽宁、上海、广东等等。当时中国代表团注意到这一现象后迅速和 \"香会\"主办方英国国际战略研究所(IISS)进行交涉，随后该兵力部署图被撤除。本届香会中，美国及其盟友依然沉迷于自我陈述，深陷于其构建的中国威胁论之中，所谓的对话实则已蜕变为美国盟伴国家共同构筑信息茧房的自我陶醉的盛宴。\n\n（作者系复旦大学国际问题研究院副研究员）",

Key topics included U.S.-China relations, the Taiwan issue, the South China Sea, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the Israel-Palestine conflict.\n\n**Main Points:**\n1. **U.S.-China Relations:** The dialogue saw a moderated tone from the U.S. towards China, likely influenced by a bilateral meeting between the U.S. and Chinese defense ministers on May 31. Both sides emphasized the importance of maintaining open communication channels to avoid misunderstandings.\n2. **Southeast Asia's Position:** Southeast Asian countries expressed their desire to avoid taking sides in the U.S.-China strategic competition. Indonesian Defense Minister and President-elect Prabowo emphasized non-alignment and regional cooperation, while Malaysia's Defense Minister highlighted the risks of exclusive security alliances.\n3. **Taiwan Issue:** Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun reiterated China's firm stance on Taiwan, emphasizing national sovereignty and territorial integrity. Singapore's Defense Minister Ng Eng Hen clarified that Taiwan should not be conflated with Ukraine.\n4. **South China Sea:** Philippine President Marcos Jr. sought to highlight the South China Sea issue, testing the U.S.-Philippines defense commitments. U.S. Defense Secretary Austin reaffirmed the defense treaty but avoided hypothetical scenarios.\n5. **Russia-Ukraine Conflict:** Ukrainian President Zelensky's unexpected appearance focused on nuclear safety, food security, and humanitarian issues, promoting an upcoming peace summit in Switzerland.\n6. **Israel-Palestine Conflict:** The issue received limited attention, with notable mentions from Indonesian and Malaysian defense ministers advocating for a two-state solution and calling for an end to Israeli military actions in Rafah.\n\n**Significant Outcomes:**\n- The dialogue underscored the ongoing strategic competition between the U.S. and China, with Southeast Asian nations striving to maintain neutrality.\n- The Taiwan issue remained a critical point of contention, with clear messages from China about its stance.\n- The South China Sea discussions highlighted differing expectations between the U.S. and the Philippines regarding defense commitments.\n- Zelensky's participation brought attention to the Ukraine conflict, though the Israel-Palestine issue was largely overlooked.\n\nThe event illustrated the Western focus on perceived threats from China, with the dialogue serving as a platform for reinforcing these narratives."

        "body": "中方忍耐已到极限，菲律宾自曝派往仁爱礁的船只遭到中国海警无差别拦截，补给也被全部倒入海里。中菲在仁爱礁又爆发了怎样的正面摩擦？中方的处置方式为何出现了明显变化？为什么说中方的忍耐已经到了极限？\n\n香格里拉对话会在新加坡落幕，作为亚太安全问题的主要议题之一，南海问题在本届香会上引起了广泛的讨论。先是中美两国防长在会面中探讨南海问题，后是中方当面针对关于南海虚假叙事的反驳，再有小马科斯在发表演说时对南海问题的颠倒黑白。可以说南海问题已经和半岛问题和台湾问题一样，成为了亚太地区亟待解决的地区问题之一。\n\n6月2日，在总台发布的报道中，一幅中国海警在执法时，被菲律宾\"坐滩\"军舰上的人员用枪口指着的图片在网上流传，出现在各大媒体头版。\n\n报道指出，在5月19日，菲律宾方面再次组织力量强闯仁爱礁，向非法\"坐滩\"的马德雷山号运送补给，我方海警部门前往事发海域进行执法时，在甲板上的菲方军事人员把枪口对准了我方的执法人员。此举毫无疑问是对中方明目张胆的挑衅，菲律宾的嚣张气焰可见一斑。\n\n不过菲律宾很快便\"倒打一耙\"。在6月3日，菲律宾媒体报道称，一个常年为仁爱礁非法运送物品的菲律宾民间组织发表言论，在5月19日当天，菲律宾派往仁爱礁的4艘橡皮艇，悉数遭到中国海警的拦截，船上的食品以及药品等物资也都被扣押。\n\n根据台媒中时新闻网的报道，为了让菲律宾打消抢夺补给的念头，中方执法人员将这些补给全部倾倒入海中。\n\n报道指出，在执法过程中，两艘中方海警船为了阻止菲方船只强闯仁爱礁，与其发生了摩擦。据称中方的海警船直接向菲方船只的马达发射了水炮，并且双方船只之间还出现了碰撞的情况。\n\n菲律宾方面随后谈到相关话题时，把中方合理合法地维护国家领土行为形容为\"偷窃补给物资的海盗行为\"。但是菲方的报道却忽略了一个事实，就是所有事件的发生地，都是在中国的领土范围内。事实上，他们就是故意模糊这一点，从而达到歪曲事实、颠倒黑白的目的。\n\n不过我们换个角度看，如果扣押菲律宾补给的事情为真，那么这也意味着中国海警在仁爱礁的执法已经出现了明显变化。\n\n一直以来，中菲双方在仁爱礁海域多有对峙和摩擦，但是基于人道主义精神，我方都是对相关船只进行监控以及驱离，大部分时候，都会对菲律宾运送必要生活物资的船只作出特殊安排，几乎不会出现扣押、倾倒补给物资的情况。\n\n那么，为什么中方这次会采取这种方式来应对菲律宾的非法行为呢？\n\n首先，关于这个问题，中方在香格里拉对话会期间曾经有过暗示。\n\n在发表《中国的全球安全观》的主旨演讲时，中方明确提到，一直以来，中方对南海某些国家的侵权挑衅行径，保持了足够的克制，但这也是有限度的。希望个别国家要认清利害关系，回归对话协商的正道，同地区国家一道，把南海建成和平、友谊、合作之海。\n\n换言之，菲律宾的蓄意挑衅，甚至公然枪指中国执法人员的行为，已经超出了中方忍耐的极限，为了捍卫领土主权和海洋权益，中方有必要采取更加强硬的行动。\n\n其次，在事件发生的前一天，也就是5月18日，菲律宾军方刚刚发表声明，与中方商定仁爱礁\"新模式\"菲律宾西部军区司令卡洛斯因为\"个人原因\"被休假，菲海军少将阿方索接替其职位。\n\n虽然菲方一再辩称此举与仁爱礁局势和\"录音门\"没有关系。但菲方此举无异于向世人表明，菲律宾方面不但出尔反尔，彻底否定双方商定的仁爱礁\"新模式\"，连菲方的谈判代表也要\"被背锅\"\"被株连\"。\n\n在此之前，中方已经数次给菲方台阶，但是菲律宾没有任何改变，在处理谈判人员的第二天就组织强闯仁爱礁，那么中方\"按规矩办事\"毫不为过。\n\n此外，就在本月中旬，我国颁布了《海警机构行政执法程序规定》，赋予中国的海警部队更多执法权力，其中包括中国海警将被赋予\"扣押外国船只以及对非法越境的外国人采取拘留审查\"的权利。\n\n该新规即将在6月15日正式施行，而菲律宾方面反应非常强烈，不仅宣扬\"中国意图在南海推行扩张主义\"的错误论调，还妄称要求中方遵守所谓\"具有约束力的南海仲裁案裁决\"。\n\n在这一次的行动中，中国海警虽然没有直接扣押菲律宾挑衅人员，但是却扣下了菲律宾非法运输的物资，这也是在提前演练未来可能上演的\"登船执法\"，这也是对菲律宾发出的提前警告。\n\n既然菲律宾全盘否认中菲的\"君子协议\"，那就应该做好准备，会面对中国海警的执法回应了。",

        "summary": "The article discusses a recent escalation in tensions between China and the Philippines over the Second Thomas Shoal (Ren'ai Reef). Chinese patience has reached its limit, leading to the Chinese Coast Guard intercepting and dumping supplies from Philippine vessels into the sea. This incident occurred on May 19, when the Philippines attempted to deliver supplies to the grounded BRP Sierra Madre. Chinese Coast Guard personnel were reportedly threatened at gunpoint by Philippine military personnel during the operation.\n\nThe Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore highlighted the South China Sea issue, with discussions involving defense ministers from China and the U.S., and remarks from Philippine President Marcos. The article suggests that China's response marks a significant shift in its approach, moving from monitoring and expelling vessels to more assertive actions, including dumping supplies.\n\nThe article also notes that the Philippines has accused China of piracy, while China maintains that the actions occurred within its territorial waters. The incident reflects China's frustration with ongoing provocations and its intent to defend its territorial sovereignty more robustly. Additionally, new Chinese regulations granting the Coast Guard more enforcement powers are set to take effect on June 15, signaling a potential increase in future confrontations."

This arrangement was seen as a deliberate move by the organizers, who are influenced by Western interests, to highlight regional conflicts and attract attention. Additionally, Ukrainian President Zelensky was invited, while no Russian representatives were present, likely due to the organizers' decision not to invite them, reflecting their stance and alignment with Western perspectives."

        "body": "张志新 中国现代国际关系研究院美国研究所副研究员\n\n5月31日下午，在新加坡举行的第21届香格里拉对话会期间，中国国防部长董军与美国国防部长奥斯汀举行近两年以来的首次会晤。据悉，包括两军高层沟通、中美国防部工作会晤、中美海上军事安全磋商机制会议等中美军方各层级的交流机制，都已经恢复运转。这不仅标志着两军高层交往的全面恢复，也意味着双方都致力于通过管控分歧以避免走向直接冲突和全面对抗。\n\n中美国防部长的会晤是近期两国积极互动系列成果之一。一方面，两国元首外交不断对中美关系持续稳步发展提供战略指引。2023年11月，习近平主席在与拜登总统在旧金山会晤中提出的\"旧金山愿景\"，为发展中美关系擘画出新的宏伟蓝图。其间，习近平主席特别指出，中美应当共同有效管控分歧，不能让分歧成为横亘在两国之间的鸿沟，而是要想办法架起相向而行的桥梁。4月2日，习近平主席在两国元首通话中提出，今年中美关系要坚持的三大原则，即以和为贵，坚守不冲突不对抗的底线，不断提升对中美关系的正面预期；以稳为重，不折腾、不挑事、不越界，保持中美关系总体稳定；以信为本，用行动兑现各自承诺，将\"旧金山愿景\"转为\"实景\"。另一方面，两国在经贸、外交、军事等各层级的往来，也在为双边关系转圜累积善意、提供动能。除美国财政部长耶伦、国务卿布林肯先后访华以外，今年以来中美国防部工作会晤、2024年度中美海上军事安全磋商机制工作小组会议，以及中央军委国际军事合作办公室领导同美国助理国防部长视频通话都已进行。\n\n需要注意的是，此次中美国防部长会晤的时空背景与以往有所不同。\n\n其一，近期美国拜登政府打着\"促进地区合作\"的旗号持续推进所谓\"印太战略\"，实质上却是在构建封闭排他的遏华\"俱乐部\"与\"小圈子\"，制造地区的分裂、对峙与对抗，与区域国家求和平谋发展的意愿背道而驰。正因为如此，国防部长董军在与奥斯汀的会晤中表示，中方坚持把以和为贵、以稳为重、以信为本作为基本遵循，在平等和尊重的基础上，构建不冲突、不对抗、开放务实合作，逐步积累互信的两军关系；美方应切实把两国元首达成的重要共识，言行一致地落实到军事领域，体现在具体行动上。\n\n其二，当前台海形势异常严峻，赖清德在所谓\"就职演说\"中赤裸裸贩卖\"两国论\"，妄图\"倚美谋独\"\"以武谋独\"，而美方不断通过窜访、提升交流层级、助台拓展\"国际空间\"，甚至加速对台军售\"助台谋独\"。美国武装台湾、公然干涉中国内政、破坏台海的和平与稳定，已经成为破坏中国和平统一大业的最大外来因素。因此，董军部长在会晤中就台湾问题表达了中方的坚定立场。他表示，台湾问题纯属中国内政，外部势力无权干涉；美方做法严重违反一个中国原则和中美三个联合公报规定，严重违背其所做的承诺，向\"台独\"分裂势力发出严重错误信号，中方坚决反对。\n\n其三，去年以来南海波澜再起，与美西方等外部势力对菲律宾的怂恿和支持密不可分。美国在南海问题上的态度暴露了其借南海问题破坏中国与周边国家关系、牵制中国崛起的图谋。就在今年5月，菲律宾鼓动百艘渔船侵闯中国黄岩岛海域，遭到中国海警的断然拦截。针对中国履行国际法义务、在南海实施的伏季休渔制度，菲律宾无理炒作中国\"以大欺小\"\"以强凌弱\"。在6月1日上午的演讲中，奥斯汀依然宣称，美国将继续与菲律宾等\"印太\"地区国家合作，\"解决他们的担忧，确保他们的权利得到保护\"。但对于美国的这番\"好意\"，并不是所有的地区国家都领情。例如，泰国前外交部长卡西特·皮罗米亚就表示，东盟的共同努力是为了和平与共同繁荣，而不是别的。董军防长特别针对南海当前态势对奥斯汀表示，在仁爱礁等问题上，中方的态度和底线是明确的，我们坚持平等协商解决分歧，但对加剧挑衅的行为绝不置之不理。\n\n总而言之，正如国防部发言人所表示的，此次中美两国防长在新加坡举行的会晤是积极、务实、富有建设性的战略沟通。也有外媒评论指出，这次会晤为中美两个大国在争议问题上展开更多军方对话带来希望。两军高层之间的沟通无疑有助于增进彼此之间的了解、消除战略误解和误判，累积互信、管控分歧。但是对美方而言，尤其需要认识到\"行胜于言\"，因为说一千道一万，如果美方对于中美关系的积极承诺不能落实在行动上，那就只是空话。",

Notably, President Xi Jinping's \"San Francisco Vision\" and principles for U.S.-China relations emphasize non-conflict, stability, and trust.\n2. **Regional Tensions**: The meeting occurred against a backdrop of heightened tensions, including the U.S.'s Indo-Pacific strategy perceived as countering China, and the sensitive Taiwan issue, where China opposes U.S. support for Taiwan's independence.\n3. **South China Sea Disputes**: The South China Sea remains a contentious area, with recent incidents involving the Philippines and U.S. support for regional allies. China maintains a firm stance on its territorial claims and opposes external interference.\n\nThe meeting was seen as constructive, aiming to enhance mutual understanding and manage strategic differences. However, the effectiveness of these dialogues depends on the U.S. translating its commitments into concrete actions."

        "body": "【中国网评】中国防长强调的\"三个不允许\"点明亚太问题的症结\n\n6月2日，中国国防部长董军在第21届香格里拉对话会上围绕\"中国的全球安全观\"作大会发言。董军在讲话中强调了三个\"不允许\"：\"不允许霸权主义、强权政治损害亚太\"\"不允许把地缘冲突、冷战热战引入亚太\"\"不允许任何国家、任何势力在这里生战生乱\"。\n\n三个\"不允许\"清楚地点明了当前亚太地区安全问题的症结，就是某些域内国家\"引狼入室\"，与域外国家相勾结，企图把地缘冲突、冷战热战引入亚太；就是某些超级大国，企图在亚太生战生乱，以此维护自身霸权地位。而包括中国在内的广大亚太国家绝不会坐视不理。中方的正义呼声，反映了地区国家求和平、求发展，反对霸权主义、反对强权政治的共同心声。\n\n近年来，菲律宾频频强闯中方拥有主权的南海岛礁，通过\"碰瓷\"制造事端，进而反诬中国\"违反国际法\"。而作为域外国家的美国，则一再以所谓\"航行自由\"\"国际仲裁\"为借口，摆出\"主持公道\"的架势，却为菲律宾摇旗呐喊，企图挑拨中国与周边国家的关系，在亚太地区制造阵营对立。\n\n实际上，菲律宾觊觎中国南海岛礁久矣。20世纪60年代末70年代初，由于南沙群岛附近海域勘测出油气资源，菲律宾打起了强占中国岛礁的歪主意。为此，菲律宾一直想拉美国入局为自己撑腰，但早在20世纪50年代便与菲律宾签订《美菲共同防御条约》的美国，却在很长一段时间里冷对菲律宾的诉求。2012年4月30日，在美菲首次\"2+2\"高层磋商会上，时任美国国务卿希拉里明确表示，美国对南海领土主权争议问题不持立场，美国支持采取相互合作的外交程序解决争端。同年12月13日，时任美军太平洋司令洛克利尔在菲律宾参加会议时重申，美国在中菲领土争端中不采取立场，美国呼吁争端得到和平解决。\n\n然而不久之后，美国在南海问题上的\"中立姿态\"迅速崩塌。2013年1月22日，菲律宾在美国的支持和怂恿下，单方面发起所谓\"南海仲裁案\"。同年12月5日，美国海军提康德罗加级导弹巡洋舰\"考本斯\"号在南海海域监视我国辽宁号航空母舰时，险些和中国军舰相撞。消息称，事发当天，美军巡洋舰已经进入我航母战斗群的内防区，挑衅意味浓厚。\n\n回溯历史就会发现，2013年前后菲律宾突然在南海问题上发难，美国悄悄放弃其\"中立立场\"，转变为菲律宾非法维权的幕后主使以及南海搅局者，都与美国的战略调整密切相关。2009年和2012年，奥巴马政府相继提出\"重返亚太\"和\"亚太再平衡\"战略，其实质都是加大在亚太地区的干涉力度，阻止中国的崛起势头。\n\n曾经\"中立的旁观者\"变成了\"积极的搅局者\"，只因为美国认为，若要给中国制造麻烦，南海问题是\"好用且廉价\"的筹码。而本就期盼美国入局的菲律宾，自然会心甘情愿、乐此不疲地充当美国的马前卒。\n\n在本次\"香会\"演讲中，菲律宾总统马科斯大谈所谓\"基于规则的国际秩序\"，呼吁中美理性竞争。然而媒体却发现，其演讲中频繁提到美国。有记者问及此，马科斯却沉默以对，场面颇为尴尬。菲律宾智库\"人民良政\"中心主任鲍比·图阿松则怒斥马科斯充当美国的喉舌和传声筒，是一种无耻的外交行为。\n\n马科斯的种种表现，再一次将美菲相互勾连，挑动地区紧张局势，企图把地缘冲突、冷战热战引入亚太的丑恶嘴脸摆上了台面。\n\n是非自有公论，公道自在人心。尽管美菲在南海问题上频繁制造事端，但正如\"三个不允许\"所说的那样，区域各国维护和平稳定大局、拒绝外来干预并主张通过友好协商解决内部分歧的步履不停、信心如磐。5月13日至15日，中国和东盟国家在泰国举行落实《南海各方行为宣言》第43次联合工作组会，推进了\"南海行为准则\"案文三读的工作。相信若东盟国家与中方一道，排除域外势力干扰，朝着既定目标不断前进，就一定能够达成有效、富有实质内容、符合国际法的\"准则\"，将南海建设成为和平之海、合作之海。",

These points highlight the core issues in the region, particularly the involvement of external powers like the U.S. and the actions of regional players like the Philippines, which have been accused of provoking disputes in the South China Sea.\n\nThe article criticizes the Philippines for its actions in the South China Sea and accuses the U.S. of abandoning its neutral stance to support the Philippines, thereby exacerbating tensions. It traces the shift in U.S. policy to strategic adjustments under the Obama administration's \"Pivot to Asia\" and \"Asia-Pacific Rebalance\" strategies, aimed at countering China's rise.\n\nThe article also mentions the recent speech by Philippine President Marcos at the Shangri-La Dialogue, where he called for a rules-based international order but was criticized for aligning too closely with the U.S. The piece concludes by emphasizing the importance of regional cooperation and dialogue, citing recent efforts by China and ASEAN to advance the South China Sea Code of Conduct, aiming to maintain peace and stability in the region."

        "body": "【环球时报赴新加坡特派记者 郭媛丹】6月2日上午，当中国国防部长董军在第21届香格里拉对话会（以下简称\"香会\"）上作大会发言时，新加坡香格里拉酒店会场内座无虚席。专程报道\"香会\"的《环球时报》记者观察到，中国防长发言环节结束后不久，在酒店大堂内拉着行李箱办退房手续的人陆续多了起来。一位多次参加\"香会\"的外媒同行表示，美国防长发言被安排在1日，中国防长发言在2日，\"大会议程之所以将两国防长发言分别放在两天，就是为了有看点，防止参会人员半途离会\"。不过，\"香会\"主办方一方面靠中方代表团\"撑场面\"，另一方面却在会议日程设计、演讲嘉宾安排上处处为中国\"设套\"、\"挖坑\"。接受记者采访的专家认为，中国解放军代表团参加\"香会\"是努力在不同中寻找相同，在不确定性中寻找确定性，而有些国家则是在相同中找不同，蓄意挑事。\n\n新加坡香格里拉大酒店，第21届香格里拉对话会举行。（视觉中国）\n\n当地时间2024年6月2日，新加坡，中国国防部长董军在香格里拉对话会围绕\"中国的全球安全观\"作大会主旨发言。（视觉中国）\n\n马科斯歪曲渲染海上事态，奥斯汀发言给予支持\n\n\"香会\"由英国智库国际战略研究所（IISS）主办，是目前亚太地区安全对话机制中规模最大、规格最高的多边会议之一，也被称为\"亚洲安全峰会\"。按照议程设置，大会有3场重头戏：开幕晚宴上一位国家领导人发言、第二天美国防长发言、第三天中国防长发言。今年3月，IISS就在其官网上宣布菲律宾总统马科斯将出席\"香会\"，并在开幕晚宴上作主旨发言，这是3位重量级嘉宾中最早确定下来的一位，也是\"香会\"首次邀请菲律宾总统发表主旨演讲。\n\n新加坡《联合早报》此前报道称：\"南海紧张局势预计会是区域国家'舌战'的主轴。菲律宾可能会在美国和其他一些国家的撑腰下把矛头对准中国，中国面对的压力会比往年更大。\"\n\n果不其然，马科斯的发言大谈南海问题，并声称菲律宾的主权和管辖权继续受到\"非法、胁迫、侵略和欺骗行为\"的侵犯。对菲方有关表态罔顾历史和事实，宣扬其涉海错误立场，歪曲渲染海上事态，中国外交部已阐明中方立场，并敦促菲方重信守诺，立即停止海上侵权挑衅，尽快回到通过对话协商妥善处理海上矛盾分歧的正确轨道上来。\n\n多位参与\"香会\"的中外人士认为，\"香会\"作为亚太地区防务论坛，却展示出深深的美国五角大楼印记。比如美国防长奥斯汀在第二天的发言中就对马科斯的言论给予支持，并表示每个国家，无论大小，都有权享有自己的海洋资源。他还声称，菲律宾\"所面临的骚扰是危险的\"，确保南海保持\"自由开放\"符合共同利益。在提问环节，奥斯汀也强调了《美菲共同防御条约》\"坚定如铁\"。\n\n除此之外，今年\"香会\"的一个临时性安排，也能反映出美国对此次大会的影响。在奥斯汀发言结束之后，IISS便宣布乌克兰总统泽连斯基将出席\"香会\"并发言。《环球时报》记者在现场发现，在2日中午泽连斯基发言之际，奥斯汀提前在会场门口等候，与泽连斯基一同进入会场，这一举动像是在有意传递出美国支持乌克兰的信号。\n\n参会的解放军代表团成员潘庆华2日在新加坡对《环球时报》记者表示，无论是欢迎晚宴上马科斯演讲，还是第一次全体会议上奥斯汀演讲，包括一些政治人物的临时出席，种种\"巧合性\"安排，容易让人们认为，\"IISS试图在议题设置上制造围堵中国的话题，其议程安排也可能是出于抵消中国军队声音对外传播的考量\"。\n\n不仅如此，IISS公布的演讲名单中共有42位嘉宾，《环球时报》记者一一核对后发现，其中一半来自亚洲地区，而近2/3的发言者来自美国或美国盟友。除了东盟国家，出席会议的很多高级代表团也都是来自美国在亚太和北约的盟友。\n\n解放军代表团成员、军事科学院战争研究院研究员曹延中在新加坡接受《环球时报》记者采访时表示，美国的北约盟友\"千里迢迢\"来到新加坡发表所谓\"对亚太安全的看法\"，是在配合美国把更多对立、对抗带到会场上来。比如东欧国家立陶宛的代表在发言中表示，该国出台了一个所谓的\"印太战略\"，这是在\"不加掩饰地随美起舞\"。\n\n曹延中说：\"从一系列细节中可以看出，主办方提供了一个舞台，围绕所谓'基于规则的国际秩序'，通过各国代表团发言及舆论配合渲染所谓'中国威胁'。\"\n\n中国国防部新闻发言人一连回答17个问题\n\n\"香会\"的两面性还体现在舆论场上。参会中方代表团成员在香格里拉酒店一向是被世界媒体高度关注的，一方面，媒体希望从代表团那里获得尽可能多的信息，但另一方面一些西方媒体会进行倾向性报道，刻意放大中方代表团的一些表态，又无视中国真正对外传递的热爱和平、命运与共的理念。\n\n\"塔楼翼1006\"是今年\"香会\"期间中方代表团的临时\"发布厅\"。在\"香会\"期间，中方代表团共举行了4次记者会，发布人有国防部新闻发言人、官员以及专家学者，最大可能地满足了媒体的诉求。比如第一场记者会的主题是关于中美防长会谈，主持人是国防部新闻发言人吴谦。而最后一次与记者见面的则是代表团的军事专家们，记者注意到他们的行李箱就放在走廊上，专家们接受完媒体采访就离开酒店。\n\n在中美防长会谈的现场，美方工作人员明确表示，会谈后美方不会召开吹风会，只会发布一则新闻简讯。而相比较之下，在中美防长会谈结束15分钟之后，吴谦就出现在香格里拉酒店的临时\"发布厅\"，迎接他的是来自法新社、美国《纽约时报》、英国《金融时报》等几十家媒体的记者，后来的记者都只能席地而坐。在介绍完中美防长会谈的基本情况后，吴谦总共回应了17个提问，直至没有记者再举手提问。\n\n这17个问题内容十分丰富，比如追问中美防长会谈究竟谈出了什么新成果，双方在规避风险时有没有达成新的准则等等。吴谦也说明了自己的身份和职能范围，表示并不能准确回应所有问题，但依旧对记者们的疑问给出了个人的观点。比如在回应\"中美两国在哪些方面还可以增强合作\"这一问题时，吴谦表示，中美两军之间有着很多的共同利益，但也确实存在分歧。双方需要积累互信，并且不断扩大互信，因此双方可以从一些不太敏感的领域先做起来，比如军事院校的沟通交流。\n\n会后，有数位与《环球时报》记者相熟的外媒记者表示，发布会非常不错，能感受到发言人非常积极地解答媒体的提问，\"这是一个与中国解放军代表团深入沟通的机会，比较难得\"。\n\n\"短期内'西强我弱'的舆论格局还难以改变，国际舆论场上美西方声音大一些、多一些，这是客观现实。但我们也可以明显感受到，中国军队的声音正在自然注入国际舆论场，我们的声音越来越被听见、被重视、被接受。\"潘庆华举例说，会议期间他们几次通知媒体开吹风会，多家媒体因为之前没抢到位置，提前四五十分钟就来抢位占座，这表明媒体是十分关注中国声音的。\n\n还有一个细节体现出记者在会上遭遇不公平对待。在主办方发布的美国代表团名单中包括很多家媒体，在与其中一家媒体的记者聊天时，《环球时报》记者发现中美记者的证件不同，对方享有更多的权限，而这位记者并没有额外做过申请，是主办方主动为他们升级的。这位记者坦言：\"这的确不公平。\"\n\n潘庆华认为，尽管\"香会\"是西方国家的主场，但我们愿意借助这个平台，把一个全面、立体、真实的中国军队介绍给世界。事实上，长期以来中国军队为国际社会提供了大量国际公共安全产品，比如国际维和、远洋护航等。\"我们做了很多维护世界和平的事情，不应该被随意贴上负面标签，我们有责任向世界讲清楚我们的国防政策和理念主张，这也是中国军队应邀参会的一个重要原因。我们在共建人类命运共同体理念的指导下，致力于推动亚太地区的安全与发展，努力在不同中寻找相同，在不确定性中寻求确定性。\"\n\n会场上的\"大国效应\"：中美防长发言最受关注\n\n参加\"香会\"的人都会注意到一个现象：在两天的正式会议期间，只有美国和中国两个国家防长讲话时听众会给予高度热情，无论是会场内还是媒体室都会出现\"一座难求\"的场景。相较之下，其他发言嘉宾的听众明显少很多，有媒体将这种现象形容为\"大国效应\"。\n\n已经第三次参加\"香会\"的曹延中告诉《环球时报》记者，参会最深刻的感受是，一些西方国家一方面要中国承担大国责任，另一方面又觉得中国作为大国，对其造成潜在威胁，处处要对中国进行围堵和抵制。他说：\"作为美西方主导的国际话语平台，主办方刻意'设套'，想方设法把各种议题引向中国，包括南海、台海问题，似乎一切问题都出在中国身上。而对美国，会场上几乎听不到什么批评声。这就是国际话语权斗争的现实。\"\n\n在这背后，其实是美国并没有做好心理准备接受中国已经成为一个大国的现实。以中方学者身份参加\"香会\"的清华大学战略与安全研究中心研究员周波对《环球时报》记者表示：\"面对中国快速发展并成为世界第二大经济体，美国精英阶层是无法接受的，这也是美国从战略上对中国进行打压的根本原因。\"\n\n奥斯汀宣称：\"只有亚洲安全，美国才能安全。\"他还强调美国坚定致力于维护印太地区安全的承诺，但这种承诺需要借助美国在印太地区的盟友和伙伴关系的力量。周波表示：\"目前美国的精力被牵制在欧洲和中东战场，因此其支持马科斯在南海滋事挑衅，又在台湾问题上'切香肠'，以此遏制中国发展。\"周波补充道：\"在关键问题上美国人还是想得明白的，美国绝对不想和中国爆发战争。\"\n\n针对菲律宾挑起与中国的争端，周波表示，\"两个国家一旦产生争端，由于人们天生同情弱者，大国实际上会处于不利地位。当前国际社会被菲律宾的'卖惨'遮蔽了双眼。但真相是，在历史上动过手的国家是菲律宾，数次杀伤中国大陆和台湾地区的渔民。\"\n\n曹延中说，无论是台海问题还是南海问题，都是历史遗留问题。中国对南海的主张由来已久，并不是中国发展壮大后才有的。中国奉行防御性的国防政策，既没有扩张的动机，也没有扩张的打算，东盟国家可以充分感受到这一点。\n\n印尼当选总统普拉博沃在1日的发言中表示，印尼奉行不结盟政策，尽可能与所有国家维持良好关系，他引述\"远亲不如近邻\"的道理，说明真正的地区安全来自与邻国的良好关系。\n\n作为中国国防部国际军事合作办公室安全合作中心前主任，周波经常接受英国广播公司、彭博社等知名国际媒体的采访。他告诉《环球时报》记者：\"中西方媒体关注问题的角度并不相同，这是源于双方在认知、历史文化背景等因素上的差异。因为意识形态不同以及对中国先入为主的刻板印象，西方媒体的问题会带有明显的倾向性。但与西方媒体积极主动地沟通是讲述中国故事的机会，听众会有自己的判断。\"\n\n2日晚间，记者再度踏入香格里拉酒店，安保设施、\"香会\"的宣传牌等已全部被撤走，大堂内安静、冷清，与大会期间的人声鼎沸似乎是两个世界。褪去政治场上的争论，无论是西方还是东方，没有人想要战争，和平才是最大的渴望，幸福生活才是最大的追求。在对这个目标的追求之路上，中国和世界彼此需要。争议方与其相互争论、制造矛盾，不如坐下来谈话，用务实的态度共同解决问题。",

The event, organized by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), featured key speeches from the U.S. and Chinese defense ministers on separate days to maintain interest.\n\nPhilippine President Marcos, in his opening speech, criticized China's actions in the South China Sea, supported by U.S. Defense Secretary Austin. Austin emphasized the importance of maritime rights and U.S. support for the Philippines. The event also saw a surprise appearance by Ukrainian President Zelensky, signaling U.S. support for Ukraine.\n\nChinese experts noted that the event's agenda seemed designed to challenge China, with a significant presence of U.S. and allied representatives. Despite this, the Chinese delegation actively engaged with the media, addressing numerous questions and emphasizing China's commitment to peace and regional stability.\n\nThe dialogue highlighted the ongoing struggle for international narrative dominance, with the U.S. and its allies often framing China as a threat. However, Chinese representatives stressed their defensive policies and contributions to global security, advocating for dialogue and cooperation over conflict."

Giegerich）进行主持人致辞后，董军微笑着走上前台。\n\n\"在当今世界变乱交织、各国人民更加渴望和平发展之际，亚太数十年的繁荣稳定、举世瞩目的'亚太奇迹'，为世界发展注入强大动力，为全球安全提供稳定基石，带给我们带很多重要启示。\"\n\n用温和的语调为\"中国的全球安全观\"演讲开场后，董军话锋一转，\"脱钩断链、小院高墙在这里没有市场。\"\n\n董军提到，\"我们不允许霸权主义、强权政治损害亚太，不允许把地缘冲突、冷战热战引入地区，不允许任何国家、任何势力在这里生战生乱！\"\n\n随后，董军点出中国的国防政策和理念，他说，中方崇尚以和为贵，寻求共同安全，秉持平等尊重，注重开放包容，同时坚决捍卫核心利益。\n\n提到台湾问题时，董军强调，台湾问题是中国核心利益中的核心，一个中国原则早已成为世界公认的国际关系的基本准则。\n\n他表示，维护国家主权和领土完整是中国军队的神圣使命，我们将以及时坚决有力的作为，扼止\"台独\"，确保其图谋永无得逞之日。\n\n在南海问题上，董军提到，当前南海局势总体稳定，希望个别国家认清利害关系，回归对话协商的正道。他表示，我们坚持通过对话协商解决分歧，鄙视丛林法则，在处理边界和海上分歧中，从不主动挑起事端，从不轻易付诸武力，始终与各国共同努力，推动落实《南海各方行为宣言》，加紧\"南海行为准则\"磋商，有力维护了地区的和平安宁。\n\n对于如何构建亚太安全，董军表示，中方愿同各方一道，维护各国正当安全利益，共创公正合理国际秩序，发挥地区安全架构作用，推进开放务实防务合作，打造海上安全合作典范，加强新型领域安全治理，开创地区安全合作新局面，推动亚太继续成为全球发展稳定之锚。\n\n超过30分钟的大会演讲，董军向世界阐释了\"中国的全球安全观\"。\n\n面对\"香会\"提问环节，董军的回应掷地有声。\n\n第一轮问答时，美国《华盛顿邮报》专栏作家乔什·罗金（Josh Rogin）提问，\"中方是否寻求台湾和平统一\"。董军防长用约十余分钟的时间再次阐述中国在台湾问题上的政策立场。\n\n\"香会\"一向被视为欧美主导的安全会议，在问答环节，主持人吉格里奇三四次尝试管控时间、打断董军发言，但董军仍坚持讲明中国对台湾问题的基本立场。\n\n\"香会\"开幕由菲律宾总统小马科斯发表演讲，涉及南海问题。美国专家葛来仪(Bonnie

Pavilion）会晤。\n\n园中亭是美方举办双边会议的老场地。抵达园中亭前，需走过一条花园水池小径，四周绿叶葱郁，流水潺潺。\n\n这是时隔18个月后，中美防长再度面对面正式会晤。\n\n31摄氏度的气温使\"中美防长会晤\"更加热闹。会议室内，中美防长正就两军关系、台湾问题、南海问题、乌克兰危机、巴以冲突等交换意见。通往\"园中亭\"厅的长廊两侧，超过30名中外媒体记者架着相机、举着手机焦急地等候。\n\n14时12分左右，董军防长及代表团成员走出会场。他的黑框眼镜镜片瞬时浮起一层薄薄的水雾，随即他就被守候在此的众多中外媒体记者\"包围\"。\n\n\"谢谢大家关注，一会儿我的同事会向大家介绍情况的。\"董军举起右手，稍作停歇，环顾一众媒体说。\n\n约5分钟后，奥斯汀低着头、抿嘴微笑离开会场，从另一侧小径走向了酒店花园。\n\n参加\"香会\"一周前，奥斯汀因健康问题接受了两个半小时的治疗。\n\n世界的目光也锁定在这场时隔18个月的中美防长对话。中国国防部新闻发言人吴谦在会谈结束后十分钟就召开吹风会，他透露，这场会谈比预计的一小时更久，共持续了75分钟。吴谦表示，\"这是一次积极、务实、富有建设性的战略沟通。\"\n\n\"见比不见要好，谈比不谈要好。\"吴谦表示，但同时我们也不可能期待双方仅仅通过一次会谈，就解决中美两军之间存在的所有问题。\n\n在记者提问环节，吴谦提到，中国反对\"麦克风外交\"，\"防长间的面对面沟通非常重要\"。\n\n\"中美双方十分期盼防长沟通和交流，这既落实两国元首旧金山峰会的共识，也促进了两军关系的健康稳定发展。\"中国军事科学院研究员童真告诉南方周末记者。\n\n外媒多用\"罕见\"一词形容此次中美防长会晤。\"这给双方带来更多军事对话的希望，有助于防止台湾问题和其他热点问题的争端失控。\"美联社刊文称。\n\n中美代表团的\"香会\"互动，已成为\"中美关系的晴雨表\"。\"'香会'上有时会愿意倾听，有时会用言辞打架。我作为一个医生，认为预防比治疗更重要。\"新加坡防长黄永宏说。\n\n与会代表也透过奥斯汀的大会演讲观察\"中美两军关系\"。自奥斯汀任美国防长以来，四次访问新加坡，三次出席\"香会\"。\n\n\"奥斯汀的此次演讲，算是2023年演讲的姊妹篇，不过对中方态度却略显缓和。\"军事科学院原副院长何雷向南方周末记者分析。何雷是\"香会\"的老朋友。2017年至2018年，他曾两度带团参会。此外，他还多次随团参会。\n\n\"但是，不能光看人怎么说，还要看人怎么做。希望奥斯汀防长能够说到做到，真正落实两国元首达成的重要共识，这样亚太国家才能真的放心。\"何雷说。\n\n听完奥斯汀主题演讲之后，国防大学国家安全学院副教授张弛告诉南方周末记者，\"有种自相矛盾的感觉。\"\n\n他表示，一方面，奥斯汀宣称美国致力于维护亚太地区的和平稳定和繁荣，另一方面，又极力鼓吹要强化美国在亚太地区的联盟和伙伴关系，尤其是要大力发展各种小规模的多边合作机制。\n\n\"实际上这些合作机制恰恰是排他性的，它与东盟一贯倡导的开放包容价值观相违背。而这种做法也将推动阵营对立，加剧紧张局势，不利于亚太地区的和平与发展。\"张弛说。\n\n不过，新加坡南洋理工大学拉惹勒南国际研究院副教授李明江告诉南方周末记者，中美不太可能采取军事冲突方式解决两国间的某些重大问题。\n\n美方试图打造\"和平繁荣的印太地区\"战略未变，但久违的防长会晤给两方带来了积极效应。\n\n那么，中美两军如何增强合作？吴谦认为，两军可以先开展军事院校交流，以及一些政策对话。\"万事开头难，但是不管怎么样，我们先做起来，路虽远行必至。\"吴谦坦言。\n\n繁忙的五天\n\n\"对话协商是解决矛盾分歧的首选\"\n\n中国军方代表团于5月29日飞抵新加坡，开启为期五天的军事外交访问。\n\n代表团的行程颇为忙碌。香会期间，董军与美国、加拿大、泰国、日本、澳大利亚、法国、柬埔寨、新西兰等国防务部门领导和红十字国际委员会主席、欧盟外交与安全政策高级代表会谈。\n\n访问新加坡无疑是此次行程的重头戏之一。\n\n5月29日上午，董军在新加坡防长黄永宏的陪同下检阅了仪仗队。之后，举行了中新防长对话。\n\n被问及会谈内容时，黄永宏在6月2日告诉南方周末记者，他认为这次部长对话取得了良好进展，双方同意加强包括海军在内的各军种交流。\n\n\"从双边的角度来看，我认为非常富有成效，我希望继续合作。\"黄永宏说。\n\n访新期间，这位海军出身的国防部长还走访了新加坡樟宜海军基地，登上了新加坡\"威武级\"护卫舰\"坚信号\"，随后参观了新加坡海军博物馆。其中，\"威武级\"护卫舰曾多次与中国海军一起演习，最近一次是在2023年。\n\n中新陆军自2009年起进行合作演习，今年将第六次举行。海军则在2015年开始海事合作演习，到今年已经是第三次举行。\n\n新加坡国防部新闻称，董军到访凸显了\"持久、温暖、友好\"的中新防务关系。\n\n在此次\"香会\"期间，日本防卫大臣木原稔也是第一次与董军见面。这是中日防长时隔一年来首次正式会晤。据日媒披露细节，中日防长会谈在6月1日举行，持续约50分钟。\n\n木原稔指出，日中在安全领域存在许多关切事项，希望\"双方防务部门加强讨论\"。日媒报道称，双方商定，可妥善使用2023年启用的\"中日防务直通热线\"，推进对话与交流。\n\n日本《每日新闻》6月1日报道，对于参加\"香会\"的历任日本防卫大臣来说，与中国国防部长的会面都是\"重中之重\"。此前\"香会\"上，中日防长也多次就东海、南海局势等问题展开论战。\n\n回顾可见，最近一次中日防长互访，还要追溯到2019年。《中日和平友好条约》缔结40周年之际，时任日本防卫大臣河野太郎应邀开启对中国的两日正式访问。而在中日防长未互访的几年里，\"香会\"为双方沟通创造了机会。\n\n军事科学院原副院长何雷向南方周末记者表示，中日隔海相望，有友好的传统。同时，日本曾对华发起侵略战争，必须要吸取这方面的教训，不能搞重走军国主义的道路，不能够搞军事扩张。\n\n\"对话\"是历届\"香会\"的主题，也是此次董军此行的关键词之一。\"对话\"，不仅在香会会场，也在防长间的午餐会和晚宴等多个场合。\n\n6月1日的\"防长午餐会\"，是黄永宏部长的\"香会\"例行招待。\n\n当日13时，董军进入栀子花厅，黄永宏陆续将荷兰防长奥隆格伦、澳大利亚防长马尔斯等人引荐给董军。\n\n\"我们聊了俄乌冲突，希望能有外交解决的机会。我们还讨论了加沙和以色列的局势，希望能在10月7日前寻求更大稳定性。\"黄永宏在午餐会后的记者群访时表示。\n\n\"国防部长是一个非常官方的岗位，两国防长间首先是重要的工作的关系。但是通过工作发展友谊，通过友谊再促进工作，这也是完全可以理解的，中方也一向对此持开放态度。\"吴谦在吹风会上说。",

        "body": "【环球时报综合报道】针对菲律宾总统马科斯日前在新加坡举行的第21届香格里拉对话会（以下简称\"香会\"）上发表涉南海问题演讲，中国外交部发言人3日答记者问时表示，菲方有关表态罔顾历史和事实，宣扬其涉海错误立场，歪曲渲染海上事态。最近一段时间，菲律宾在南海动作不断，一方面背信弃义，持续否认与中方就妥善管控南海局势达成的\"君子协定\"和内部谅解；另一方面反复在仁爱礁和黄岩岛海域挑衅，严重侵犯中国的领土主权。多名中国专家3日接受《环球时报》记者采访时表示，菲方在南海频频挑衅的言论和行动，依靠的完全是并不可靠的所谓\"美国的支持\"，这不仅违反《南海各方行为宣言》，而且引入域外势力干预南海事务，可能\"毁灭区域和平\"。中国外交部发言人3日点名批评，\"美国出于地缘政治私利，支持配合菲方的侵权行径，利用南海问题挑拨中国与地区国家关系，扮演了极不光彩的角色\"。\n\n\"自欺欺人不会让菲方取信于国际社会\"\n\n针对马科斯在\"香会\"上的演讲，中国外交部3日在官网以发言人答记者问的形式发布新闻稿，阐明中国的立场。发言人指出，近期中菲南海问题升温的责任完全在菲方。菲律宾违背自身承诺和中菲共识，违反《南海各方行为宣言》，出尔反尔、背信弃义；频繁在海上侵权挑衅、制造事端；伙同域外势力在南海拉帮结派、炫耀武力；四处散播污蔑抹黑中方的虚假信息，误导国际社会认知。发言人还质问，\"当前菲律宾外交政策为谁服务，海上行动为谁卖命，明眼人看得很清楚，自欺欺人不会让菲方取信于国际社会。\"\n\n南京大学国际关系学院执行院长朱锋3日接受《环球时报》记者采访时表示，中国外交部发言人发表的答记者问清楚地阐述了中菲在南海争议的来源和脉络。他说，近一段时期以来，菲律宾基于国内政治的考虑和域外大国的煽动挑拨，故意激化南海局势，违背了《南海各方行为宣言》等东盟与中国一系列已经达成的处理南海争端的基本原则。中方的声明实际上对中菲问题再度起到正本清源的重要作用。\n\n暨南大学国际关系学院副院长代帆3日对《环球时报》记者说，中方的声明对中国在南海的权益和主张、对近来南海问题升温的责任说得非常明确。即便如此，中方在声明中仍然认为，在中国和东盟国家的共同努力下，南海局势保持总体稳定。各国依法享有的航行和飞越自由不存在任何问题。中方将继续坚定维护自身的领土主权和海洋权益，同时始终坚持同直接有关当事国在尊重历史事实的基础上，通过谈判协商妥处涉海矛盾分歧。这显示出中国是从整个地区局势的和平稳定出发，采取非常理性和负责任的态度来处理涉南海问题。\n\n\"疯了？还是战争贩子？\"\n\n与此同时，有域外国家对马科斯涉南海问题的演讲兴奋不已。\"美国祝贺菲律宾雄辩地表达南海立场\"，《菲律宾星报》3日以此为题报道称，菲律宾国防部长特奥多罗和美国防长奥斯汀在\"香会\"期间举行会晤。奥斯汀在会晤开始时对马科斯阐述菲律宾涉南海问题的立场\"表示祝贺\"，并称\"菲律宾所面临的骚扰是危险的......我们不仅仅是朋友和盟友。影响你们的事情也会影响到我们\"。特奥多罗回应称，\"感谢美国支持马科斯强调小国权利的观点\"。\n\n马科斯5月31日在\"香会\"发表演讲时，针对菲中在南海愈演愈烈的海上摩擦与纠纷，他以所谓南海仲裁庭仲裁为由指责\"个别国家在领土和管辖范围外执行国内法\"。他还强硬地声称，\"我不打算屈服，菲律宾人从不屈服\"。\n\n在演讲后的答问环节，马科斯还宣称，如果菲律宾公民在冲突中被杀害，这将\"非常接近我们所定义的战争行为\"，马尼拉\"将作出相应回应\"，其盟友美国\"也将秉持同样的标准并支持菲律宾采取任何联合行动\"。法国国际广播公司称，这是\"菲律宾总统为南海冲突划战争红线\"。英国《简氏防务周刊》网站则称，马科斯的话意味着\"菲律宾可能把中美拖入战争\"。\n\n对此，参加\"香会\"的中国代表团成员、国防大学国际防务学院院长徐辉少将当场质问马科斯：\"近期菲律宾的行为看起来并没有考虑其他方面感受，这可能会毁灭区域的和平。你对此有什么看法？\"马科斯支支吾吾，答非所问，声称\"我不明白你在说什么\"。\n\n代帆说，无论是马科斯涉南海问题的演讲，还是美方的\"祝贺\"，都表明马科斯政府的外交政策，尤其是其对华政策和南海政策，正在偏离服务菲律宾国家利益的轨道，事实上是在服务美国的利益。\n\n菲律宾知名政论家、前总统阿罗约的发言人里戈贝托·蒂格劳3日在《马尼拉时报》发表题为《疯了？还是战争贩子？》的评论。文章称，马科斯大谈\"战争\"并篡改关于触发《美菲共同防御条约》的条件，\"不管是自吹自擂，是没睡醒，还是宿醉未醒，马科斯对中国的'好战'言论令人震惊\"。评论称，希望马科斯\"不会愚蠢到真的想对中国发动战争\"，即便他企图对中国发起\"冷战\"，也必将遭到中国的猛烈反击。\"我确信如果马科斯不迅速改变政策，他将会像1986年他父亲的命运一样\"。\n\n菲成为\"地区稳定背刺者\"\n\n近来，菲方不仅四处污蔑抹黑中国，还频频在南海挑衅。《菲律宾每日问询者报》3日援引消息人士的话称，菲律宾海军飞机5月19日向仁爱礁非法\"坐滩\"的菲方军舰进行空投物资，物资遭到中方扣押并被倾倒入海。报道称，中国海警船还阻碍菲方将生病士兵送回后方的行动。\n\n不过，新加坡《联合早报》称，中国媒体6月2日公布的视频显示，菲律宾对非法\"坐滩\"仁爱礁的军舰进行空投补给时，中国海警依法依规应对，而菲军舰上至少两名人员在甲板上持枪指着中国海警方向。\n\n菲方频频挑衅，底气是什么？许多分析认为，菲方自以为能够依靠\"美国的支持\"。马科斯在\"香会\"演讲中多次提到了美国。\"为什么菲律宾总统演讲总是提到美国？\"菲律宾海警司令罗尼·加万被媒体问及此事时，把责任全甩给总统本人，声称\"只听命总统\"；马科斯面对记者的追问，干脆默不作声、直接开溜。\n\n实际上，这对菲律宾是一个非常危险的局面。菲律宾\"亚洲世纪\"战略研究所所长赫尔曼·劳雷尔此前曾警告马科斯，\"某些域外国家对菲律宾所谓的支持缺乏可信度\"。他呼吁菲政府应回归理性，不要掉进某些国家\"谋求私利的陷阱\"。劳雷尔称，菲政府像美国的附庸，作为菲律宾人感到侮辱。在东盟，其他国家都不愿被美国拖入地缘冲突当中。不管是东盟还是其他成员国，都曾对菲律宾提出过委婉的批评，他们显然不认同菲律宾的南海政策，也不相信菲律宾将责任甩给中国的那套说辞。\n\n代帆说，菲律宾政府的外交政策，特别是对华政策和南海政策，在整个东盟都成为\"另类\"。在东盟地区与中国存在南海争议的国家中，选择挑衅对抗中国的国家只有菲律宾。菲律宾在南海的挑衅不仅不利于整个地区的和平稳定，而且菲方与域外大国勾结，破坏东盟致力维护地区稳定的原则。可以说，菲律宾已经成为\"地区稳定背刺者\"。\n\n徐辉少将接受媒体采访时称，菲律宾没有意识到自己已被东盟孤立。菲方引入域外势力干涉（南海）的行为违反了东盟（解决争端）的基本原则。他说，\"中国有所有手段可以解决中菲问题 ，但几十年来我们一直没有用军事手段，希望通过和平的方式解决问题。\"\n\n\"中国防长促回归对话协商正道\"，《菲律宾商报》3日称，中国国防部长董军2日在\"香会\"上表示，中方对侵权挑衅行径保持了足够的克制，但这也是有限度的。希望个别国家要认清利害关系，回归对话协商的正道。\n\n【环球时报驻菲律宾特派记者 樊帆 环球时报记者 李萌 刘彩玉 甄翔 陈康 柳玉鹏】",

China's Foreign Ministry criticized Marcos for distorting facts and escalating tensions, accusing the Philippines of violating agreements and provoking China in disputed areas like Ren'ai Reef and Huangyan Island. Chinese experts argue that the Philippines relies on unreliable U.S. support, which could destabilize regional peace.\n\nThe article highlights that the Philippines' actions contradict the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea and involve external forces, potentially harming regional stability. Chinese officials emphasize that the Philippines' recent provocations and misinformation campaigns are misleading the international community.\n\nThe article also notes that U.S. officials, including Defense Secretary Austin, expressed support for Marcos' stance, which could drag the U.S. and China into conflict. Chinese representatives at the dialogue questioned the Philippines' actions, suggesting they threaten regional peace.\n\nOverall, the article portrays the Philippines as a destabilizing force in the region, influenced by U.S. interests, and calls for a return to dialogue and negotiation to resolve disputes."

        "body": "环球时报记者现场感受\"香会\"的\"两面性\"：既用中国\"吸睛\"，又为中国\"设套\"\n\n【环球时报赴新加坡特派记者 郭媛丹】6月2日上午，当中国国防部长董军在第21届香格里拉对话会（以下简称\"香会\"）上作大会发言时，新加坡香格里拉酒店会场内座无虚席。专程报道\"香会\"的《环球时报》记者观察到，中国防长发言环节结束后不久，在酒店大堂内拉着行李箱办退房手续的人陆续多了起来。一位多次参加\"香会\"的外媒同行表示，美国防长发言被安排在1日，中国防长发言在2日，\"大会议程之所以将两国防长发言分别放在两天，就是为了有看点，防止参会人员半途离会\"。不过，\"香会\"主办方一方面靠中方代表团\"撑场面\"，另一方面却在会议日程设计、演讲嘉宾安排上处处为中国\"设套\"、\"挖坑\"。接受记者采访的专家认为，中国解放军代表团参加\"香会\"是努力在不同中寻找相同，在不确定性中寻找确定性，而有些国家则是在相同中找不同，蓄意挑事。\n\n马科斯歪曲渲染海上事态，奥斯汀发言给予支持\n\n\"香会\"由英国智库国际战略研究所（IISS）主办，是目前亚太地区安全对话机制中规模最大、规格最高的多边会议之一，也被称为\"亚洲安全峰会\"。按照议程设置，大会有3场重头戏：开幕晚宴上一位国家领导人发言、第二天美国防长发言、第三天中国防长发言。今年3月，IISS就在其官网上宣布菲律宾总统马科斯将出席\"香会\"，并在开幕晚宴上作主旨发言，这是3位重量级嘉宾中最早确定下来的一位，也是\"香会\"首次邀请菲律宾总统发表主旨演讲。\n\n新加坡《联合早报》此前报道称：\"南海紧张局势预计会是区域国家'舌战'的主轴。菲律宾可能会在美国和其他一些国家的撑腰下把矛头对准中国，中国面对的压力会比往年更大。\"\n\n果不其然，马科斯的发言大谈南海问题，并声称菲律宾的主权和管辖权继续受到\"非法、胁迫、侵略和欺骗行为\"的侵犯。对菲方有关表态罔顾历史和事实，宣扬其涉海错误立场，歪曲渲染海上事态，中国外交部已阐明中方立场，并敦促菲方重信守诺，立即停止海上侵权挑衅，尽快回到通过对话协商妥善处理海上矛盾分歧的正确轨道上来。\n\n多位参与\"香会\"的中外人士认为，\"香会\"作为亚太地区防务论坛，却展示出深深的美国五角大楼印记。比如美国防长奥斯汀在第二天的发言中就对马科斯的言论给予支持，并表示每个国家，无论大小，都有权享有自己的海洋资源。他还声称，菲律宾\"所面临的骚扰是危险的\"，确保南海保持\"自由开放\"符合共同利益。在提问环节，奥斯汀也强调了《美菲共同防御条约》\"坚定如铁\"。\n\n除此之外，今年\"香会\"的一个临时性安排，也能反映出美国对此次大会的影响。在奥斯汀发言结束之后，IISS便宣布乌克兰总统泽连斯基将出席\"香会\"并发言。《环球时报》记者在现场发现，在2日中午泽连斯基发言之际，奥斯汀提前在会场门口等候，与泽连斯基一同进入会场，这一举动像是在有意传递出美国支持乌克兰的信号。\n\n参会的解放军代表团成员潘庆华2日在新加坡对《环球时报》记者表示，无论是欢迎晚宴上马科斯演讲，还是第一次全体会议上奥斯汀演讲，包括一些政治人物的临时出席，种种\"巧合性\"安排，容易让人们认为，\"IISS试图在议题设置上制造围堵中国的话题，其议程安排也可能是出于抵消中国军队声音对外传播的考量\"。\n\n不仅如此，IISS公布的演讲名单中共有42位嘉宾，《环球时报》记者一一核对后发现，其中一半来自亚洲地区，而近2/3的发言者来自美国或美国盟友。除了东盟国家，出席会议的很多高级代表团也都是来自美国在亚太和北约的盟友。\n\n解放军代表团成员、军事科学院战争研究院研究员曹延中在新加坡接受《环球时报》记者采访时表示，美国的北约盟友\"千里迢迢\"来到新加坡发表所谓\"对亚太安全的看法\"，是在配合美国把更多对立、对抗带到会场上来。比如东欧国家立陶宛的代表在发言中表示，该国出台了一个所谓的\"印太战略\"，这是在\"不加掩饰地随美起舞\"。\n\n曹延中说：\"从一系列细节中可以看出，主办方提供了一个舞台，围绕所谓'基于规则的国际秩序'，通过各国代表团发言及舆论配合渲染所谓'中国威胁'。\"\n\n中国国防部新闻发言人一连回答17个问题\n\n\"香会\"的两面性还体现在舆论场上。参会中方代表团成员在香格里拉酒店一向是被世界媒体高度关注的，一方面，媒体希望从代表团那里获得尽可能多的信息，但另一方面一些西方媒体会进行倾向性报道，刻意放大中方代表团的一些表态，又无视中国真正对外传递的热爱和平、命运与共的理念。\n\n\"塔楼翼1006\"是今年\"香会\"期间中方代表团的临时\"发布厅\"。在\"香会\"期间，中方代表团共举行了4次记者会，发布人有国防部新闻发言人、官员以及专家学者，最大可能地满足了媒体的诉求。比如第一场记者会的主题是关于中美防长会谈，主持人是国防部新闻发言人吴谦。而最后一次与记者见面的则是代表团的军事专家们，记者注意到他们的行李箱就放在走廊上，专家们接受完媒体采访就离开酒店。\n\n在中美防长会谈的现场，美方工作人员明确表示，会谈后美方不会召开吹风会，只会发布一则新闻简讯。而相比较之下，在中美防长会谈结束15分钟之后，吴谦就出现在香格里拉酒店的临时\"发布厅\"，迎接他的是来自法新社、美国《纽约时报》、英国《金融时报》等几十家媒体的记者，后来的记者都只能席地而坐。在介绍完中美防长会谈的基本情况后，吴谦总共回应了17个提问，直至没有记者再举手提问。\n\n这17个问题内容十分丰富，比如追问中美防长会谈究竟谈出了什么新成果，双方在规避风险时有没有达成新的准则等等。吴谦也说明了自己的身份和职能范围，表示并不能准确回应所有问题，但依旧对记者们的疑问给出了个人的观点。比如在回应\"中美两国在哪些方面还可以增强合作\"这一问题时，吴谦表示，中美两军之间有着很多的共同利益，但也确实存在分歧。双方需要积累互信，并且不断扩大互信，因此双方可以从一些不太敏感的领域先做起来，比如军事院校的沟通交流。\n\n会后，有数位与《环球时报》记者相熟的外媒记者表示，发布会非常不错，能感受到发言人非常积极地解答媒体的提问，\"这是一个与中国解放军代表团深入沟通的机会，比较难得\"。\n\n\"短期内'西强我弱'的舆论格局还难以改变，国际舆论场上美西方声音大一些、多一些，这是客观现实。但我们也可以明显感受到，中国军队的声音正在自然注入国际舆论场，我们的声音越来越被听见、被重视、被接受。\"潘庆华举例说，会议期间他们几次通知媒体开吹风会，多家媒体因为之前没抢到位置，提前四五十分钟就来抢位占座，这表明媒体是十分关注中国声音的。\n\n还有一个细节体现出记者在会上遭遇不公平对待。在主办方发布的美国代表团名单中包括很多家媒体，在与其中一家媒体的记者聊天时，《环球时报》记者发现中美记者的证件不同，对方享有更多的权限，而这位记者并没有额外做过申请，是主办方主动为他们升级的。这位记者坦言：\"这的确不公平。\"\n\n潘庆华认为，尽管\"香会\"是西方国家的主场，但我们愿意借助这个平台，把一个全面、立体、真实的中国军队介绍给世界。事实上，长期以来中国军队为国际社会提供了大量国际公共安全产品，比如国际维和、远洋护航等。\"我们做了很多维护世界和平的事情，不应该被随意贴上负面标签，我们有责任向世界讲清楚我们的国防政策和理念主张，这也是中国军队应邀参会的一个重要原因。我们在共建人类命运共同体理念的指导下，致力于推动亚太地区的安全与发展，努力在不同中寻找相同，在不确定性中寻求确定性。\"\n\n会场上的\"大国效应\"：中美防长发言最受关注\n\n参加\"香会\"的人都会注意到一个现象：在两天的正式会议期间，只有美国和中国两个国家防长讲话时听众会给予高度热情，无论是会场内还是媒体室都会出现\"一座难求\"的场景。相较之下，其他发言嘉宾的听众明显少很多，有媒体将这种现象形容为\"大国效应\"。\n\n已经第三次参加\"香会\"的曹延中告诉《环球时报》记者，参会最深刻的感受是，一些西方国家一方面要中国承担大国责任，另一方面又觉得中国作为大国，对其造成潜在威胁，处处要对中国进行围堵和抵制。他说：\"作为美西方主导的国际话语平台，主办方刻意'设套'，想方设法把各种议题引向中国，包括南海、台海问题，似乎一切问题都出在中国身上。而对美国，会场上几乎听不到什么批评声。这就是国际话语权斗争的现实。\"\n\n在这背后，其实是美国并没有做好心理准备接受中国已经成为一个大国的现实。以中方学者身份参加\"香会\"的清华大学战略与安全研究中心研究员周波对《环球时报》记者表示：\"面对中国快速发展并成为世界第二大经济体，美国精英阶层是无法接受的，这也是美国从战略上对中国进行打压的根本原因。\"\n\n奥斯汀宣称：\"只有亚洲安全，美国才能安全。\"他还强调美国坚定致力于维护印太地区安全的承诺，但这种承诺需要借助美国在印太地区的盟友和伙伴关系的力量。周波表示：\"目前美国的精力被牵制在欧洲和中东战场，因此其支持马科斯在南海滋事挑衅，又在台湾问题上'切香肠'，以此遏制中国发展。\"周波补充道：\"在关键问题上美国人还是想得明白的，美国绝对不想和中国爆发战争。\"\n\n针对菲律宾挑起与中国的争端，周波表示，\"两个国家一旦产生争端，由于人们天生同情弱者，大国实际上会处于不利地位。当前国际社会被菲律宾的'卖惨'遮蔽了双眼。但真相是，在历史上动过手的国家是菲律宾，数次杀伤中国大陆和台湾地区的渔民。\"\n\n曹延中说，无论是台海问题还是南海问题，都是历史遗留问题。中国对南海的主张由来已久，并不是中国发展壮大后才有的。中国奉行防御性的国防政策，既没有扩张的动机，也没有扩张的打算，东盟国家可以充分感受到这一点。\n\n印尼当选总统普拉博沃在1日的发言中表示，印尼奉行不结盟政策，尽可能与所有国家维持良好关系，他引述\"远亲不如近邻\"的道理，说明真正的地区安全来自与邻国的良好关系。\n\n作为中国国防部国际军事合作办公室安全合作中心前主任，周波经常接受英国广播公司、彭博社等知名国际媒体的采访。他告诉《环球时报》记者：\"中西方媒体关注问题的角度并不相同，这是源于双方在认知、历史文化背景等因素上的差异。因为意识形态不同以及对中国先入为主的刻板印象，西方媒体的问题会带有明显的倾向性。但与西方媒体积极主动地沟通是讲述中国故事的机会，听众会有自己的判断。\"\n\n2日晚间，记者再度踏入香格里拉酒店，安保设施、\"香会\"的宣传牌等已全部被撤走，大堂内安静、冷清，与大会期间的人声鼎沸似乎是两个世界。褪去政治场上的争论，无论是西方还是东方，没有人想要战争，和平才是最大的渴望，幸福生活才是最大的追求。在对这个目标的追求之路上，中国和世界彼此需要。争议方与其相互争论、制造矛盾，不如坐下来谈话，用务实的态度共同解决问题。",

        "summary": "The article from Global Times covers the dual nature of the Shangri-La Dialogue (SLD), an important security forum in the Asia-Pacific region. The event, held in Singapore, featured speeches from key figures including Chinese Defense Minister Li Shangfu, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, and Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.\n\nKey points include:\n\n1. **Event Structure and Key Figures**: The SLD is organized by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) and is a major platform for discussing regional security. This year, the event featured speeches from Marcos, Austin, and Li on different days to maintain audience interest.\n\n2. **Contentious Issues**: Marcos criticized China's actions in the South China Sea, which was supported by Austin. Austin emphasized the importance of maritime rights and the U.S.-Philippines defense treaty. The forum also saw the unexpected participation of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, signaling U.S. support for Ukraine.\n\n3. **Perceived Bias**: The article suggests that the SLD's agenda and speaker arrangements were designed to challenge China, with a significant presence of U.S. and allied representatives. Chinese experts and military officials felt that the forum was used to amplify anti-China rhetoric.\n\n4. **Chinese Participation**: Despite the perceived bias, the Chinese delegation actively engaged with the media, holding multiple press conferences to present China's perspective. Chinese officials emphasized their commitment to peace and regional stability.\n\n5. **Media Dynamics**: The article highlights the disparity in media treatment, with Western journalists receiving preferential access. However, Chinese representatives noted increased international interest in China's viewpoints.\n\n6. **Broader Implications**: The discussions at the SLD reflect broader geopolitical tensions, particularly between the U.S. and China. The article underscores the need for dialogue and cooperation to address regional security issues and avoid conflict.\n\nIn summary, the SLD showcased significant geopolitical tensions, particularly around the South China Sea, with the U.S. and its allies challenging China's actions. Despite perceived biases, China used the platform to advocate for its positions and call for peaceful resolutions to disputes."

        "body": "环球时报报道，近日，中国海上执法部门对仁爱礁附近海域进行常态化巡逻，并对仁爱礁周边的漂浮物和不可回收垃圾进行清理。中国海警局对此表示称，中国对仁爱礁在内的南沙群岛拥有无可争辩的主权，中国海上执法部门将积极保护海洋环境。并将进一步在南海开展垃圾清理工作。\n\n过去菲律宾一直试图通过国际舆论抹黑中国，称中国在南海破坏珊瑚礁，破坏海洋生态环境，可能导致南海渔业资源减少，甚至公然造谣中国在南海\"投毒\"，就是为了让菲律宾的渔民不到南海进行捕鱼，以达到对南海岛礁实际控制的目的。然而中国海警在仁爱礁附近海域进行垃圾清理工作，发现不少来自菲律宾的饮料瓶。\n\n这也说明，菲律宾挑起的海洋环境问题，本质上只不过是菲律宾用来吸引国际舆论关注的一种手段，其想让南海区域争端问题上升成为全球热点问题，并以此引发域外势力的关注和介入。菲律宾将自身塑造成一个\"国际环保人士\"的角色，将中国污蔑为南海环境问题的制造者，给国际社会造成一种中国\"以大欺小\"的错觉，为菲律宾进一步加紧对南海岛礁的非法主权声索创造国际舆论条件。但实际上，真正在破坏仁爱礁等南海岛礁生态的恰恰是菲律宾自己。\n\n中国海警船\n\n另外在新加坡举行的第21届香格里拉峰会开幕式上，菲律宾总统小马科斯就出席发表了演讲。小马科斯在演讲中对南海问题大书特书，恨不得让全世界都认为中国是南海问题的始作俑者。\n\n而且小马科斯还继承美国那一套逻辑，大谈所谓基于\"规则\"的国际秩序，指责\"邻国\"在南海违反规则，刻意将中国塑造成一个\"霸凌者\"的角色，将菲律宾描绘为一个\"受害者\"的形象。除此之外，马科斯还拿出菲律宾对南海的法律依据，甚至不惜拿出菲律宾的国内法以及根本没有任何效力的《南海仲裁案》说事。\n\n可实际上，违反规则的恰恰是菲律宾自己。中国外交部此前就多次回应称，中国对南海拥有不可争辩的主权，中国也对相关海域拥有主权和管辖权。中国是最早发现南海岛礁并且对其命名开发的国家，中国理应拥有对南海的主权和管辖权。\n\n而国际法上菲律宾的领土范围，根本就不包括南沙群岛。菲律宾的主权划分范围主要有三份国际法依据，分别是1898年《美西和平条约》、1900年《美西关于菲律宾外围岛屿割让的条约》、1930年《关于划定英属北婆罗洲与美属菲律宾之间的边界条约》。\n\n这三份国际法条约，明确对菲律宾的领土范围做出了规定，而这些国际法规定的菲律宾领土，并不包括我黄岩岛、仁爱礁在内的南海岛礁。\n\n现在菲律宾提出的对我国南海岛礁的非法主权声索，实际上都是基于菲律宾国内通过的《群岛基线法案》，这一法案是菲国内法，对国际纷争并没有约束力，菲律宾更不能以国内法作为依据，对其他国家的领土提出非法主权声索。除此之外，所谓的《南海仲裁案》，本身就违反了国际法。《南海各方行为宣言》明确规定，此仲裁侵犯了中国作为《联合国海洋法公约》缔约国的权利。\n\n我国防部长董军\n\n这些都说明，菲律宾才是那个破坏基于\"规则\"的国际秩序的国家。这2年，在美国支持下，菲律宾屡次在南海地区挑衅中国，还颠倒黑白的说我们是\"破坏规则\"，要维护基于\"规则\"的国际秩序，这就像贼喊捉贼，怎么听怎么可笑。\n\n对此，我国防部长董军在香格里拉对话上发表主旨演讲时就明确表示，现在的南海局势总体稳定，中国在在南海问题上始终保持着足够克制的态度，但这种克制是有限度的。希望有关国家认清利害关系，回到对话和沟通的方式解决南海岛礁争端问题上来。\n\n董军的这一表态，无疑是对菲律宾的警告。中国海上执法部门在仁爱礁海域清理海上垃圾，那么同样也可以清理菲律宾在仁爱礁制造的其他垃圾。\n\n菲律宾总统小马科斯\n\n如果菲律宾方面不听劝，继续在南海问题上继续肆意妄为，那么我们不排除会把\"坐滩\"在仁爱礁上的那一艘\"垃圾\"给拖走。毕竟不论是船上驻守人员，每天产生的垃圾在往海上排泄，同时破舰锈蚀所掉落的物件也是对海洋生态的重大破坏，所以既然是清理垃圾，那么这一最大的垃圾显然不应该放过。\n\n最后，目前情况来看，美国及其盟友为菲律宾撑腰的大背景下，如果一昧地和菲律宾讲道理，只会换来得寸进尺，还不如打得一拳开，免得百拳来。既然菲律宾听不懂好言相劝，那就得用他们听得懂的方式劝说。返回搜狐，查看更多",

        "summary": "The article from Global Times reports on recent actions and statements by China regarding the South China Sea dispute with the Philippines. Key points include:\n\n1. **Chinese Patrols and Environmental Efforts**: Chinese maritime law enforcement has been conducting regular patrols and cleaning up debris around Ren'ai Reef, asserting China's indisputable sovereignty over the Spratly Islands and its commitment to protecting the marine environment.\n\n2. **Philippine Accusations**: The Philippines has accused China of damaging coral reefs and the marine ecosystem in the South China Sea, allegedly to deter Filipino fishermen and assert control over the area. However, Chinese patrols found debris, including beverage bottles, originating from the Philippines, suggesting that the environmental issues are being used by the Philippines to attract international attention and intervention.\n\n3. **Philippine President's Speech**: At the 21st Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. criticized China, portraying the Philippines as a victim and China as a bully violating international rules. He cited Philippine domestic laws and the South China Sea Arbitration as legal bases for their claims, which China rejects.\n\n4. **Chinese Response**: Chinese Defense Minister Li Shangfu emphasized that China maintains restraint in the South China Sea but warned that this restraint has limits. He urged relevant countries to resolve disputes through dialogue and communication. Li also hinted that China might take further actions, such as removing the grounded Philippine vessel at Ren'ai Reef, if provocations continue.\n\n5. **International Context**: The article suggests that the Philippines, backed by the U.S. and its allies, is escalating tensions. It argues that the Philippines' actions are hypocritical and that China might need to take a firmer stance to prevent further provocations.\n\nIn summary, the article highlights ongoing tensions between China and the Philippines over the South China Sea, with China asserting its sovereignty and accusing the Philippines of using environmental issues to garner international support. Chinese officials have warned of potential actions if provocations persist."

Recently, the Philippines has aligned with external powers, particularly the U.S., by expanding military bases under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, participating in trilateral summits with the U.S. and Japan, and conducting joint military exercises in the South China Sea. These actions have been viewed negatively by other ASEAN countries and have marginalized the Philippines in regional cooperation.\n\nThe article highlights that the previous Philippine administration maintained an independent foreign policy, emphasizing dialogue and negotiation, which led to strengthened economic and diplomatic ties with China. This approach brought tangible benefits to the Philippines, including economic development and infrastructure improvements.\n\nIn contrast, the current administration's confrontational stance has heightened tensions in the South China Sea, creating obstacles to peaceful resolution and potentially destabilizing ASEAN unity. The article warns that continued military alignment with the U.S. and its allies could pose serious risks to regional peace and stability.\n\nThe author, a deputy director of the Philippine \"Asian Century\" Strategic Studies Institute, urges the Philippine government to value regional independence and stability, and to prioritize the common interests of the Philippines and its neighbors. By returning to a path of friendly negotiation, the Philippines can reduce conflict risks, promote regional stability, and send a positive signal to the people of the region."

It criticizes the Philippines for aligning with external powers, particularly the United States, by expanding military bases and participating in joint military exercises, which has led to increased regional tensions and potential marginalization in regional cooperation.\n\nThe article highlights that the previous Philippine administration maintained an independent foreign policy, fostering cooperation and dialogue with China, which benefited the country's economic development. In contrast, the current administration's confrontational stance has exacerbated tensions and hindered peaceful resolution efforts.\n\nThe author, a deputy director of the Philippine \"Asian Century\" Strategic Studies Institute, urges the Philippine government to value regional stability and mutual interests, suggesting that a return to friendly negotiations with China would reduce conflict risks and send a positive signal to the region."

        "body": "【大纪元2024年06月04日讯】（大纪元记者秋生综合报导）美国国防部长劳埃德‧奥斯汀（Lloyd Austin）周二（6月4日）将前往柬埔寨，推动与该国重新建立关系。在美国试图与中共在东南亚最热心的盟友柬埔寨加强接触之际，美国对中柬的安全和经济关系不断加深，以及中共在柬埔寨扩建云朗海军基地一事感到担忧。\n\n据彭博社报导，两位不愿透露姓名的美国官员表示，奥斯汀此行将会见柬埔寨首相洪马奈（Hun Manet，又译洪马内）等高级官员。洪马奈毕业于美国西点军校和纽约大学，在其父洪森（Hun Sen）执政近四十年后，在去年8月接任首相一职，并继续依靠北京的基础设施项目来支撑柬埔寨的经济。\n\n美中在柬埔寨角力\n\n这是五角大楼首脑自2022年以来首次访问这个湄公河国家，此刻北京正在该国重新开发一个战略海军基地，导致美中紧张局势加剧。美国称，该基地将成为中共在印度 -- 太平洋地区的第一个海外据点，但柬埔寨一再否认这一指控，称任何永久性的外国存在都将违反柬埔寨宪法。\n\n一位美国官员称，奥斯汀的访问预计将有助于美国与柬埔寨就建立更紧密的防务关系展开对话。另一位美国官员称，美国仍然关注与中共有关的云壤（也译作\"云朗\"）海军基地（Ream Naval Base）以及人权问题。\n\n中共近年来积极拉拢柬埔寨，除了通过\"一带一路\"进行基础建设之外，也加强军事合作、展开联合军演，意图扩大自身在东南亚地区的影响力。\n\n金边王家大学（RUPP）国际研究与公共政策学院（Institute for International Studies and Public Policy，IISPP）东南亚研究中心（CSEAS）主任索文达‧波（Sovinda Po）认为，柬埔寨新政府现在将有机会改善与美国的关系。\n\n索文达‧波说，\"只要华盛顿不坚持要求我们放弃与中国的密切关系，柬埔寨就可以向美国靠拢。\"\n\n根据柬埔寨政府数据，在洪马奈的领导下，柬埔寨经济继续倚重北京，去年该国吸引的49.2亿美元外资固定资产中，中国占了三分之二。\n\n柬埔寨副首相兼外交与国际合作部大臣宋金达（Sok Chenda Sophea）上个月赴北京，在与中共外长王毅举行的会议上，要求中方为更多的经济特区投资。双方还讨论了加强防务合作的问题。\n\n中共在柬埔寨的军事存在\n\n在出席新加坡防务论坛\"香格里拉对话\"后，奥斯汀将出访柬埔寨。他在论坛上发表讲话，盛赞华盛顿正在与该地区各国加强各种合作伙伴关系，以对冲北京的威胁。尽管他告诉各国政治和国防领导人美中关系正在改善，但事实上，在台湾、贸易和南海争端等问题上两国之间的紧张局势一直存在。\n\n今年早些时候，中共军舰罕见地访问了柬埔寨位于泰国湾的云壤海军基地。上个月，柬埔寨与中共在该基地附近举行了为期15天的名为\"金龙2024\"（Golden Dragon 2024）的首次实弹联合演习，包括部署配备突击步枪的中国制造机器狗。美国对北京在柬埔寨的军事存在的担忧再次凸显。\n\n柬埔寨副首相兼国防大臣迪西哈（Tea Seiha）在奥斯汀上周末出席的\"香格里拉对话\"上声称，在云壤海军基地问题上没有什么可隐瞒的。\n\n责任编辑：李琳#",

Austin will meet with Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and other senior officials. This visit marks the first by a Pentagon chief to Cambodia since 2022, occurring as China redevelops a strategic naval base there, heightening U.S.-China tensions. The U.S. aims to foster closer defense ties with Cambodia, despite the latter's economic reliance on China. The visit follows Austin's participation in the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, where he emphasized U.S. partnerships in the region to counter Beijing's influence. Recent joint military exercises between China and Cambodia at the Ream Naval Base have further raised U.S. concerns."

        "body": "南海局势似乎已经到了剑拔弩张的程度，菲方向\"坐滩\"军舰上空投物资时，菲方居然有人拿枪指着中国海警。不仅如此，菲律宾总统在香格里拉对话上，当着中方的面，居然提到了\"开战\"二字，菲方之所以这么嚣张，主要是因为，他们认定了中方不会开火。\n\n环球网日前公开了一段菲方向\"马德雷山\"号军舰空投补给时的视频。根据视频内容，菲律宾空军一架小型飞机执行了一次超低空飞行任务，向该国在南海仁爱礁\"坐滩\"的军舰上的士兵们空投补给。\n\n值得一提的是，当时，中国海警人员就在附近执行执法任务，为了防止中方打断菲方的空投活动，菲律宾士兵竟然举枪瞄准中国海警人员，向中方发出直接威胁。所幸没有发生任何意外或者开火事件，但菲方此举，已经对中国海警构成了非常明显的挑衅。在中国的地盘上竟然还拿枪对着中方，简直太猖狂了。\n\n事实上，从现场画面看，中国海警人员在接近菲律宾士兵时，并没有携带任何武器，这在潜在危险的环境中显得有些不足。即便是出于自卫目的，适当的防卫措施和装备也是必要的，以便保障我方人员的安全与法律权益。但在这次事件中，中方表现出冷静克制的态度，将菲方的罪证保留了下来，更方便让外界看清菲方的真实面目。\n\n一直以来，在南海问题上，中国始终表现出相对的克制和人道主义态度，在没有使用武力的情况下，多次容忍并允许菲方向菲律宾军舰送去补给。这种宽容甚至可以被视作是对于国际海洋法则的尊重和对人道主义原则的践行。然而，菲方士兵公然用武器威胁中国海警人员的行为，这种克制的态度或许需要重新考量。\n\n值得一提的是，这件事是在菲律宾所谓的\"百船突袭\"黄岩岛仅仅四天后发生的，显示了菲律宾方面在区域内采取的双轨策略：一方面通过大张旗鼓的海上活动吸引国际社会的注意，另一方面则在其他区域进行更为隐蔽的行动。若不是中方及时曝光，外界恐怕根本就不知道菲律宾在仁爱礁附近的挑衅行为。\n\n【菲律宾总统马科斯在香会上给中方立规矩】\n\n不仅如此，菲律宾总统马科斯还口出狂言，居然当着中方的面，在南海问题上给中国立规矩。在此期间，马科斯还搬出了自己的靠山，一场简短的发言，居然公然提到美国11次，司马昭之心昭然若揭。\n\n除了提到美菲的《共同防御条约》之外，马科斯还向中方发难，他不仅点名批评中国，还提到了\"开战\"二字。马科斯给中方立规矩，要求中方不要跨越所谓的\"红线\"，若菲方有人能因此而丧生，那么这将被视为\"战争行为\"，菲方将做出相关回应。而作为盟友的美国，也会有所行动。\n\n菲方之所以这么强硬，一方面是认为，中方不敢轻易开火，另一方面，菲方可能高估了该国在地区角力中的筹码，对自己以及美国的实力盲目自信。菲律宾方面的挑衅行为，实际上可能是一种战略上的过度伸展，暴露出其对区域安全稳定负有责任的外交政策的缺失。\n\n【中方的克制，不是菲方挑衅的资本】\n\n在处理这类问题时，中方的策略始终是慎重的，既要坚定维护国家领土主权和海洋权益，同时也要避免不必要的冲突升级。如何巧妙地回应菲律宾的挑衅，确保地区和平与稳定，是对中国外交的一大考验。\n\n撇开武力不谈，通过多边论坛、外交谈判和国际法律途径等，加强与东南亚邻国的合作，推动南海行为准则的早日完成，可能是化解当前紧张局势、实现区域长治久安的更有效途径。返回搜狐，查看更多",

        "summary": "The South China Sea situation has escalated as Filipino soldiers pointed guns at Chinese coast guard personnel during an air drop of supplies to the grounded Philippine Navy ship, BRP Sierra Madre, on the Ren'ai Reef. This incident, captured on video, shows a Philippine aircraft conducting a low-altitude supply drop while Chinese coast guard officers were nearby on a law enforcement mission. Despite the provocation, no shots were fired, and the Chinese side maintained restraint.\n\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. further heightened tensions by mentioning the possibility of war during the Shangri-La Dialogue, criticizing China, and invoking the US-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty. Marcos's remarks and the aggressive stance of the Filipino soldiers suggest a strategy to draw international attention and leverage US support, potentially overestimating their position in regional dynamics.\n\nChina has historically shown restraint and humanitarian consideration in the South China Sea, allowing supply deliveries to the Philippine ship without using force. However, the recent provocations may prompt China to reassess its approach. The incident underscores the need for China to balance defending its territorial sovereignty with avoiding unnecessary conflict escalation. Diplomatic efforts, multilateral forums, and international legal avenues are suggested as more effective means to ensure long-term regional stability."

        "body": "5月31日到6月2日，香格里拉对话，一个包括亚太28国参加的国防安全对话会在新加坡举行，备受瞩目的两个大国的国防部长 -- -- 美国的奥斯汀和中国的董军面对面会晤。\n\n这是两国防长时隔一年半后的首次会晤。此前，奥斯汀曾经表达过与他对等的中国高级官员是中央军委副主席，而非国防部长。\n\n中美防长会晤后，分别发表主旨演讲。奥斯汀说，印太地区的国家如今在安全上有了新的融合，这会形成一个更强大、更有韧性、更有能力的伙伴关系网络。\n\n中方代表团则在一场记者会上表示，美国的印太战略真正目的是把一个个小圈子融合成亚太版的北约这个大圈子，从而维持以美国为主导的霸权地位。\n\n同时，菲律宾总统小马科斯、乌克兰总统泽连斯基都出席对话，台湾没有代表出席，但各方在南海问题、台湾问题、俄乌问题上言辞交锋，且都有涉及中国。\n\n不过中美双方也强调建立沟通机制的重要性。董军说，中美两军之间正因为有分歧更要多交流；奥斯汀说，他告诉董军，如果情况紧急致电，他会接听；同时希望董军也能如此。\n\n董军讲话中，台湾问题是重点。他表示，现在的问题是民进党当局大搞渐进式\"台独\"，顽固地推行去中国化，妄图割裂两岸的社会、历史、文化联系。\n\n董军还表示，外部干涉势力正在以切香肠的方式，不断地虚化掏空\"一个中国\"原则，炮制涉台法案，执意对台售武、非法进行官方往来，\"这实际上就是在助长'台独'，图谋以台制华，这些险恶用心，正在把台湾引向险境\"。\n\n\"谁胆敢把台湾从中国分裂出去，必将粉身碎骨、自取灭亡！\"\n\n对比去年香格里拉对话，时任中国国防部长李尚福的表述是，\"如果有人胆敢把台湾从中国分裂出去，中国军队不会有丝毫迟疑，不畏惧任何对手。\"\n\n对于董军的表述，台湾总统府发言人表示，中国在香格里拉对话曲解台湾政府的立场，甚至威胁动武，却长期透过政治施压，不允许台湾派代表在香格里拉对话表达意见，此举透露中国缺乏自信与台湾政府对话，其非理性的言论无法获得国际认同。\n\n过去一年，台湾经历大选，民进党打破政党轮替，其候选人赖清德当选，5月20日正式就职，3天后，中国突然进行围台军演。\n\n台湾国防部智库\"国防安全研究院\"钟志东博士此前向BBC中文表示，随着中国频繁使用灰色冲突的军事演习，其威摄效益正不断递减中，所以未来不排除北京采小规模军事攻击外岛目标，以加大其军事恫吓的力道。\n\n除台湾外，南海问题也是各方隔空交锋的重要话题。\n\n董军说，当前南中国海的局势总体稳定，这得益于地区国家的共同努力。\n\n话锋一转，他又表示，有个别国家在外部势力的煽动下，毁弃双边的约定，违背自身的承诺，有预谋地挑起事端，制造假象，误导视听，甚至不顾地区国家的整体利益，违反东盟宪章精神，配合外部势力在本地区部署中程导弹。\n\n董军批评，这严重破坏了地区的安全稳定，\"这样的做法，终将会引火烧身\"。\n\n董军所指的是，今年4月消息，美国陆军的\"堤丰武器系统\"（Typhon Weapons System）的中程能力陆基飞弹发射系统在菲律宾北部部署，这是这套新型陆基飞弹系统首次在\"第一岛链\"亮相，中程飞弹的射程可达两千公里以上，因此被认为可达中国东南沿海地带及敏感的南海及台湾海峡区域。\n\n董军继续称，中国对侵权挑衅行径保持了足够的克制，但这也是有限的，希望个别国家认清利害关系，回归对话协商的正道，同地区国家一道，把南中国海建设成和平、友谊、合作之海。\n\n菲律宾总统小马科斯则更为直接。在他的主旨演讲后的一场问答环节，一位代表提出了一个假设：中国的水炮杀死了一名菲律宾士兵。有人问他是否认为这是一条红线，是否会援引美菲条约。\n\n小马科斯回答，\"如果菲律宾人 -- -- 不仅是军人，甚至是菲律宾公民 -- -- 被蓄意行为杀害......我认为这非常非常接近我们定义的战争行为，因此我们会做出相应的反应。我相信，我们的条约伙伴也持同样的标准。\"\n\n他指出，菲律宾人在最近的冲突中受伤，但还没有人丧生。\"一旦到了那一步，我们肯定就越过了卢比孔河。那是一条红线吗？几乎可以肯定，那将是一条红线。\"\n\n小马科斯所说的条约伙伴是指美国。1951年，两国签订《美菲共同防御条约》规定美菲在太平洋海域若领土及军队、船舶或飞机受到武装攻击，两国将采取共同军事行动应对。\n\n在会场，中国军方发言人在接受BBC采访时说，\"如果只有一个人在意外或冲突中丧生，就会引发战争，那么我真的认为这是一个好战的国家。\"\n\n他还对小马科斯在演讲中批评中国宣示主权的举动提出异议，并指责菲律宾\"将责任转嫁给中国\"。\n\n美国防长奥斯汀也就此回应，他一方面说，《美菲共同防御条约》\"坚定如铁（ironclad），没有疑问，没有例外\"；另一方面称，不会揣测任何假设性情况，\"我们正在做的，以及我们会继续做的，是通过增加大国之间的对话，确保这样的事不会发生\"。\n\n路透社援引一位不愿透露姓名的美国官员说，董军的讲话几乎没有涉及新的内容，\"三年来，每年都有新的中国国防部长来到香格里拉。每年，他们的演讲都与解放军在该地区的胁迫活动的现实完全不符。今年也不例外。\"\n\n乌克兰总统泽连斯基的名字并未出现在事先公布的会议议程中，但他还是出人意料地在上周日出现在新加坡。\n\n泽连斯基演讲称，希望争取亚洲国家领导人参加全球和平峰会。\n\n全球和平峰会由乌克兰倡议，6月15日至16日在瑞士举行，泽连斯基称目前已经有106个国家和国际组织同意参加这一会议。\n\n董军在新加坡对俄乌问题着墨不多。他表示，中国不会向俄乌战争任何一方提供武器，会严格管控军民两用物资出口。\n\n\"在乌克兰危机上，中方始终以负责任的态度，致力于劝和促谈，不向冲突任何一方提供武器，严格管控军民两用物资物项的出口。\"\n\n他还说，\"我们绝不干递刀拱火的事，坚定地站在和平一边，站在对话一边。\"\n\n几周前，习近平在访问欧洲时表示，他支持召开由俄罗斯和乌克兰参与的国际和平会议，当时他似乎对瑞士将于6月16日组织的和平会议持冷淡态度。\n\n莫斯科方面并未获邀请参加该会议。此后中国外交部曾表示，会议应该得到俄罗斯和乌克兰的承认，并且平等参与。否则，会议难以在恢复和平方面发挥实质性作用。\n\n泽连斯基先批评俄罗斯对峰会的破坏 -- -- \"俄罗斯正试图通过威胁封锁农产品、化学产品和能源，向各国施压，使其不参加峰会，从而破坏峰会。\"\n\n在随后的记者会上，他也点名了中国 -- -- 俄罗斯正在利用\"中国在该地区的影响力\"和外交官，\"竭尽全力破坏和平峰会\"。\n\n\"像中国这样一个独立、强大的大国成为普京手中的工具，这是不幸的\"。",

        "summary": "The Shangri-La Dialogue, a defense and security forum involving 28 Asia-Pacific countries, took place in Singapore from May 31 to June 2. Key highlights included the first face-to-face meeting in 18 months between U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chinese Defense Minister Li Shangfu. Both delivered speeches emphasizing regional security and the importance of communication mechanisms.\n\nKey issues discussed were the South China Sea, Taiwan, and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, with significant focus on China's role. Austin highlighted the integration of Indo-Pacific countries into a resilient security network, while the Chinese delegation criticized the U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy as an attempt to maintain hegemony.\n\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also attended. Marcos warned of potential conflict if Filipino lives were lost due to Chinese actions in the South China Sea, referencing the U.S.-Philippines defense treaty. Zelensky sought support for a global peace summit, criticizing Russia and indirectly China for undermining it.\n\nChina reiterated its stance on Taiwan, condemning external interference and warning against Taiwan independence. The South China Sea dispute saw China accusing certain countries of violating agreements and destabilizing the region with external support, specifically referencing U.S. missile deployments in the Philippines.\n\nOverall, the dialogue underscored ongoing tensions and the critical need for diplomatic engagement to manage regional security challenges."

        "body": "菲律宾又来碰瓷，炒作南海议题，甚至持枪指向中国海警，面对菲律宾一而再再而三的挑衅，中方不再忍耐。\n\n菲军动枪，中国防长表态\n\n香会召开期间，中方公布现场视频，菲律宾非法\"坐滩\"在仁爱礁的军舰上的人员用手枪指向中国海警。\n\n据悉，当时，\"马德雷拉\"号舰上至少有两名菲军人员持枪在甲板上活动，并且在注意到中国海警的活动时，采取了用手和枪指向中国海警的动作，表现出明显的恐吓意图。\n\n仁爱礁是中国固有领土，在中国领土上，菲律宾枪指中国海警，既是挑衅，也是威胁。\n\n对此，中方重申了对仁爱礁及其附近海域拥有无可争辩的主权，并强调尽管保持克制，不过这种克制是有限度的。\n\n此外，在新加坡参会的中国防长董军得知后，就南海问题明确表示，中方当前对南海挑衅行为已经足够克制，希望个别国家认清利害、回归正道。但如果局势升级，中方将会采取必要措施捍卫自身的主权和安全利益。\n\n毫无疑问，这是中方给菲律宾的警告，也是在劝菲方不要肆意消耗中方的好意。\n\n自菲律宾总统小马科斯上任以来，中方对菲律宾的善意，被菲方认为是软弱，菲律宾不光自己在南海挑衅中方主权，还拉拢外部势力美国等介入南海问题。\n\n中国海警已经在黄岩岛实现常态化巡航，且根据中国海警的新规，中方海警可以逮捕非法入国境的外国人。\n\n这条措施显示是针对菲律宾，如果菲律宾敢派军人或渔民来中方海域，如黄岩岛和仁爱礁，那么中方有权对其进行逮捕，逮捕后，中方将依法对其审查，最长可关押60天的时间。\n\n中方这么做，无疑给菲律宾在南海的行动的立下了规矩，之后，菲律宾不管是自己闯南海还是拉拢域外势力闯南海，中国海警都有法可依，依法严办。\n\n而菲律宾在明知有该律令的情况下，依然枪指中国海警，中国海警不得不采取更强硬的措施。\n\n事发24小时后，中方发布清除仁爱礁垃圾的视频。\n\n我们都知道，菲律宾非法坐滩军舰在仁爱礁非法搁浅25年之久，对仁爱礁及其周围海洋生态环境造成了重大破坏。\n\n\"马德雷山号\"源自二战时期，由于长期\"坐滩\"，船体严重受损且无法移动，导致其对周边海洋环境造成了持续的污染。专家警告，该舰可能对海洋生物造成长期且不可逆的伤害，成为南海的一个\"污点\"。\n\n菲律宾国防部曾承认\"马德雷山号\"的状况正在迅速恶化，存在大洞，面临彻底解体的风险。如果舰船最终解体，菲律宾可能不得不从仁爱礁撤出驻军。\n\n此外，菲律宾军警将排泄物全部倾倒在潟湖内，并将定期焚烧后的垃圾排入海洋，中方看了，深感心痛。\n\n如今，中国海警着手清理垃圾，很有可能意味着菲律宾的坐滩军舰被中国海警拖走，届时，菲律宾便失去了在仁爱礁继续搁浅的理由。\n\n南海问题，中方仍希望菲律宾走上正路\n\n其实，仁爱礁的坐滩军舰早该被移除，中方拖到现在，是因为还对菲律宾抱有忍耐力。\n\n从去年八月份仁爱礁的事件开始，菲律宾的动作接连不断，时而是大规模舰队向黄岩岛进发，时而是对\"中国海警使用水炮、武力\"事件的夸大报道。\n\n碍于中菲是近邻的关系，中国却为菲律宾提供了回旋余地，耐心劝导，同时，中方对南海权益的主张，并非独有，而是共享。\n\n可以说，在南海问题上，中国对菲律宾已经是仁至义尽。\n\n拿中菲仁爱礁争端为例，中国若果断行动，有能力在仁爱礁对菲律宾封锁，让菲律宾生活必需品无法运送到\"马德雷山\"号上，如此一来，破船上的菲军将在不到一个月内因缺水缺粮而面临生命危机，届时他们无疑无力再对中国海警持枪威胁。\n\n倘若中国海警决定不再保持克制，完全可以采取直接撞击的办法，面对中国海警的大型坚固船只，菲律宾的破船根本承受不起一击。\n\n可以说，拿回被菲律宾侵占的南海区域，对解放军来说易如反掌。\n\n菲律宾如果还执迷不悟，在仁爱礁上和中方起冲突，别怪中方不再忍耐，历史终将证明，中国过去、未来都是南海真正的主人。返回搜狐，查看更多",

Chinese Defense Minister Li Shangfu reiterated China's indisputable sovereignty over Ren'ai Reef and warned that China would take necessary measures to defend its sovereignty if the situation escalates.\n\nThe incident highlights ongoing provocations by the Philippines, which has been emboldened by external support, particularly from the United States. China has implemented measures allowing its coast guard to arrest foreigners illegally entering its territory, signaling a stricter stance against such provocations.\n\nAdditionally, China has started cleaning up environmental damage caused by the long-standing presence of the \"Sierra Madre\" ship, which has been polluting the area for 25 years. This move could lead to the removal of the ship, undermining the Philippines' justification for its presence at Ren'ai Reef.\n\nChina continues to urge the Philippines to adopt a more cooperative approach to the South China Sea disputes, emphasizing that China's patience has limits and it will act decisively to protect its interests if necessary."

        "body": "局势持续升级！短短几天时间内，菲律宾在南海四处\"点火\"，侵闯中国岛礁。而这似乎只是开始，马科斯政府还有更大的野心。\n\n前言：\n\n如今的菲律宾俨然已经成为了美国在南海的\"反华急先锋\"。在本次香格里拉对话会上，菲总统马科斯在演讲中8次提到美国，一再渲染美国的存在对东南亚地区的重要作用，话里话外都将其当做了应对中国的\"靠山\"。\n\n现在看来，菲律宾已经变成了美国地缘战略的\"托\"，无论是对于菲律宾自身，还是南海稳定来说都不是一件好事。\n\n1.炒作中国填海造陆后，菲律宾獠牙露出来了\n\n前段时间，菲律宾海岸警卫队炒作中国在仙宾礁填海造陆。中国外交部发言人直接回怼，菲方的指责纯属造谣。\n\n事实上，这种无中生有的戏码上演了太多次，抹黑中国，误导国际社会只是最表面的原因。如今一则消息的曝光可谓是揭开了马科斯政府的险恶用心。\n\n据环球时报报道，菲律宾以中国\"填海造陆\"为借口，派遣巡逻船在仙宾礁潟湖内停留了超过40天之久，实际上是想借此形成对仙宾礁的军事化\"坐滩\"。\n\n这两艘菲律宾巡逻船长时间维持不动的场景，不由得让人想到了仁爱礁上非法坐滩的军舰。菲律宾现在显然是打算故技重施，在仙宾礁复刻与仁爱礁相同的场景。\n\n值得一提的是，这两艘巡逻船具备完整的通讯、侦察和直升机起降等能力，马科斯政府显然是想将其当成军事前哨，在必要时刻与中国海警\"硬碰硬\"。\n\n中国没有采取行动，反而是菲律宾以此为借口妄图控制仙宾礁，实现南海军事化。是可忍孰不可忍，包括仙宾礁在内的南沙群岛是中国的固有领土，菲律宾的举动显然触及了中方底线，接下来势必将遭到中方的强力回击。\n\n有分析称，仙宾礁的斗争已经发生质变，原本只是中国海警拦截菲船只，现在菲律宾的举动进一步升级，双方爆发冲突的可能性越来越大，南海局势或将出现新的升级。\n\n2.菲律宾举动愈发嚣张，南海出现危险一幕\n\n菲律宾的挑衅行动愈发激烈，想尽办法逼中国先动手，这样一来美国就有了插手的借口。\n\n除了菲律宾巡逻船长时间滞留在仙宾礁周围，仁爱礁非法滞留在\"马德雷山\"号上的菲军人更是直接将枪对准了中国海警。\n\n可以说，这是一个性质非常严重的动作，表明菲律宾军人很有可能对中国海警开火，即便中方舰艇的实力更强悍，但也不能掉以轻心。从种种迹象来看，菲律宾的挑衅行动正不断升级，甚至可以说是不计后果。\n\n菲律宾敢这么嚣张，自然是因为他们认为背后有美国撑腰，但不少明白人早就看到了菲律宾过度依赖美国潜藏的危机。菲律宾学者曾多次提醒称，马科斯政府的南海政策与其他东南亚国家出现了明显的不同，没有人愿意和菲律宾一样为美国冲锋陷阵，这也就导致了一个尴尬的局面，菲律宾在东盟国家中被孤立了。\n\n（CGTN公布视频展示菲方士兵用枪威胁我海警人员）\n\n除了菲律宾，其他东盟国家都很清楚，国家利益才是摆在第一位的，与中国的关系恶化并没有什么好处，美国画的大饼也不知道什么时候才能兑现，美国一旦插手南海问题，整个地区将永无宁日。\n\n如果有一天中国真的选择用军事手段解决南海问题，菲律宾将为此付出沉重的代价，远远不是马科斯能承担得起的，中方不止一次警告过菲律宾\"莫要逞强\"，但马科斯政府显然没有听进去。\n\n3.中国有必要先下手为强，两招粉碎菲企图\n\n现在的中国早已经不是以前的中国了，事关领土问题解放军更是不会后退一步。目前，解放军已经在南海布置了充足的军事力量，包括055万吨大驱、歼-11等军机，以及各种其他船舶。\n\n前段时间，有消息称，解放军出动无人机在多个方向对菲律宾进行了战略侦查。与此同时，中国也在不断搜集菲律宾破坏南海环境，威胁中方安全的种种证据。\n\n中国一直奉行先礼后兵，如果菲律宾一意孤行，解放军有的是手段，毕竟理在我们一方，无论采取什么行动，都是\"师出有名\"。\n\n菲律宾在南海\"耍赖皮\"，目的是为了得到美国更多的支持。军事专家分析称，中国可以采取两种方式应对。\n\n首先是高速拦截，菲律宾在仙宾礁潟湖内停留，一举一动都在中国海警和解放军的监视中，如果这些船只有再进一步的举动，中国舰艇可能会通过高速航行截断航线，建立\"铜墙铁壁\"，防止意外情况发生。\n\n其次是进行围困。如果局势进一步恶化，不排除中国海警采取\"强拖\"，或者强势驱离的方式。毕竟南沙群岛是中国的领土，在自己的领土内干什么都是合情合理的。有消息称，目前仙宾礁附近的中国船只越来越多，已经有几十艘船只现身，从数量来看，中方已占据绝对性的优势，包围菲律宾船只不是什么问题。\n\n接下来的局势如何发展，取决于菲律宾做出怎样的选择，虽然中方坚持通过平等协商解决分歧，但对于一味挑衅的行为绝不姑息。返回搜狐，查看更多",

        "summary": "The situation in the South China Sea is escalating as the Philippines has stationed two patrol ships at the Sabina Shoal for over 40 days, allegedly attempting to militarize the area. This move follows accusations from the Philippines that China is engaging in land reclamation at the shoal, which China has denied. The patrol ships are equipped with advanced capabilities, suggesting a strategic intent to establish a military presence.\n\nThe Philippines' actions are seen as provocative, potentially leading to increased conflict with China. The Philippines appears emboldened by its alliance with the United States, positioning itself as a key player in the region against China. However, this stance has isolated the Philippines within ASEAN, as other member countries prioritize their national interests and stable relations with China.\n\nChina has responded by increasing its military presence in the area and conducting strategic reconnaissance. Analysts suggest that China might take preemptive measures, such as intercepting or blockading the Philippine ships, to assert its territorial claims. The situation remains tense, with the potential for further escalation depending on the actions of both nations."

        "body": "一连三天在新加坡举行的香格里拉对话会已正式落下帷幕。与往届\"香会\"一样，中美防长在场边的互动备受外界关注。\n\n针对敏感议题的讨论，中国国防部长董军作出了哪些强势回应？\n\n5月31日下午，中国国防部长董军与美国国防部长奥斯汀举行了会晤。\n\n从会议画面可以看出，以奥斯汀为代表的美方人员西装革履，而中方代表团则统一身着军装。\n\n\"美国的国防部长他是文职，不是军职，所以在他退役若干年以后，再重新回到了国防部。虽然他是国防部长，但他没有军籍。\"\n\n中国国防部新闻发言人吴谦表示，整个会晤时长75分钟，稍微超出原定的60分钟，整体气氛不错，围绕中美两国两军关系、台湾问题、南海问题、乌克兰危机、巴以冲突等交换了意见。\n\n4月时董军和奥斯汀曾举行过线上会议，而这次线下会晤，也是自2022年11月以来，中美防长首次以面对面的形式举行会谈。\n\n军事专家 王云飞：\n\n\"视频会议它时间是有限的，很难进行深入的交流，这次交流董军部长对南海问题、台海问题表示了强烈的关切，这会让美国国防部长亲身感受到了东方坚定的意志和坚决的立场。\"\n\n这次是奥斯汀第三次以防长身份参加\"香会\"，但值得一提的是，这次会议是他\"带病上阵\"。\n\n会议前夕，美国国防部发布了一份关于奥斯汀健康状况的声明，称国防部长奥斯汀5月24日晚会前往医疗中心接受膀胱问题的微创治疗，但声明的末尾同时强调，奥斯汀的官方日程安排不会发生变化，会按照原计划出席今年的\"香会\"。\n\n\"即使生病他也得抓住这个机会，如果不抓住这个机会，那在世界各大国当中要实施美国的战略可能会遇到更多反对者，更多的难点。\"\n\n虽然美方口头上讲本着公开沟通的目的，但在中美防长会晤结束之后，美国国防部就发表了一条针对大陆近日围台军演的声明。\n\n在\"香会\"的最后一天，董军部长以\"中国的全球安全观\"为主题发表演讲，向\"台独\"势力发出最强烈、最明确的警告。\n\n到了演讲完毕的问答环节，当谈论到台湾问题时，主持人试图打断董军部长的发言，转移到中东和乌克兰的议题上，却遭到董军的霸气回应，称要先把台湾问题讲完，因为是我们的核心利益的核心问题。\n\n此次\"香会\"是董军就任中国防长后的首秀。1961年出生的董军，是山东烟台人，长期在海军机关工作。他曾担任海军司令部军训部部长、北海舰队副参谋长、东海舰队副司令员、海军司令员，后来晋升为海军上将。\n\n2023年12月29日，董军被任命为第14任中国国防部部长，成为首名海军出身的国防部长。\n\n\"中国当前的安全重点是在海上方向，台海、南海的安全，也包括在远海的安全，所以这时候选一个海军出身的领导当国防部长也是势在必行。\"\n\n4\n\n先前，中美两军之间的交往并不是十分顺畅。2022年8月，中美军事交流因时任美国众议院议长佩洛西窜访台湾而中断；直至2023年11月，中国国家主席习近平与美国总统拜登在旧金山举行了会晤后，双方才同意恢复两军高层沟通。\n\n但在5月20日，美国派员参加台湾地区新任领导人赖清德就职仪式并致贺，引发中方不满，随即进行大规模封岛军演，为刚刚转好一点的中美两军关系再度蒙上一层阴影。\n\n军事专家 王云飞：\n\n\"如果美方触犯了中国的核心利益，中美关系就一定会受到很大的影响。反过来，如果美方有所收敛，那么中美的关系就好一点，因为中美的军事关系也是两国关系的压舱石。\"\n\n台海风高浪急，中美\"香会\"针锋相对，那么美国和它的盟友最近在南海又有哪些动作呢？\n\n5月31日，菲律宾总统马科斯在\"香会\"现场被记者提问，若有菲方人员在中方的相关行动中丧命，菲律宾会如何反应。马科斯直言这或成为战争的导火索。无独有偶，第二天，美国国防部长奥斯汀也被问到了同样的问题，他表示《美菲共同防御条约》没有问题，是铁定的。\n\n而美国防长奥斯汀不但强调美国对印太地区格外重视，还提出南海\"航行自由\"的重要性。\n\n6月2日，菲律宾军舰非法\"坐滩\"仁爱礁的现场画面曝光，画面显示，菲方人员一度持枪指向中国海警。\n\n与美国亦步亦趋的菲律宾，在本届\"香会\"上，更是直接将矛头对准了中国。5月31日，菲律宾总统马科斯在\"香会\"开幕晚宴上进行了主旨发言，有备而来的他言语间锋芒毕露，剑指南海。\n\n军事专家 曹卫东：\n\n\"今年的美菲的联演不是在保护菲律宾的安全，而是超出了菲律宾的领海，在公共的海域上去打击别人。\"\n\n4月中旬，美国媒体称，美军新陆基飞弹系统\"堤丰\"系统已登陆菲律宾，该系统可装载\"战斧\"巡航导弹等，其火力半径可到达广州、上海、整个台海以及沿海解放军的军事基地。\n\n军事专家 曹卫东：\n\n\"这个导弹部署在了菲律宾的军事基地里，直接威胁菲律宾的邻居，直接破坏南海各国行为准则的框架协议。\"\n\n6\n\n今年5月，美菲在距台湾仅有45分钟航程的北伊罗戈省拉帕斯沙丘举行反登陆作战和击沉演习。对此，当地省长表达了不满和担忧，他直言这除了会给居民安危带来风险，还会影响中菲关系。\n\n而除了在菲律宾排兵布阵，美国又打起了新的算盘。\"香会\"刚结束，美国防长奥斯汀就马不停蹄地赶往柬埔寨。\n\n有分析指，奥斯汀此行是为了说服曾毕业于西点军校的\"校友\"柬埔寨首相洪玛奈，希望对方在外交上能与华盛顿趋同。\n\n近年来，中国在多个基础民生领域对柬埔寨展开了援助。除此之外，为加强柬埔寨海军维护海洋领土完整的能力，中国还援助柬埔寨云壤海军基地升级改造。然而，这却引起了美国的担忧。\n\n湖南师范大学外交研究中心主任 滕建群：\n\n\"美国本身在这个地区就有军事基地，特别是在菲律宾，甚至在新加坡还有一些临时租用的设施，而中国帮助柬埔寨援建一个基地就引起这么大的反响，美国似乎对于中国的一举一动都认为是对他的威胁，这是一种扭曲的认识。\"\n\n6月2日，中国国防部长董军坦言，南海原本是有利于区域经济发展的\"繁荣之海、和平之海\"，但却因为一些大国刻意强化军事存在，导致局势不断紧张升级。如何在湍流之中安全自处，已成为东盟国家不得不面对的挑战。\n\n军事专家 王云飞：\n\n\"马来西亚、印度尼西亚、越南等都在提醒菲律宾，你引入第三方的势力介入到地区间的纠纷，实际上对东盟以后长期的安全利益非常不利。\"",

        "summary": "The Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore concluded after three days, with significant attention on the interactions between Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. On May 31, Dong and Austin met for 75 minutes, discussing U.S.-China military relations, Taiwan, the South China Sea, the Ukraine crisis, and the Israel-Palestine conflict. This was their first in-person meeting since November 2022.\n\nDong Jun expressed strong concerns over the South China Sea and Taiwan issues, emphasizing China's firm stance. Despite Austin's health issues, he attended the dialogue, underscoring the importance of U.S. strategic interests. Following the meeting, the U.S. issued a statement on China's military exercises around Taiwan, which China viewed as provocative.\n\nDong Jun's speech at the dialogue warned against Taiwan independence and highlighted China's global security perspective. The dialogue marked Dong's debut as China's Defense Minister, a role he assumed in December 2023, becoming the first naval officer to hold the position.\n\nThe U.S. and Philippines' recent military activities in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait, including joint exercises and missile system deployments, have heightened tensions. The Philippines' President Marcos and Austin both emphasized their defense commitments, with Austin stressing the importance of freedom of navigation in the South China Sea.\n\nChina criticized these actions, arguing they destabilize the region. Dong Jun called for regional cooperation to maintain peace and prosperity, while experts noted the adverse effects of external military involvement on ASEAN's long-term security interests."

        "body": "為期三天的新加坡香格里拉對話周日閉幕。作為印太地區政治軍事議題上最重要的國際論壇，美國與中國都試圖透過這個大舞台，積極對外展現姿態。美國防長奧斯汀以溝通對話為基調，不但與日韓菲律賓等多個印太親密盟友對談，也與中方展開破冰對話，還在公開演說中，重申對台海、南海等地區安全的承諾。而中國防長董軍則是高調展現「戰狼姿態」，在公開演說中，左打台獨、右批美國，還語帶威脅地強調，中方的忍耐克制有限。分析認為，中方表態目的是對內宣傳，但可能會讓國際社會對北京加倍警戒。\n\n中國大陸國防部長 董軍：「誰膽敢把台灣從中國分裂出去，必將粉身碎骨、自取滅亡。」\n\n周日(6月2日)結束的「新加坡香格里拉對話」上，大陸防長董軍不但針對台海議題嚴詞恫嚇，還以不點名方式，痛批美國等「外部勢力」用「切香腸」方式，掏空一中，甚至煽動菲律賓在南海「惹事」，嚴重干預亞太安全事務。\n\n中國大陸國防部長 董軍：「在烏克蘭危機上，中方一直以負責任的態度，勸和促談。」\n\n至於國際社會高度關注的烏俄戰局，董軍以中國沒有向任何一方提供武器，也嚴格管控軍民兩用物資，要把自己放在道德高位上。\n\n但中方表態，明顯不被其他參與對話的國家所接受，尤其是緊接在董軍後公開發言的烏克蘭總統澤倫斯基，就直接打臉北京。\n\n烏克蘭總統 澤倫斯基：「是的，我們對一些世界領袖，尚未確認參加和平峰會感到失望。不幸的是，更有人試圖破壞和平峰會。」\n\n他不但對中方缺席本月中將在瑞士登場的「和平峰會」表示失望，更直指北京當局已成為「普欽的工具」，與俄方聯手試圖阻止其他國家參與和平峰會。同時以美國和中國參與峰會的態度作對比，暗批北京當局嘴上說得好聽，行動上卻是更加與俄羅斯沆瀣一氣。\n\n烏克蘭總統 澤倫斯基：「最主要的是，美國已經確認會有政府高層參與峰會，而中國卻沒有確認任何級別的參與，這是兩個完全相反的立場。」\n\n烏克蘭之外，近期多次在南海與中方發生衝突的菲律賓，總統小馬可仕也在香格里拉對話所發表的主題演說中，以不點名方式，直批北京當局在南海的非法脅迫與侵略行為，並強調，任何解決南海爭議的方式都必須以國際法為基礎，菲國在主權問題上「不會屈服」。\n\n菲律賓總統 小馬可仕：「如果菲律賓公民被故意殺害，我認為這非常接近我們定義的戰爭行為，因此我們將做出相應反應。」\n\n小馬可仕也再度畫出「紅線」，強調北京的南海非法脅迫行徑若造成菲國軍人甚至平民死亡，都將被視為戰爭行為，迫使菲方啟動與美國之間的《共同防禦條約》。\n\n美國國防部長 奧斯汀：「我將繼續強調，我們對 (美菲)《共同防禦條約》的承諾，是牢不可破的。只有亞洲安全，美國才會安全，這就是美國長期以來保持在區域內部署的原因。我們支持台灣海峽維持現狀，我們支持在南海維持法治。」\n\n奧斯汀則在演說中強調，美方堅定維護印太地區的安全承諾，包括台海與南海，並將持續在印太地區保持威懾力；同時也會繼續與中方保持溝通，管控風險、避免誤判。\n\n在三天的香格里對話期間，奧斯汀馬不停蹄的與亞太地區盟友展開會談，包括與日本、南韓防長共同強烈反對在印太地區，企圖以武力片面改變現狀的作法，並強調台海和平穩定的重要性；此外，3人也同意新設涵蓋多領域的聯合軍事演習。\n\n奧斯汀與東協各國防長集體會面之外，還分別與菲律賓防長、馬來西亞防長，以及今年10月將就任印尼總統的現任防長普拉伯沃（Prabowo Subianto），展開一對一會談。\n\n澳洲防長 馬勒斯（Richard Marles）：「我們必須關注中國的戰略行為及其釋放的信號。」.\n\n日本防衛大臣 木原稔：「目前印太地區的安全環境不容樂觀，也不排除未來印太地區國際秩序的基礎動搖的可能性。」\n\n南韓防長 申源湜：「希望中方繼續為維護朝鮮半島穩定和無核化，作出更多建設性積極努力。」\n\n多國防長更在公開演說中，用點名或者不點名的方式，提出對北京當局在地區行徑內的擔憂，以及希望中方能有夠多建設性作為的期待，對於中國的高度警戒態度，不言可喻。\n\n而中國防長則在對話期間，僅與日本、加拿大，以及地主新加坡高層有公開的雙邊互動，不難看出亞太地區國家，對北京提高警戒、保持距離的態度。\n\n美國防長 奧斯汀：「我們正在以前所未有的方式與我們的盟友和夥伴合作，許多的朋友也在以新的重要方式，相互合作。」\n\n美方透過香格里拉對話，加強與盟友之間的合作，甚至促成盟友與盟友之間的聯繫。\n\n中國大陸國防部長 董軍：「不允許霸權主義、強權政治，損害亞太；不允許把地緣衝突，冷戰、熱戰，引入亞太。」\n\n北京當局卻選擇在國際場域，積極展現戰狼姿態。分析坦言，這麼做的目的，恐怕還是藉機對內宣傳，至於改善中國的國際形象與對外關係，恐怕收效甚微。",

In contrast, Chinese Defense Minister Li Shangfu adopted a more aggressive stance, criticizing Taiwan independence and U.S. interference, and warning of limited Chinese patience.\n\nLi also addressed the Ukraine conflict, claiming China’s neutrality and responsible behavior, but his statements were met with skepticism, particularly by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who criticized China for not participating in an upcoming peace summit and aligning with Russia.\n\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. condemned China's actions in the South China Sea, warning of potential conflict if Filipino lives were threatened, and emphasized adherence to international law. Austin reiterated the U.S. commitment to regional security and maintaining the status quo in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea.\n\nThroughout the dialogue, Austin held numerous meetings with regional allies, reinforcing opposition to unilateral changes in the Indo-Pacific and agreeing on joint military exercises. The event highlighted growing international concerns over China's actions and the strengthening of U.S. alliances in the region."

        "body": "【文/观察者网 王慧、房佶宜】6月2日，为期三天的第21届香格里拉对话会正式落幕。近期，由于菲律宾频繁挑衅导致中菲南海问题升温，南海局势因此成为\"香会\"的关注焦点议题之一。\n\n观察者网注意到，5月31日的\"香会\"开幕晚宴上，主办方邀请菲律宾总统马科斯作主旨演讲。这是2009年第8届香格里拉对话会开始设置开幕晚宴主旨演讲环节后，菲律宾总统第一次作主旨演讲。\n\n\"马科斯做开幕演讲，是主办方的精心安排\"\n\n香格里拉对话会是由英国国际战略研究所发起、在新加坡政府支持下于2002年开始举办的多边论坛，因其每年在新加坡的香格里拉酒店举行而得名。\n\n军事专家赵小卓告诉观察者网，\"香会\"是由美西方主导、为美西方利益服务的，\"这次请马科斯做开幕演讲也是主办方的精心安排\"。\n\n军事专家张军社认为，主办方抓住地区存在的矛盾，邀请矛盾当事方进行演讲，也有引发\"交锋\"、吸引眼球的意图。\n\n今年\"香会\"，主办方除了邀请菲律宾总统马科斯做开幕晚宴演讲和之外，还邀请了乌克兰总统泽连斯基参会。\n\n值得注意的是，\"香会\"现场没有出现俄罗斯代表。据路透社报道，自2022年乌克兰危机以来，俄罗斯代表就没有出现在\"香会\"现场。\n\n到底是主办方没邀请，还是俄罗斯代表团拒绝参会不得而知。\n\n赵小卓认为，俄罗斯受邀但不参加的可能性远远小于香会没有发出邀请的可能性。他提到，今年的慕尼黑安全会议主办方就没邀请俄罗斯的官方代表，反而邀请了俄反对派人士。\n\n\"这些安排在一定程度上也说明主办方的态度和立场。\"张军社说，虽然\"香会\"一直声称公平中立，但其议程设计、邀请对象等都有被美西方国家影响的痕迹，实际上是西方国家在搭台\"唱戏\"。\n\n菲律宾总统马科斯在第21届\"香会\"发表讲话。（视觉中国）\n\n\"菲律宾成为美国在'印太地区'的马前卒\"\n\n在\"香会\"开幕晚宴主旨演讲中，马科斯讲到，菲律宾面临着从气候变化到地区紧张局势加剧等一系列挑战，主要内容包括所谓\"基于规则的国际秩序\"、维护东盟中心地位、呼吁中美理性竞争等，并且因为频频提及美国引发关注。\n\n赵小卓指出，菲律宾代表之前在\"香会\"上的发言都是比较谨慎、克制的，但马科斯这次讲话很出格、很有攻击性。结合菲律宾近期的表现说明，至少在马科斯这个任期内，南海问题会是个很大的挑战，目前菲律宾明显已经选边站队，甚至成为美国在\"印太地区\"的马前卒。\n\n与菲律宾上届政府不同，马科斯上台后，美菲高层交往频次增加，军事合作明显加强。\n\n赵小卓表示，在军事上，美国在整个太平洋地区是三线部署，原本有\"三条岛链\"。\"过去美军的部署基本都在日本和韩国，在东南亚的军事存在比较弱，而最近一年来，最大的变化是美国在菲律宾的军事存在大大加强。\"\n\n借助美菲《加强防务合作协议》，美国先后获得了9个菲律宾军事基地的使用权，美军得以在这些基地进行轮换，以及储存防务装备和补给。\n\n\"其最终目的是在台海或南海爆发危机时，让菲律宾成为美国干预整个地区安全形势的重要抓手。\"赵小卓指出。\n\n除此之外，美菲还通过举行演习强化军事联系。\n\n菲律宾和美国在4月底举行了\"肩并肩2024\"演习。美国《防务新闻》网站透露，在这场演习中，美军借机测试了菲律宾向其开放的军事基地的战略有效性。\n\n值得注意的是，美方以演习为由，在菲律宾部署了中程导弹系统。这是冷战结束以来，美方首次在海外和亚太地区部署中导，也是美方2019年退出《中导条约》后首次部署此类武器。\n\n《中导条约》订立于1987年，根据该条约，美苏双方决定不再保留、生产或试验射程500公里至5500公里，作为核武器运载工具的陆基巡航导弹和弹道导弹。\n\n\"美国认为，在西太地区，中国的导弹很强，美国的弱势在于，面对中国的导弹，只能靠反导，但反导成本太高、且技术难度太大，因此美国现在想改变策略，要'以攻对攻'。\"赵小卓表示，美国退出《中导条约》后就放风要在西太地区部署中导，但日本、韩国、澳大利亚等国都不敢接受。因为他们非常清楚，如果允许美国部署中导，对整个地区安全形势意味着什么，中国将会有非常强烈的反应。\n\n\"但这次菲律宾接受了，这是菲律宾又一次出格举动。虽然此次美方是以演习为由，在菲律宾部署了中导，这种部署好像是临时性、暂时性的，但部署的行为已经存在。我们不清楚是否会撤走，即便撤走，这个口子开了之后就意味着，之后若有需要，美军会随时再部署。\"赵小卓补充道。\n\n4月7日，由C-17运载的\"中程能力\"导弹发射系统抵达菲律宾。（美国陆军）\n\n美菲强化军事联系的同时，美日澳菲的军事互动的愈加频繁。\n\n2023年6月，借第20届\"香会\"举办之机，美日澳菲四国防长在新加坡举行了首次会谈，今年5月，四国防长在夏威夷举行第二次防长会谈。\n\n美国彭博社报道称，五角大楼官员私下将美澳日菲的新兴地区伙伴关系称为\"小分队\"（SQUAD）。\n\n这一多边机制成为继美日印澳\"四方安全对话\"（QUAD）和美英澳安全合作伙伴关系\"奥库斯\"（AUKUS）之后，华盛顿用来在亚洲对抗中国的众多地区伙伴关系之一。\n\n张军社表示，澳大利亚和日本是美国所谓\"印太战略\"的\"南北双锚\"，澳大利亚是\"南锚\"，日本是\"北锚\"，都是美国的打手、爪牙。美国想拉拢菲律宾，拉上日澳一起无非就是为了壮大声势。\n\n\"菲律宾勾连美国等域外势力，实际上是在拉大旗做虎皮，为他在南海挑衅中国打气，这是他的核心目的。这一做法对中菲关系造成了严重破坏。\"\n\n张军社认为，菲律宾近期之所以频繁挑衅中国，甚至故意让船只在黄岩岛与中国海警船进行碰撞，是为了将美国真正拉下水。因为美国为了煽动菲律宾挑衅中国多次表示，如果菲律宾水手或士兵死亡，菲律宾可援引《美菲共同防御条约》。\n\n《美菲共同防御条约》于1951年8月签订，核心条款规定\"在太平洋海域对任一方领土与对其在太平洋的军队、船舶或飞机的武装攻击，两国将依约采取行动，对付共同危险\"。\n\n\"美菲狼狈为奸，只能说明美国心虚\"\n\n\"香会\"期间，美国防长奥斯汀和菲律宾总统马科斯被问过类似的问题：若有菲律宾公民或军人被杀害，是否会触发《美菲共同防御条约》？\n\n奥斯汀在表示不愿揣测的同时，强调共同防御条约坚定如铁。马科斯则说，这将与菲律宾定义的战争行为非常接近，\"几乎肯定越过红线\"，菲律宾将作出相应的回应，并相信会获得条约盟友美国的支持。\n\n中国国际问题研究院亚太研究所特聘研究员项昊宇告诉观察者网，他认为，美菲再提《美菲共同防御条约》的表态是老调重弹，并无新意。美国要\"以海制华\"，马科斯要\"倚美制华\"，南海问题成为双方一拍即合的抓手。\n\n\"美国重申对菲条约承诺，无非是想给菲律宾继续在南海挑事撑腰打气，马科斯则想借美国的靠山来说服菲国内对他强硬做法的支持。当然，美菲双方也想以此来吓阻中方的维权行动，但这不会产生实际效果，双方也是心知肚明。\"\n\n项昊宇认为，这次双方的表态更像是一次\"例行公事\"。\"如果细品两人的表态，可以发现都不是很有底气，实际上言辞之中都想留有余地，给可能出现的极端情况留下解释的空间。毕竟美方不会轻易为了南海的岛礁与中国陷入直接军事对抗，菲律宾也难以承受对华关系全面破局的后果和代价。\"\n\n中国海警依法驱离菲非法进入我仁爱礁邻近海域船只。（微信公众号\"中国海警\"）\n\n军事专家宋忠平表示，美国用《美菲共同防御条约》来强调自己对菲律宾的责任，有个问题必须注意 -- -- 《美菲共同防御条约》本质是保护菲律宾的领土，其中并不包括南海，只是拜登政府想扩大到南海，所以这种保护、防卫本身就是非法的。\n\n宋忠平说：\"美国口口声声为菲律宾提供协防，其实只是在给菲律宾撑腰、打气，而菲律宾因为这些表态，不断狐假虎威，认为可以肆无忌惮地挑衅中国。这两个国家的狼狈为奸，只能说明美国心虚。\"\n\n\"从俄乌冲突中可以看出，美国并不想承担更多的义务，只想享受更多的利益。\"宋忠平说，美国不会为了菲律宾的国家安全和中国进行所谓的军事对抗，因为这不符合美国的利益。美国只想让菲律宾成为自己的帮凶，服务于自己的区域利益、区域霸权和全球霸权。\n\n他认为，由于新兴国家的不断崛起，美国在世界范围内的份额减少，现在正处于弱霸权时代。美国想打造新的强霸权时代，但只靠美国自己的力量是做不到的，需要对新兴国家实施各种施压，让包括菲律宾在内的盟国听从于美国的政治安排，服务于美国的政治利益，最终共同实现美国的强霸权时代，也就是以美国为首的西方集体霸权时代。美国的想法很丰满，但现实很骨感，很难实现，毕竟凝聚人心不是容易的事。",

The event, organized by the International Institute for Strategic Studies and supported by the Singapore government, featured a keynote speech by Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., marking the first time a Philippine president has delivered such an address at the forum.\n\nMarcos's speech, which emphasized challenges like climate change and regional tensions, notably mentioned the U.S. frequently, reflecting the Philippines' recent alignment with American interests in the Indo-Pacific region. This shift contrasts with the previous Philippine administration and has led to increased U.S.-Philippine military cooperation, including the use of Philippine bases by U.S. forces and joint military exercises.\n\nThe forum also saw the absence of Russian representatives, likely due to the ongoing Ukraine crisis, highlighting the West's influence on the event's agenda. The U.S. has been strengthening its regional alliances, including a new partnership with Japan, Australia, and the Philippines, aimed at countering China.\n\nExperts argue that the U.S. is using the Philippines to bolster its strategic position in the region, while the Philippines seeks U.S. support to challenge China in the South China Sea. However, there is skepticism about the U.S.'s willingness to engage in direct conflict with China over the South China Sea, suggesting that both countries are cautious about escalating tensions too far."

        "body": "外交部发言人就菲律宾总统马科斯在香格里拉对话会发表涉南海问题演讲答记者问\n\n新华社北京6月3日电 外交部发言人3日就菲律宾总统马科斯在香格里拉对话会发表涉南海问题演讲答记者问。\n\n有记者问：菲律宾总统马科斯在第21届香格里拉对话会上发表主题演讲，阐述菲律宾领土范围的所谓法律依据，声称《联合国海洋法公约》和南海仲裁裁决均承认菲合法权利，是菲南海政策的基石。中方对此有何回应？\n\n发言人说，菲方有关表态罔顾历史和事实，宣扬其涉海错误立场，歪曲渲染海上事态。发言人阐明中方立场如下：\n\n第一，中国对南海诸岛拥有无可争辩的主权，对相关海域拥有主权权利和管辖权。中国最早发现、命名和开发利用南海诸岛及相关海域，最早开始并持续、和平、有效地对南海诸岛及相关海域行使主权和管辖。中国在南海的领土主权和海洋权益具有充分的历史和法理依据。中方在本国管辖海域开展正常的巡航执法、生产作业等活动，符合《联合国海洋法公约》在内的国际法，无可非议。\n\n第二，菲律宾的领土范围不包括中国南海诸岛。菲律宾的领土范围是由包括1898年《美西和平条约》、1900年《美西关于菲律宾外围岛屿割让的条约》、1930年《关于划定英属北婆罗洲与美属菲律宾之间的边界条约》在内的一系列国际条约确定的。中国南沙群岛和黄岩岛并不在上述条约规定的菲领土范围之内。菲律宾武力侵占中国南沙群岛部分岛礁，通过所谓《群岛基线法案》等国内立法对中国黄岩岛和南沙群岛部分岛礁提出非法领土主张，严重侵犯中方主权和主权权利，严重违反《联合国宪章》在内的国际法，中方坚决反对。\n\n第三，南海仲裁案所谓裁决是非法的、无效的。菲律宾未经中国政府同意，单方面提起国际仲裁，违反包括《联合国海洋法公约》在内的国际法，违反《南海各方行为宣言》。南海仲裁案仲裁庭越权审理，枉法裁判，所作出的裁决是非法的、无效的。中方不接受、不参与南海仲裁案，不接受、不承认该裁决，也不接受任何基于该裁决的主张和行动。中国在南海的领土主权和海洋权益在任何情况下不受该裁决影响。菲律宾将非法裁决废纸奉为圭臬，无助于中菲涉海争议的解决，更不会为其非法主张增加任何合法性。\n\n第四，近期中菲南海问题升温的责任完全在菲方。菲律宾违背自身承诺和中菲共识，违反《南海各方行为宣言》，出尔反尔、背信弃义；频繁在海上侵权挑衅、制造事端；伙同域外势力在南海拉帮结派、炫耀武力；四处散播污蔑抹黑中方的虚假信息，误导国际社会认知。需要指出的是，美国出于地缘政治私利，支持配合菲方的侵权行径，利用南海问题挑拨中国与地区国家关系，扮演了极不光彩的角色。当前菲律宾外交政策为谁服务，海上行动为谁卖命，明眼人看得很清楚，自欺欺人不会让菲方取信于国际社会。地区国家应对此保持高度警惕，将南海和平稳定的主导权牢牢掌握在自己手中。\n\n第五，当前，在中国和东盟国家的共同努力下，南海局势保持总体稳定。各国依法享有的航行和飞越自由不存在任何问题。中方愿继续和包括菲律宾在内的东盟各国一道，管控海上分歧，深化涉海合作，全面有效落实《南海各方行为宣言》，积极推动\"南海行为准则\"磋商，共同维护南海和平稳定，把南海建设成为和平之海、友谊之海、合作之海。",

        "body": "央视网消息：香格里拉对话会期间，中国国防部长董军围绕\"中国的全球安全观\"发表主旨演讲，就台海局势、南海问题等议题阐述中方立场，引起舆论关注。\n\n马来西亚《星报》：捍卫领土完整的坚定决心\n\n中国国防部长董军表示，\"台独\"分裂行径不利于亚太地区的和平稳定，任何鼓吹\"台独\"的个人和群体都会被钉在历史的耻辱柱上。中国国防部长的主旨演讲，向外界传递出中方一贯捍卫领土完整的坚定决心。中方认为，\"亚太地区是和平发展的大舞台，不是地缘博弈的竞技场\"，希望有关方面认清利害，停止煽动\"台独\"，制造分裂。\n\n泰国《曼谷邮报》：亚太战略环境日趋复杂\n\n亚太地区战略环境正变得更加复杂和紧张，这一点在中国国防部长的主旨演讲中有所体现。董军在批评美国所谓\"切香肠\"战略时强调，任何一个国家都不应以任何名义随意干涉他国的海洋权益，更不应拉拢地区国家煽动冲突和对立。分析称，邻居之间偶尔发生争吵是正常现象，但亚太地区各国需要通过对话和协商解决分歧，而不是煽风点火、引狼入室。\n\n澳大利亚《先驱太阳报》：友好沟通基于共同努力\n\n在香格里拉对话会期间，中国国防部长董军与美国国防部长奥斯汀举行会谈，讨论重点之一是恢复军事对话，这被视为防止热点争端失控的关键。中方强调，中美需要更多军事交流，然而友好沟通应基于双方的共同努力，双方需要相向而行。分析称，中方对中美军事交流持开放态度，中方期望中美继续为维护亚太和平稳定进行沟通。\n\n俄罗斯《生意人报》：警惕外部势力挑唆搅局\n\n针对近日菲律宾允许美国在其领土上部署导弹的行为，中国国防部长表示，这是美国刻意误导地区国家卷入地缘政治冲突的表现，只会搅乱地区安全局势。分析称，美国不断巩固联盟、插手地区事务，进而为自身谋取更多现实利益。然而这些联盟只会加剧地区不稳定性，需要警惕一些国家在外部势力的挑唆下刻意挑起事端。",

        "body": "据环球时报报道，第21届香格里拉对话会举行期间，美国防长奥斯汀在发言中不具名批评中国，大谈\"印太战略\"，并强调将继续采取一系列针对中国的区域威慑行动。按照演讲顺序，我防长董军将在奥斯汀结束演讲后的第二天发言，就台湾问题进行了明确表态。\n\n董军的发言围绕\"中国的全球安全观\"作为主题，阐述了中国的长远发展之道，并就南海问题、亚太局势等国际热点话题，表明了中方一贯坚持的原则和立场。董军强调，当前南海局势总体稳定，希望个别国家认清利害关系，回归对话协商的正道。维护国家主权和领土完整是中国军队的神圣使命，中方将以及时坚决有力的作为，扼止\"台独\"，确保其图谋永无得逞之日。此外，董军还针对其他国际热点话题，重申了中方立场。\n\n纵观董军的整个发言，演讲始终以\"维护区域和平，反对外部干涉\"为主基调。在当前国际局势充满诸多不稳定因素之际，中国始终愿意成为维护区域和平稳定的中坚力量，致力于通过对话协商解决国家或地区的争端。对于美西方国家的强权霸凌主义，以及\"丛林法则\"中方坚决反对，\"兼爱非攻\"是中国战略文化的核心。\n\n值得一提的是，国内外媒体记者为了从董军防长的发言会中，了解中国的国防政策和理念，特意与主办方沟通，希望能够在媒体室使用中文播放董军防长的发言内容，最终主办方改变了以往使英语翻译作为外放声的播放方式，使用中文同声传译。\n\n结束演讲后，董军在问答环节再次阐述中方在台湾问题上的相关立场。董军批评外部势力向台湾地区出售武器时，主持人却突然打断发言，询问中方在中东和乌克兰问题上的立场。对此，董军面不改色、镇定自若的表示，台湾问题事关我们核心利益中核心问题，必须先把这个讲完。\n\n随后，董军接着阐述中方立场称，在强大的人民军队面前，\"台独\"分子就是螳臂当车、自欺欺人，这种行为造成的结果就只能是加速灭亡。董军强调，中方对任何的\"台独\"的极端情景、情势准备得非常充分，也有能力对付\"台独\"武装，就像瓮中捉鳖，不足挂齿。\n\n董军防长在讲话期间，主持人有意打断其发言，并试图将讲话内容引导到其他话题上，这是不尊重发言人的表现，也说明该主持人缺失专业素养。据了解，打断董军防长发言的主持人是巴斯蒂安·吉格里奇，是香格里拉对话会主办方，伦敦国际战略研究所的国防和军事分析主任。董军阐述中方的核心立场时，巴斯蒂安·吉格里奇刻意将话题转移到其他问题，背后动机不言自明。\n\n对于主持人打断其发言，董军面不改色继续阐述立场，足以说明台湾问题的重要性。尤其是在台海局势持续升温，外部势力不断插手干涉的背景下，中方更需要表达其维护国家主权和领土完整的坚定决心，反对美西方国家试图以\"切香肠\"的方式，阻碍两岸统一进程的稳步推进。台湾当归是所有14亿中华儿女的共同愿望，自始至终都不会发生任何变化。解放军东部战区举行的\"联合利剑-2024A\"军事演习，就是反击外部干涉以及岛内谋\"独\"行径的有力方式，未来诸如此类的军事活动只会更加频繁，我们\"反独促统\"的决心会更加坚定。返回搜狐，查看更多",

Despite being interrupted by the moderator, Bastian Giegerich, Director of Defense and Military Analysis at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Dong Jun insisted on finishing his points about Taiwan, underscoring its importance to China.\n\nThe speech highlighted China's role as a stabilizing force in regional peace and its opposition to Western hegemony. The event also saw a change in the usual practice, with Dong Jun's speech being broadcast in Chinese instead of English, reflecting the interest in China's defense policies.\n\nDong Jun's firm response to the interruption and his detailed exposition on Taiwan underscored China's unwavering stance on the issue, especially amid rising tensions and external interventions. The speech concluded with a reaffirmation of China's resolve to maintain national unity and counter any moves towards Taiwan's independence."

        "body": "中菲南海爭端升級之際，菲律賓總統小馬可仕5月31日在香會開幕式發表主題演講時，宣示菲在南海爭議水域的主權聲張，並示警北京勿在南海衝突中跨越紅線。對此，大陸外交部提6點主張回應。\n\n大陸外交部6月3日發布「外交部發言人就菲律賓總統馬科斯（即小馬可仕，Ferdinand Marcos Jr.）在香格里拉對話會發表涉南海問題演講答記者問」，文中斥責菲方有關表態罔顧歷史和事實，宣揚其涉海錯誤立場，歪曲渲染海上事態。對此，陸外交部提出6點闡明中方立場。\n\n陸外交部首先稱，「第一，中國對南海諸島擁有無可爭辯的主權，對相關海域擁有主權權利和管轄權。中國最早發現、命名和開發利用南海諸島及相關海域，最早開始並持續、和平、有效地對南海諸島及相關海域行使主權和管轄」。\n\n陸外交部強調中國大陸在南海的領土主權和海洋權益有充分歷史和法理依據。中方在本國管轄海域進行正常巡航執法、生產作業等活動，符合《聯合國海洋法公約》在內的國際法。\n\n陸外交部接著談到，第二，菲律賓的領土範圍不包含「中國南海諸島」，菲的領土範圍是由包括1898年《美西和平條約》、1900年《美西關於菲律賓外圍島嶼割讓的條約》、1930年《關於劃定英屬北婆羅洲與美屬菲律賓之間的邊界條約》在內的國際條約確定的。\n\n陸外交部稱，南沙群島和黃岩島並不在上述條約規定的菲領土範圍內。菲律賓武力侵占南沙群島部分島礁，通過《群島基線法案》等國內立法對黃岩島和南沙群島部分島礁提出「非法領土主張」，嚴重侵犯中方主權和主權權利，違反《聯合國憲章》在內的國際法，中方堅決反對。\n\n陸外交部在第三點提到，「南海仲裁案所謂裁決是非法的、無效的」，指稱菲未經北京同意，單方面提起國際仲裁，違反包括《聯合國海洋法公約》在內的國際法，違反《南海各方行為宣言》。\n\n陸外交部強調，南海仲裁案仲裁庭越權審理，枉法裁判，所作的裁決是非法、無效的。中方不接受、不參與南海仲裁案，不接受、不承認該裁決，也不接受任何基於該裁決的主張和行動。「中國在南海的領土主權和海洋權益在任何情況下不受該裁決影響」。菲律賓將非法裁決廢紙奉為圭臬，無助於中菲涉海爭議的解決，更不會為其非法主張增加任何合法性。\n\n第四，陸外交部指近期中菲南海問題升溫的責任完全在菲方。菲違背自身承諾和中菲共識，違反《南海各方行為宣言》；頻繁在海上侵權挑釁、製造事端；夥同域外勢力在南海拉幫結派、炫耀武力；四處散播污蔑抹黑中方的虛假信息，誤導國際社會認知。\n\n陸外交部稱，美國出於地緣政治私利，支持配合菲方的侵權行徑，利用南海問題挑撥中國大陸與地區國家關係，扮演極不光彩角色。「當前菲律賓外交政策為誰服務，海上行動為誰賣命，明眼人看得很清楚，自欺欺人不會讓菲方取信於國際社會。地區國家應對此保持高度警惕，將南海和平穩定的主導權牢牢掌握在自己手中」。\n\n第五，大陸外交部稱在其與東盟（東南亞國協）國家的共同努力下，南海局勢保持總體穩定。各國依法享有的航行和飛越自由不存在任何問題。中方願繼續和包括菲律賓在內的東盟各國一道，管控海上分歧，深化涉海合作，全面有效落實《南海各方行為宣言》，積極推動「南海行為準則」磋商，共同維護南海和平穩定，把南海建設成為和平、友誼、合作之海。\n\n陸外交部最後稱，第六，中方將繼續堅定維護自身的領土主權和海洋權益，同時始終堅持同直接有關當事國在尊重歷史事實的基礎上，通過談判協商妥處涉海矛盾分歧。「我們敦促菲方重信守諾，恪守國際條約確定的領土範圍，全面有效落實《南海各方行為宣言》，立即停止海上侵權挑釁，盡快回到通過對話協商妥善處理海上矛盾分歧的正確軌道上來」。",

On May 31, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. asserted the Philippines' sovereignty over disputed waters at the Shangri-La Dialogue, warning Beijing against crossing red lines. In response, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on June 3, presenting six points to counter Marcos' claims, accusing the Philippines of ignoring historical facts and distorting the situation.\n\n1. China claims indisputable sovereignty over the South China Sea islands and related waters, citing historical discovery and continuous, peaceful administration.\n2. The Ministry argues that international treaties, including the 1898 Treaty of Paris, do not include the disputed islands within Philippine territory, accusing the Philippines of illegal occupation and legislation.\n3. China rejects the 2016 South China Sea arbitration ruling as illegal and invalid, asserting it does not affect China's territorial claims.\n4. The Ministry blames the Philippines for escalating tensions, accusing it of violating agreements, provoking incidents, and collaborating with external forces like the U.S.\n5. China emphasizes its cooperation with ASEAN countries to maintain stability and freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, expressing willingness to manage disputes and promote peace.\n6. China urges the Philippines to honor international treaties, cease provocations, and return to dialogue-based conflict resolution.\n\nThe situation underscores ongoing tensions and the complex geopolitical dynamics in the South China Sea."

        "body": "45国代表面前，董军防长对台军的称呼变了，最后送给他们8个字\n\n新加坡的香格里拉对话会已经落下帷幕，正如事前预期的一样，本届香会最大的看点，就是中美在各种场合下的交锋。既有两国防长的面对面对话，也有在防务论坛上的针锋相对。\n\n作为东道主，新加坡的态度很耐人寻味。在欢迎晚宴上，主办方特意安排了两张主桌，中美防长各坐一张。\n\n董军防长身边的两名嘉宾，是前不久交出手中大权的新加坡前总理李显龙，以及英国伦敦国际战略研究所的主席。至于美国防长这里，则是现任总理黄循财和菲律宾总统小马科斯。这显然是有意为之，看得出来新加坡在座位布置上花了不少心思。\n\n从现场视频能看到，晚宴期间，董军防长跟李显龙进行了简短的交谈，奥斯汀还是那副寡言少语的作风，很少与人互动。黄循财倒是跟菲律宾总统小马科斯谈得很愉快，估计是在为日后的高层互动做铺垫。\n\n这里补充一句，奥斯汀跟董军防长见完面后，第二天又在公开演讲上表示，尽管亚太紧张局势升级，但与中国开战并非\"迫在眉睫\"，两军恢复高级别对话，能够有效避免误判和误解。\n\n【李显龙坐在董军防长旁边，晚宴还没正式开始，所以两人表情较严肃】\n\n但这种明显是场面话，主要目的是安抚国际社会，暗示美国现在还不会和中国\"摊牌\"。只是以中美目前的态势而言，如果不在关键问题上相向而行，沟通就没有实际意义，想要避免误判也就无从谈起。\n\n而且美国现在跟中国打交道的思路，就是依托自己在亚太的军事同盟体系，让盟友冲在最前面，采取激进的言行，帮忙试探中国的底线，而自己则在后面观察中方的反应。\n\n但如果换成美国自己跟中国面对面，那么翻来覆去就是那么几套说辞，不是说\"不支持台独\"，就是说\"希望与中国管控竞争\"，奥斯汀自然也不例外。\n\n但从他的实际动向来看，这次香会，美国的目标还是要巩固自己在亚太的盟友体系，持续介入地区事务的同时，强化对中国的\"包围圈\"。\n\n【董军防长跟李显龙交谈时，旁边人都在注意听】\n\n而本次香会，负责给美国人冲锋陷阵的，是菲律宾总统小马科斯。他这次目的明确，就是要在南海问题上，和美国一唱一和，给中国划\"战争红线\"的同时，还渲染说，南海问题并非地区问题，而是\"国际性问题\"，摆明了是要给美国介入提供借口。\n\n另外，小马科斯在演讲中频繁提及美国，以至于菲律宾那边都有人怀疑，堂堂菲律宾总统的演讲稿，背后是不是美国人代劳的。但换个角度来想，即便美国人没打招呼，小马科斯这点自觉还是有的。\n\n美菲虽然看起来咄咄逼人，不过我们这边也准备了相应的对策。香会最后一天，董军防长做主旨发言，以中国的全球安全观为出发点，全面阐述如何构建地区安全合作新局面，真正做到平等参与、友好交流，没有阵营对抗。\n\n归根结底，无论西方再怎么强调\"基于规则的国际秩序\"，对中国在内的全球南方国家而言，只有以联合国核心、国际法为基础的国际秩序，才是公正、合理的，也是唯一能被接受的体系。\n\n【这次香会，董军防长不乏精彩表述】\n\n而如何推动这一体系，我们的思路，是通过多边军事外交，支持地区国家战略自主，维护正当的安全利益，为发展中国家创造参与安全治理的机会。同时有效发挥地区安全架构作用，坚持真正的多边主义，开展务实开放的防务合作。\n\n而在谈到海上争端时，董军防长先强调，得益于地区国家的共同努力，南海局势整体稳定。换句话说，菲律宾这段时间上窜下跳，虽然对中菲关系造成了很恶劣的影响，但不至于在南海掀起什么风浪。\n\n东盟也坚持原先的立场，那就是南海问题仍然是地区问题。无论菲律宾那边是什么打算，东盟依旧会在\"东盟中心\"框架下，与中方共同解决南海问题。东盟秘书长前几天也表示，争取在明年与中国达成\" 南海行为准则\"。\n\n所以小马科斯鼓吹南海问题是什么\"国际性问题\"，东盟并没有多少成员国买账。\n\n【小马科斯这次亲自为美国人冲锋陷阵】\n\n当然，对菲律宾该有的敲打还是得有。董军防长就不点名地警告说，中方的克制是有限的，而个别国家背弃约定，有预谋地挑起事端，破坏地区安全稳定，最后只会引火烧身。\n\n这里补充一句，之所以不点名菲律宾，可能是考虑到，香会毕竟是多边防务论坛，没必要跟菲律宾耽误时间，点到即止就行。反正该说的已经说了，菲律宾如果打定主意钻牛角尖，到时候别抱怨中方\"言之不预\"就行。\n\n另外，在阐述大陆对台湾问题立场时，面对40多国代表的董军防长也不乏精彩的表述，并且还首次在防长层面，将台军称之为\"台独\"武装，最后还给他们附送上了\"瓮中捉鳖，不足挂齿\"八个字。\n\n从另一个角度来看，这也在说明，美国对台军售，除了暴露拜登政府对台湾问题的真实意图以外，对台海大局的影响基本可以忽略不计。",

Singapore's seating arrangement at the welcome dinner, placing Li next to former Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Austin next to current Prime Minister Lawrence Wong and Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., highlighted the strategic importance of the event.\n\nDuring the dialogue, Austin emphasized that war with China is not imminent and stressed the importance of high-level military communication to avoid misunderstandings. However, the U.S. strategy remains focused on strengthening its alliances in the Asia-Pacific region to counter China.\n\nMarcos Jr. played a significant role in supporting the U.S. stance, particularly on the South China Sea issue, framing it as an international concern to justify U.S. involvement. Despite this, ASEAN countries, including the Philippines, continue to view the South China Sea disputes as regional issues, with efforts ongoing to establish a \"Code of Conduct\" with China.\n\nIn his keynote speech, Li Shangfu outlined China's vision for regional security cooperation, emphasizing multilateral military diplomacy and the importance of the United Nations and international law. He warned against countries that provoke regional instability, indirectly addressing the Philippines.\n\nNotably, Li referred to Taiwan's military as \"Taiwan independence forces\" and dismissed their significance with the phrase \"catching turtles in a jar,\" indicating China's dismissive stance on U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and their limited impact on the broader Taiwan Strait situation."

        "body": "中新社北京6月3日电 针对菲律宾总统马科斯在香格里拉对话会发表涉南海问题演讲，中国外交部发言人6月3日在答记者问时表示，菲方有关表态罔顾历史和事实，宣扬其涉海错误立场，歪曲渲染海上事态。\n\n有记者提问，菲律宾总统马科斯在第21届香格里拉对话会上发表主题演讲，阐述菲律宾领土范围的所谓法律依据，声称《联合国海洋法公约》和南海仲裁裁决均承认菲合法权利，是菲南海政策的基石。中方对此有何回应？\n\n发言人表示，菲方有关表态罔顾历史和事实，宣扬其涉海错误立场，歪曲渲染海上事态。\n\n发言人在阐明中方立场时表示，第一，中国对南海诸岛拥有无可争辩的主权，对相关海域拥有主权权利和管辖权。中国最早发现、命名和开发利用南海诸岛及相关海域，最早开始并持续、和平、有效地对南海诸岛及相关海域行使主权和管辖。中国在南海的领土主权和海洋权益具有充分的历史和法理依据。中方在本国管辖海域开展正常的巡航执法、生产作业等活动，符合《联合国海洋法公约》在内的国际法，无可非议。\n\n发言人说，第二，菲律宾的领土范围不包括中国南海诸岛。菲律宾的领土范围是由包括1898年《美西和平条约》、1900年《美西关于菲律宾外围岛屿割让的条约》、1930年《关于划定英属北婆罗洲与美属菲律宾之间的边界条约》在内的一系列国际条约确定的。中国南沙群岛和黄岩岛并不在上述条约规定的菲领土范围之内。菲律宾武力侵占中国南沙群岛部分岛礁，通过所谓《群岛基线法案》等国内立法对中国黄岩岛和南沙群岛部分岛礁提出非法领土主张，严重侵犯中方主权和主权权利，严重违反《联合国宪章》在内的国际法，中方坚决反对。\n\n发言人指出，第三，南海仲裁案所谓裁决是非法的、无效的。菲律宾未经中国政府同意，单方面提起国际仲裁，违反包括《联合国海洋法公约》在内的国际法，违反《南海各方行为宣言》。南海仲裁案仲裁庭越权审理，枉法裁判，所作出的裁决是非法的、无效的。中方不接受、不参与南海仲裁案，不接受、不承认该裁决，也不接受任何基于该裁决的主张和行动。中国在南海的领土主权和海洋权益在任何情况下不受该裁决影响。菲律宾将非法裁决废纸奉为圭臬，无助于中菲涉海争议的解决，更不会为其非法主张增加任何合法性。\n\n发言人说，第四，近期中菲南海问题升温的责任完全在菲方。菲律宾违背自身承诺和中菲共识，违反《南海各方行为宣言》，出尔反尔、背信弃义；频繁在海上侵权挑衅、制造事端；伙同域外势力在南海拉帮结派、炫耀武力；四处散播污蔑抹黑中方的虚假信息，误导国际社会认知。需要指出的是，美国出于地缘政治私利，支持配合菲方的侵权行径，利用南海问题挑拨中国与地区国家关系，扮演了极不光彩的角色。当前菲律宾外交政策为谁服务，海上行动为谁卖命，明眼人看得很清楚，自欺欺人不会让菲方取信于国际社会。地区国家应对此保持高度警惕，将南海和平稳定的主导权牢牢掌握在自己手中。\n\n发言人表示，第五，当前，在中国和东盟国家的共同努力下，南海局势保持总体稳定。各国依法享有的航行和飞越自由不存在任何问题。中方愿继续和包括菲律宾在内的东盟各国一道，管控海上分歧，深化涉海合作，全面有效落实《南海各方行为宣言》，积极推动\"南海行为准则\"磋商，共同维护南海和平稳定，把南海建设成为和平之海、友谊之海、合作之海。\n\n发言人指出，第六，中方将继续坚定维护自身的领土主权和海洋权益，同时始终坚持同直接有关当事国在尊重历史事实的基础上，通过谈判协商妥处涉海矛盾分歧。我们敦促菲方重信守诺，恪守国际条约确定的领土范围，全面有效落实《南海各方行为宣言》，立即停止海上侵权挑衅，尽快回到通过对话协商妥善处理海上矛盾分歧的正确轨道上来。(完)",

        "title": "莫将滥诉当善意，远交近攻非友邻",
        "body": "2024年5月31日，菲律宾总统小马科斯在2024香格里拉对话会发表演讲，强调某些国际法律程序的\"善意性\"，多次重申南海仲裁案仲裁结果的有效性，并表示其根据南海仲裁案进行了国内立法。菲律宾总统小马科斯演讲中多次提及仲裁案的\"约束力\"，并通过\"国际程序的善意\"暗指南海仲裁程序上符合善意原则是站不住脚的。菲律宾在南海仲裁案程序的启动上没有尽到善意履行国际义务，菲律宾承认仲裁庭的实体裁判结果，未实现善意解释和适用《联合国海洋法公约》。\n\n第一，菲律宾的起诉非基于事实和法律依据，属于典型的滥诉，显然违反善意原则。菲律宾人为地将中菲两国之间的领土和海洋划界问题拆分成多个看似独立的、不具有主权要素的海洋权利或海上活动的诉求，这实际上关涉南海历史性权利等《联合国海洋法公约》未规定事项，非基于《联合国海洋法公约》之下的规定。根据非基于《联合国海洋法公约》之下的规定提起《联合国海洋法公约》下的仲裁，属于典型的违反《联合国海洋法公约》第 300 条之滥诉行为。简言之，菲律宾将非针对《联合国海洋法公约》规定事项和非关涉该公约目的的国际协定之解释和适用的争端提起诉讼，违反了《联合国海洋法公约》第279条和第288条。\n\n第二，菲律宾单方面提起仲裁，侵犯中国作为《联合国海洋法公约》缔约国享有的自主选择争端解决程序和方式的权利。中国早在2006年即根据《联合国海洋法公约》第298条任择性例外条款将涉及海洋划界、历史性海湾或所有权、军事和执法活动等方面的争端排除适用《联合国海洋法公约》具有拘束力的争端解决程序。菲律宾在南海仲裁案中提起的仲裁事项实质上涉及《联合国海洋法公约》第298条有关领土主权、历史性权利及海域划界，却通过刻意包装使得本不应通过仲裁程序解决的争端进入《联合国海洋法公约》附件七的强制仲裁程序仲裁。\n\n第三，菲律宾未能充分完成友好磋商和谈判的前置程序，使得南海仲裁案在缺乏可受理性的情况下被强行启动。根据《联合国海洋法公约》第280-281条，包括《南海各方行为宣言》在内的双多边协定均属当事国之间的协议，所达成有关充分协商的共识内容对菲律宾具有约束力。菲律宾违背《南海各方行为宣言》要求各方通过友好磋商和谈判解决争端的共识，也未能充分履行《联合国海洋法公约》第283条交换意见的义务，未充分就仲裁事项与中国交换意见。\n\n第四，南海仲裁案的各项实体判决均缺少事实和法律依据。其一，仲裁庭错误处理《联合国海洋法公约》与历史性权利的关系并错误否定中国在南海拥有的历史性权利。其二，仲裁庭错误地分割、孤立处理南沙群岛和中沙群岛所属岛礁的法律地位，错误解释和适用法律，特别是《联合国海洋法公约》第121条\"岛屿制度\"。其三，仲裁庭错误否定中国在南海相关活动的合法性，错误认定中国相关活动\"加剧或扩大争端\"。可见，仲裁庭错误认定事实，错误解释和适用法律，对重要事项作出裁定但没有\"叙明其所根据的理由\"等，属于枉法、错误裁判。\n\n综上，菲律宾总统小马科斯演讲中通过\"国际程序的善意\"暗指南海仲裁程序符合善意原则是错误的。南海仲裁案仲裁庭越权管辖、枉法裁判，所作裁决非法无效。任何企图混淆视听的炒作都注定是徒劳的，都掩盖不了裁决非法无效的本质，也阻挡不了中国捍卫自身领土主权和海洋权益的坚定决心，奉劝菲律宾在南海问题上谨慎行事，回归到友好谈判和磋商轨道上来，做友好合作之邻。\n\n本文作者：\n\n白佳玉 南开大学中国式现代化发展研究院高级研究员，南开大学法学院教授、博士生导师。",

        "summary": "On May 31, 2024, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. delivered a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue, emphasizing the \"good faith\" of certain international legal procedures and repeatedly affirming the validity of the South China Sea arbitration ruling. He mentioned that the Philippines has enacted domestic legislation based on this ruling. However, the article argues that the Philippines' initiation of the arbitration process did not fulfill its international obligations in good faith and that the arbitration was a misuse of legal procedures.\n\nKey points include:\n1. The Philippines' lawsuit is deemed baseless and a misuse of legal procedures, violating the principle of good faith.\n2. The unilateral arbitration by the Philippines infringes on China's rights under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to choose its dispute resolution method.\n3. The Philippines failed to complete necessary pre-arbitration consultations and negotiations, violating both bilateral and multilateral agreements.\n4. The arbitration tribunal's rulings lack factual and legal basis, including misinterpretations of historical rights and legal statuses of islands.\n\nThe article concludes that the arbitration tribunal overstepped its jurisdiction and made erroneous rulings, rendering the decisions invalid. It urges the Philippines to return to friendly negotiations and consultations with China.

        "body": "菲律宾总统马科斯在新加坡香格里拉对话会上直接感受到了菲方在南海的挑衅行为所引发的反弹。\n\n日前，马科斯对中方与会人员提出的有关南海问题性质以及菲方在挑起南海紧张局势中所扮演的丑恶角色的问题极力推诿，可见菲方在这方面极为心虚。\n\n马科斯说菲方以1982年《联合国海洋法公约》和2016年仲裁裁决为依据，但领土问题不是《联合国海洋法公约》调整的范围。\n\n《联合国海洋法公约》对领海和岛屿的法律地位、航行自由和海洋争端的解决都有明确定义，如果菲方真的遵守该《公约》，就不会试图将中国岛屿和水域据为己有，也不会以所谓\"航行自由\"为借口进行挑衅，更不会指望域外国家干涉、支持其攫取中国领土。\n\n把南海岛礁争议提交所谓 \" 国际仲裁庭 \"，本身就违反了《南海各方行为宣言》第四条的有关规定，侵犯了中国作为《联合国海洋法公约》缔约国应当享有的权利。临时组建的所谓 \"国际仲裁庭\"以及仲裁也违反了国际法和相关规则。\n\n中国一贯认为国际规则不是极少数国家的\"家法帮规\"，而是反映大多数国家利益和合理诉求的法律法规。中国是这些规则制定的积极参与者、坚定维护者、模范遵守者。\n\n中国始终认为，国家不分大小、贫富、强弱，一律平等。中国绝不会以大欺小，也从来没有以大欺小，但中国历来是有底线的、是讲原则的，也决不允许某些国家胡作非为。\n\n据报道，马尼拉正酝酿在其他中国岛礁上\"坐滩\"，企图向世界造成这些岛屿属于菲律宾的错觉。正是菲律宾在违反和破坏规则，颠倒黑白，抹黑中国，污蔑和攻击中国对其非法和错误行径作出的合理反应。\n\n如果菲方一意孤行，一错再错，地区紧张局势将进一步升级。南海问题的引起，很大程度是作为域外国家的美国挑拨、挑唆造成的。\n\n美国试图在南海播下不和的种子，制造动荡，破坏中国周边发展环境。地区各国应当擦亮眼睛，警惕美国及其代理人祸乱南海，破坏地区和平与稳定。\n\n本文译自《中国日报》6月3日社论\n\n原文标题：Philippines will only be catalyst for crisis acting as a proxy for US' troublemaking\n\n出品：中国日报社论编辑室 中国日报中文网",

        "summary": "**Summary:**\n\nAt the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, Philippine President Marcos faced backlash over the Philippines' provocative actions in the South China Sea. Marcos deflected questions about the Philippines' role in escalating tensions, citing the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the 2016 arbitration ruling. However, the article argues that territorial issues are not covered by UNCLOS and criticizes the Philippines for attempting to claim Chinese islands and waters under the guise of \"freedom of navigation.\" The article also condemns the Philippines for violating the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea by seeking international arbitration, which it claims infringes on China's rights. It accuses the Philippines of creating false perceptions about island ownership and warns that continued provocations could escalate regional tensions. The article attributes much of the South China Sea conflict to U.S. interference, suggesting that the U.S. aims to destabilize the region and urging regional countries to be wary of U.S. intentions."

        "summary": "Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. asserted the Philippines' sovereignty over disputed South China Sea waters during a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore on May 31, warning China against crossing red lines, which he said would be considered an act of war. In response, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a six-point statement on June 3, accusing the Philippines of frequent maritime provocations and collaborating with external forces to challenge China's claims.\n\nKey points from China's response include:\n1. China claims indisputable sovereignty over the South China Sea islands and related waters, citing historical and legal grounds.\n2. The Philippines' territorial claims do not include the South China Sea islands, based on historical treaties.\n3. The 2016 South China Sea arbitration ruling is deemed illegal and invalid by China.\n4. China blames the Philippines for escalating tensions and accuses the U.S. of supporting the Philippines for geopolitical reasons.\n5. China asserts that the South China Sea remains stable due to efforts by China and ASEAN countries and calls for continued cooperation.\n6. China urges the Philippines to respect international treaties, cease provocations, and return to dialogue-based conflict resolution.\n\nThe ongoing dispute highlights the increasing tensions between China and the Philippines over maritime sovereignty, with significant implications for regional stability and international relations."

        "body": "小马科斯疯了？他竟然要给中国在南海问题上\"划红线\"\n\n1）日前，在新加坡举行的香格里拉对话会上，菲律宾总统小马科斯竟然对中国划起了红线。\n\n2）他的原话大意是，如果菲律宾有一个士兵在与中国的对峙、冲突中死亡，菲律宾就把这件事视为\"战争行为\"。他还狐假虎威，搬出所谓的美菲共同防御条约来威胁中国，说美国也持有相似的立场。\n\n3）小马科斯上台伊始，中国对他是仁至义尽。但是，很明显，由于他父亲和他家族的原因，很有可能，他们家族贪腐的证据、往海外转移财产的证据，全部被美国掌握在手里，美国现在以此为要挟，让他彻底走上了充当美国\"走狗\"、棋子的不归路。\n\n4）菲律宾，一个蕞尔小国，一个中国仅出动南海舰队部分力量就能让它分分钟\"灭国\"小国，竟然敢堂而皇之给中国在南海问题上划起了红线，这真是\"不作死就不会死\"的巅峰。\n\n5）这一轮南海局势紧张，责任完全在菲律宾。正是小马科斯被美国人胁迫、绑架，才开始粗暴对待中国对小马科斯政府上台之后的善意，才开始撕毁中菲之间曾经达成的谅解与默契。今天的菲律宾政府，在小马科斯的领导下，已经彻底蜕变为一个听命于美国的\"傀儡政权\"。\n\n6）菲律宾为什么敢大言不惭，给中国划红线？首先，这是美国怂恿、挑拨的结果。美国现在为了遏制和打压中国，不断在中国周边找棋子、找炮灰。找来找去，只剩下菲律宾这个\"傻子\"上了钩。小马科斯因为家族贪腐、转移财产等问题被美国捏在手上。美国为了给菲律宾壮胆，不惜反复提及所谓的美菲共同防御条约，好像一旦菲律宾跟中国发生冲突，美国就一定会让自己的士兵替菲律宾卖命一样。美国的胡说八道，给了小马科斯政府一种虚幻的安全感。\n\n7）小马科斯之所以敢对中国大言不惭，划起了红线，另外一个关键原因在于，他明显误解了中国在南海问题上对菲律宾保持克制和耐心的原因。还是那句话，今天小马科斯政府如果屁股发痒，非要找一顿揍，中国随便出出手，就能让这个国家痛不欲生。中国之所以保持克制、保持耐心，主要还是出于维护南海和平与稳定的大局，也是不想让美国利用菲律宾这个笨蛋、傻瓜对中国发起\"代理人冲突\"的阴谋得逞。\n\n8）中菲南海争端的现状是，菲律宾手无缚鸡之力，在南海与中国的对峙、冲突中，占不到一丝一毫的便宜，动不动还被中国的海警船喷水炮，可谓是颜面扫地。但是，菲律宾很会利用舆论，说一些狠话，制造一些喧嚣，这完全是一种跳梁小丑的作为。\n\n9）我个人非常支持中国的海警船、中国海军，适当时给菲律宾一个狠狠的教训。这种腌臜泼才，不狠狠教训它，它就不老实。咱们的海警船，就应该用水炮狠狠轰击菲方船只，让他们长点记性。\n\n10）除此之外，我们也可以考虑，尽快把菲律宾非法坐滩的那艘烂船拆除、拖走。这艘烂船，不仅非法侵犯了中国的主权，而且，长期以来，烂船及船上的菲方人员对当地的海洋环境、生态造成了破坏。拆掉这艘烂船，既是为了维护中国的主权，也是为了保护海洋环境，正所谓天经地义。我们倒要看看，到了那一步，小马科斯政府还能耍出什么把戏？我们更要看看，到了那一步，美国政府能耍出什么把戏？",

The article accuses Marcos of being manipulated by the US due to his family's alleged corruption and assets held abroad. It portrays the Philippines as a minor power emboldened by the US to challenge China, which the article claims could easily overpower the Philippines. The author suggests that China's restraint is aimed at maintaining regional stability and avoiding a proxy conflict instigated by the US. The article calls for a strong response from China, including potential military actions and the removal of a grounded Philippine ship in disputed waters, to assert its sovereignty and protect the marine environment."

        "body": "中国网6月3日讯 据外交部网站消息，外交部发言人3日就菲律宾总统马科斯在香格里拉对话会发表涉南海问题演讲答记者问。答问全文如下：\n\n问：菲律宾总统马科斯在第21届香格里拉对话会上发表主题演讲，阐述菲律宾领土范围的所谓法律依据，声称《联合国海洋法公约》和南海仲裁裁决均承认菲合法权利，是菲南海政策的基石。中方对此有何回应？\n\n答：菲方有关表态罔顾历史和事实，宣扬其涉海错误立场，歪曲渲染海上事态。我愿阐明中方立场如下：\n\n第一，中国对南海诸岛拥有无可争辩的主权，对相关海域拥有主权权利和管辖权。中国最早发现、命名和开发利用南海诸岛及相关海域，最早开始并持续、和平、有效地对南海诸岛及相关海域行使主权和管辖。中国在南海的领土主权和海洋权益具有充分的历史和法理依据。中方在本国管辖海域开展正常的巡航执法、生产作业等活动，符合《联合国海洋法公约》在内的国际法，无可非议。\n\n第二，菲律宾的领土范围不包括中国南海诸岛。菲律宾的领土范围是由包括1898年《美西和平条约》、1900年《美西关于菲律宾外围岛屿割让的条约》、1930年《关于划定英属北婆罗洲与美属菲律宾之间的边界条约》在内的一系列国际条约确定的。中国南沙群岛和黄岩岛并不在上述条约规定的菲领土范围之内。菲律宾武力侵占中国南沙群岛部分岛礁，通过所谓《群岛基线法案》等国内立法对中国黄岩岛和南沙群岛部分岛礁提出非法领土主张，严重侵犯中方主权和主权权利，严重违反《联合国宪章》在内的国际法，中方坚决反对。\n\n第三，南海仲裁案所谓裁决是非法的、无效的。菲律宾未经中国政府同意，单方面提起国际仲裁，违反包括《联合国海洋法公约》在内的国际法，违反《南海各方行为宣言》。南海仲裁案仲裁庭越权审理，枉法裁判，所作出的裁决是非法的、无效的。中方不接受、不参与南海仲裁案，不接受、不承认该裁决，也不接受任何基于该裁决的主张和行动。中国在南海的领土主权和海洋权益在任何情况下不受该裁决影响。菲律宾将非法裁决废纸奉为圭臬，无助于中菲涉海争议的解决，更不会为其非法主张增加任何合法性。\n\n第四，近期中菲南海问题升温的责任完全在菲方。菲律宾违背自身承诺和中菲共识，违反《南海各方行为宣言》，出尔反尔、背信弃义；频繁在海上侵权挑衅、制造事端；伙同域外势力在南海拉帮结派、炫耀武力；四处散播污蔑抹黑中方的虚假信息，误导国际社会认知。需要指出的是，美国出于地缘政治私利，支持配合菲方的侵权行径，利用南海问题挑拨中国与地区国家关系，扮演了极不光彩的角色。当前菲律宾外交政策为谁服务，海上行动为谁卖命，明眼人看得很清楚，自欺欺人不会让菲方取信于国际社会。地区国家应对此保持高度警惕，将南海和平稳定的主导权牢牢掌握在自己手中。\n\n第五，当前，在中国和东盟国家的共同努力下，南海局势保持总体稳定。各国依法享有的航行和飞越自由不存在任何问题。中方愿继续和包括菲律宾在内的东盟各国一道，管控海上分歧，深化涉海合作，全面有效落实《南海各方行为宣言》，积极推动\"南海行为准则\"磋商，共同维护南海和平稳定，把南海建设成为和平之海、友谊之海、合作之海。\n\n第六，中方将继续坚定维护自身的领土主权和海洋权益，同时始终坚持同直接有关当事国在尊重历史事实的基础上，通过谈判协商妥处涉海矛盾分歧。我们敦促菲方重信守诺，恪守国际条约确定的领土范围，全面有效落实《南海各方行为宣言》，立即停止海上侵权挑衅，尽快回到通过对话协商妥善处理海上矛盾分歧的正确轨道上来。",

        "body": "菲律宾总统马科斯在\"香会\"发表涉南海问题演讲，外交部发言人阐明中方立场\n\n外交部发言人就菲律宾总统马科斯在香格里拉对话会发表涉南海问题演讲答记者问\n\n问：菲律宾总统马科斯在第21届香格里拉对话会上发表主题演讲，阐述菲律宾领土范围的所谓法律依据，声称《联合国海洋法公约》和南海仲裁裁决均承认菲合法权利，是菲南海政策的基石。中方对此有何回应？\n\n答：菲方有关表态罔顾历史和事实，宣扬其涉海错误立场，歪曲渲染海上事态。我愿阐明中方立场如下：\n\n第一，中国对南海诸岛拥有无可争辩的主权，对相关海域拥有主权权利和管辖权。中国最早发现、命名和开发利用南海诸岛及相关海域，最早开始并持续、和平、有效地对南海诸岛及相关海域行使主权和管辖。中国在南海的领土主权和海洋权益具有充分的历史和法理依据。中方在本国管辖海域开展正常的巡航执法、生产作业等活动，符合《联合国海洋法公约》在内的国际法，无可非议。\n\n第二，菲律宾的领土范围不包括中国南海诸岛。菲律宾的领土范围是由包括1898年《美西和平条约》、1900年《美西关于菲律宾外围岛屿割让的条约》、1930年《关于划定英属北婆罗洲与美属菲律宾之间的边界条约》在内的一系列国际条约确定的。中国南沙群岛和黄岩岛并不在上述条约规定的菲领土范围之内。菲律宾武力侵占中国南沙群岛部分岛礁，通过所谓《群岛基线法案》等国内立法对中国黄岩岛和南沙群岛部分岛礁提出非法领土主张，严重侵犯中方主权和主权权利，严重违反《联合国宪章》在内的国际法，中方坚决反对。\n\n第三，南海仲裁案所谓裁决是非法的、无效的。菲律宾未经中国政府同意，单方面提起国际仲裁，违反包括《联合国海洋法公约》在内的国际法，违反《南海各方行为宣言》。南海仲裁案仲裁庭越权审理，枉法裁判，所作出的裁决是非法的、无效的。中方不接受、不参与南海仲裁案，不接受、不承认该裁决，也不接受任何基于该裁决的主张和行动。中国在南海的领土主权和海洋权益在任何情况下不受该裁决影响。菲律宾将非法裁决废纸奉为圭臬，无助于中菲涉海争议的解决，更不会为其非法主张增加任何合法性。\n\n第四，近期中菲南海问题升温的责任完全在菲方。菲律宾违背自身承诺和中菲共识，违反《南海各方行为宣言》，出尔反尔、背信弃义；频繁在海上侵权挑衅、制造事端；伙同域外势力在南海拉帮结派、炫耀武力；四处散播污蔑抹黑中方的虚假信息，误导国际社会认知。需要指出的是，美国出于地缘政治私利，支持配合菲方的侵权行径，利用南海问题挑拨中国与地区国家关系，扮演了极不光彩的角色。当前菲律宾外交政策为谁服务，海上行动为谁卖命，明眼人看得很清楚，自欺欺人不会让菲方取信于国际社会。地区国家应对此保持高度警惕，将南海和平稳定的主导权牢牢掌握在自己手中。\n\n第五，当前，在中国和东盟国家的共同努力下，南海局势保持总体稳定。各国依法享有的航行和飞越自由不存在任何问题。中方愿继续和包括菲律宾在内的东盟各国一道，管控海上分歧，深化涉海合作，全面有效落实《南海各方行为宣言》，积极推动\"南海行为准则\"磋商，共同维护南海和平稳定，把南海建设成为和平之海、友谊之海、合作之海。\n\n第六，中方将继续坚定维护自身的领土主权和海洋权益，同时始终坚持同直接有关当事国在尊重历史事实的基础上，通过谈判协商妥处涉海矛盾分歧。我们敦促菲方重信守诺，恪守国际条约确定的领土范围，全面有效落实《南海各方行为宣言》，立即停止海上侵权挑衅，尽快回到通过对话协商妥善处理海上矛盾分歧的正确轨道上来。",

In response, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson refuted Marcos' claims, emphasizing China's historical and legal sovereignty over the South China Sea islands and surrounding waters. The spokesperson criticized the Philippines for distorting facts, illegally occupying Chinese territories, and violating international law, including the UN Charter. China rejected the South China Sea arbitration ruling as illegal and invalid, accusing the Philippines of escalating tensions and collaborating with external forces like the U.S. to undermine regional stability. China reiterated its commitment to maintaining peace and stability in the South China Sea through cooperation with ASEAN countries and urged the Philippines to honor international agreements and resolve disputes through dialogue."

        "body": "问：菲律宾总统马科斯在第21届香格里拉对话会上发表主题演讲，阐述菲律宾领土范围的所谓法律依据，声称《联合国海洋法公约》和南海仲裁裁决均承认菲合法权利，是菲南海政策的基石。中方对此有何回应？\n\n答：菲方有关表态罔顾历史和事实，宣扬其涉海错误立场，歪曲渲染海上事态。我愿阐明中方立场如下：\n\n第一，中国对南海诸岛拥有无可争辩的主权，对相关海域拥有主权权利和管辖权。中国最早发现、命名和开发利用南海诸岛及相关海域，最早开始并持续、和平、有效地对南海诸岛及相关海域行使主权和管辖。中国在南海的领土主权和海洋权益具有充分的历史和法理依据。中方在本国管辖海域开展正常的巡航执法、生产作业等活动，符合《联合国海洋法公约》在内的国际法，无可非议。\n\n第二，菲律宾的领土范围不包括中国南海诸岛。菲律宾的领土范围是由包括1898年《美西和平条约》、1900年《美西关于菲律宾外围岛屿割让的条约》、1930年《关于划定英属北婆罗洲与美属菲律宾之间的边界条约》在内的一系列国际条约确定的。中国南沙群岛和黄岩岛并不在上述条约规定的菲领土范围之内。菲律宾武力侵占中国南沙群岛部分岛礁，通过所谓《群岛基线法案》等国内立法对中国黄岩岛和南沙群岛部分岛礁提出非法领土主张，严重侵犯中方主权和主权权利，严重违反《联合国宪章》在内的国际法，中方坚决反对。\n\n第三，南海仲裁案所谓裁决是非法的、无效的。菲律宾未经中国政府同意，单方面提起国际仲裁，违反包括《联合国海洋法公约》在内的国际法，违反《南海各方行为宣言》。南海仲裁案仲裁庭越权审理，枉法裁判，所作出的裁决是非法的、无效的。中方不接受、不参与南海仲裁案，不接受、不承认该裁决，也不接受任何基于该裁决的主张和行动。中国在南海的领土主权和海洋权益在任何情况下不受该裁决影响。菲律宾将非法裁决废纸奉为圭臬，无助于中菲涉海争议的解决，更不会为其非法主张增加任何合法性。\n\n第四，近期中菲南海问题升温的责任完全在菲方。菲律宾违背自身承诺和中菲共识，违反《南海各方行为宣言》，出尔反尔、背信弃义；频繁在海上侵权挑衅、制造事端；伙同域外势力在南海拉帮结派、炫耀武力；四处散播污蔑抹黑中方的虚假信息，误导国际社会认知。需要指出的是，美国出于地缘政治私利，支持配合菲方的侵权行径，利用南海问题挑拨中国与地区国家关系，扮演了极不光彩的角色。当前菲律宾外交政策为谁服务，海上行动为谁卖命，明眼人看得很清楚，自欺欺人不会让菲方取信于国际社会。地区国家应对此保持高度警惕，将南海和平稳定的主导权牢牢掌握在自己手中。\n\n第五，当前，在中国和东盟国家的共同努力下，南海局势保持总体稳定。各国依法享有的航行和飞越自由不存在任何问题。中方愿继续和包括菲律宾在内的东盟各国一道，管控海上分歧，深化涉海合作，全面有效落实《南海各方行为宣言》，积极推动\"南海行为准则\"磋商，共同维护南海和平稳定，把南海建设成为和平之海、友谊之海、合作之海。\n\n第六，中方将继续坚定维护自身的领土主权和海洋权益，同时始终坚持同直接有关当事国在尊重历史事实的基础上，通过谈判协商妥处涉海矛盾分歧。我们敦促菲方重信守诺，恪守国际条约确定的领土范围，全面有效落实《南海各方行为宣言》，立即停止海上侵权挑衅，尽快回到通过对话协商妥善处理海上矛盾分歧的正确轨道上来。",

The spokesperson emphasized China's historical and legal sovereignty over the South China Sea islands and criticized the Philippines for distorting facts and violating international law. China rejects the arbitration ruling as illegal and invalid, and blames the Philippines for escalating tensions by collaborating with external forces and spreading misinformation. The spokesperson reiterated China's commitment to maintaining regional stability and resolving disputes through negotiation, urging the Philippines to honor international agreements and cease provocative actions."

        "summary": "On May 31, during the 21st Shangri-La Dialogue, Chinese military expert Lieutenant General He Lei questioned the Philippines' stance on the South China Sea disputes. He raised four key points:\n\n1. Submitting the South China Sea disputes to an international arbitration tribunal violates established rules and the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea.\n2. The previous Philippine administration maintained stability in the disputed areas, but tensions have escalated under the current government, particularly around Ren'ai Reef and Scarborough Shoal.\n3. The Philippines claims to support ASEAN's centrality but has formed alliances with the US, Japan, and Australia, conducting joint military exercises, which contradicts the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea.\n4. He questioned whether peace in the South China Sea should be maintained by regional countries or external powers, suggesting that external countries are the main instigators of the conflict.\n\nThe implications are significant, highlighting China's disapproval of international arbitration and external involvement in the South China Sea, and suggesting a preference for regional solutions."

        "body": "就亚太安全提\"三个不允许\"！中方\"香会\"表态引热议\n\n【环球时报赴新加坡特派记者 郭媛丹 李艾鑫 环球时报特约记者 于文】为期3天的第21届香格里拉对话会（以下简称\"香会\"）6月2日进入最后一天，当天上午举行第五次全体会议，主题为\"中国的全球安全观\"，中国国防部长董军作大会主旨发言。\"我们不允许霸权主义、强权政治损害亚太，不允许把地缘冲突、冷战热战引入亚太，不允许任何国家、任何势力在这里生战生乱。\"董军在发言中强调。《日本时报》称，中国防长将\"最严厉的措辞\"留给了台湾问题。他表示，谁胆敢把台湾从中国分裂出去，必将粉身碎骨、自取灭亡。美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）的报道标题称：中国防长警告支持\"台独\"的人将\"自取灭亡\"。新加坡防长黄永宏和一些外媒2日评价称，中国代表团正在学习和适应西方论坛的对话方式，在此次\"香会\"期间加大了宣传力度。参加\"香会\"的中方代表团成员潘庆华告诉《环球时报》记者，无论是本届\"香会\"的全体会议还是各种平行会议，大家在讨论中都很关注中国代表团的观点，从这个角度观察，\"香会\"有利于中国军方声音的对外传播。\n\n中国防长发言被打断仍坚持讲完台湾问题立场\n\n对于出席\"香会\"的代表和媒体而言，中国防长的大会发言无疑是重头戏之一，尤其是在菲律宾总统马科斯5月31日晚、美国防长奥斯汀6月1日在发言中不点名批评中国之后，外界高度关注董军在发言中会如何回应。\n\n《环球时报》记者在现场注意到一个细节：去年\"香会\"期间，主办方在中方发言时使用了英语翻译作为外放声，2日一早，包括国外媒体记者在内的媒体和主办方沟通能否使用中文外放，最终主办方在媒体室使用了中文播放。在主会场外的大厅内，挤满了听众，人们都希望从中国防长发言中观察中国国防政策和理念。\n\n董军在发言中表示，中国的战略文化强调\"兼爱非攻\"。中方坚持通过对话协商解决分歧，鄙视\"丛林法则\"，在处理边界和海上分歧时，从不主动挑起事端，从不轻易诉诸武力，始终与各国共同努力，推动落实《南海各方行为宣言》，加紧\"南海行为准则\"磋商，有效维护了地区和平安宁。\n\nCNN称，由英国智库国际战略研究所（IISS）主办的\"香会\"是亚太地区高级军事官员罕见的聚会，其中包括那些地缘政治竞争对手或相互持谨慎态度的官员。\"这也是听取中国高级军事官员的意见并向其提问的难得机会。代表们向董军提出的许多问题都围绕着中国在整个地区日益增强的自信，特别是关于台湾地区和南海。\"\n\n新加坡《海峡时报》称，在演讲后的问答环节中，董军就有关台湾问题的提问作出详细阐述。当外方主持人试图打断、询问\"中国在乌克兰和中东问题上的立场\"时，董军坚持讲完台湾问题，并表示\"这是我们核心利益的核心问题\"。他说，在强大的人民军队面前，\"台独\"分子就是螳臂当车、自欺欺人，这种行为造成的结果就只能是加速灭亡。中方对任何的\"台独\"的极端情景、情势准备得非常充分，也有能力对付\"台独\"武装，就像瓮中捉鳖，不足挂齿。\n\n东帝汶总统奥尔塔2日在\"香会\"期间接受中国媒体采访时表示，台湾是中国的一部分，尽管美国等外部势力干涉，但这世界上人们的头脑还是清醒的，应该让中国人自己解决台湾问题。\n\n新加坡《联合早报》称，董军还在发言中不点名批评菲律宾在南海仁爱礁\"碰瓷\"制造假象，中国对在南海的侵权挑衅行为保持克制，但这是有限度的，\"个别国家的做法终将会引火烧身\"。\n\n中美\"火药味比往年消减\"\n\n美国防长奥斯汀6月1日在\"香会\"发言。《联合早报》称，奥斯汀在约30分钟的演讲中抛出新的\"合流\"概念，称印太地区的国家如今在安全上有了新的合流，这会形成一个更强大、更有韧性、更有能力的伙伴关系网络，并定义\"印太安全的新时代\"。奥斯汀声称，\"这种合流是为了团结而不是分裂，不是强加一个国家的意志，而是唤醒共同的使命感；不是以大欺小或胁迫，而是让主权国家自由选择\"。\n\n冠冕堂皇的说辞骗不了人。法新社报道称，奥斯汀称赞亚太地区进入了\"安全新时代\"，其背景是华盛顿正加强其联盟网络，以对抗中国日益增长的军事实力和影响力。\n\n《联合早报》称，奥斯汀的演讲随后引来中方批评。1日中午，参加\"香会\"的中国代表团举行中外媒体吹风会。中央军委联合参谋部副参谋长景建峰表示，美国的\"印太战略\"打着促进地区合作的旗号，但实际上却抱守冷战思维和零和博弈，搞封闭排他的俱乐部。美国真正目的是把一个个小圈子融合成\"亚太版北约\"这个大圈子，从而维持美国的霸权地位。\n\n针对奥斯汀在演讲中提及南海问题，景建峰表示，美方的发言为菲律宾站台背书，影射中方正当维权行动，完全没有道理。菲拉拢域外势力介入，美在南海拉偏架，美菲勾连作乱，制造对抗与危机，破坏的是地区和平稳定，损害的是地区国家共同利益。\n\n《联合早报》认为，虽然今年\"香会\"的讨论继续围绕中美竞争，但火药味比往年消减，多了中美隔空强调沟通交流的必要，以及对本区域安全新概念的推销与博弈。中美防长5月31日举行双方一年半以来的首次面对面会晤后，都强调了沟通的重要性。报道称，奥斯汀1日积极评价美中两军高层的沟通，称美中只要保持沟通，就能辨识棘手问题，美国希望设置护栏，确保没有任何误解和误判。\"我告诉董部长，如果他有紧急事务打电话给我，我会接。我当然也希望他能这样做。\"\n\n法新社称，董军2日表示，中方始终对交流合作持开放态度，但这需要双方相向而行。美国《华尔街日报》称，中美防长都在各自发言中缓和与对方的紧张关系，淡化可能发生战争前景的言论，但热点依然存在。\n\n外界关注中国代表团\"加大公开宣传力度\"\n\n\"我在香会切身感受了国际政治的现实性。大国代表发言时，会场内一座难求，听众站满了走廊，围得水泄不通。\"潘庆华说，在不同的会议上，都能听到中国军队频繁地被提及，可见中国军队确实已经是一支具有世界影响、能够影响世界的大国军队。\n\n新加坡亚洲电视台称，新加坡防长黄永宏2日说，美国和中国不需要第三方来帮助解决两国关系中的问题，而是需要\"自行解决\"。他还提到美国总统拜登希望与中国\"竞争\"而不是\"冲突\"的言论，称\"如果他们能做到这一点，那么我认为整个系统是稳定的\"。\n\n据报道，黄永宏还表示，据他观察，中国代表团正在学习和适应西方论坛的对话方式。他举例说，菲总统5月31日晚发表演讲后不久，中国代表马上安排媒体吹风会，表明中方观点。\n\n彭博社2日的报道也称，中方官员在本届\"香会\"上加大了公开宣传力度，进行了一系列媒体吹风会、演讲和高调发言，抨击美国支持\"台独\"，警告\"亚洲版北约\"的扩大，并指责华盛顿对北京实施\"技术封锁\"。黄永宏2日告诉记者：\"事情就应该这样。如果言语不会飞，那么子弹就会。\"\n\n文莱大学哈希姆博士2日在\"香会\"期间对《环球时报》记者表示，各方进行更多对话沟通是必要的，不仅仅是从中国或东盟的角度来看，而是从全球角度看，任何冲突，哪怕是小规模，对我们每一方都是有害的。他说，经济发展和地区安全无法割裂，中国一直是我们非常重要的合作伙伴，在未来也希望继续发展与中国的关系。",

He issued a stern warning against Taiwan independence, stating that any attempt to separate Taiwan from China would lead to destruction.\n\nLi's speech, which was closely watched following criticisms of China by the Philippine President and U.S. Defense Secretary, highlighted China's commitment to peaceful resolution of disputes and regional stability. He criticized the Philippines' actions in the South China Sea and warned against external interference.\n\nThe dialogue saw reduced tensions between the U.S. and China compared to previous years, with both sides emphasizing the importance of communication. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin introduced a new concept of \"confluence\" in Indo-Pacific security, aiming for stronger partnerships without coercion.\n\nChina's increased public engagement at the forum was noted, with officials actively participating in media briefings and discussions. Singapore's Defense Minister Ng Eng Hen remarked on the necessity for the U.S. and China to resolve their issues independently, reflecting a broader call for dialogue and cooperation to ensure regional and global stability."

        "body": "新加坡「香格里拉對話」週日（6月2日）落幕，這場亞洲高級安全論壇的鎂光燈，高度聚焦在中美之間的大國角力，以及北京在台海、南海的軍事行為。其中作為壓軸講者的烏克蘭總統澤倫斯基（Volodymyr Zelenskyy），也罕見對中國提出指控。\n\n論壇期間，美國國防部長奧斯汀（Lloyd Austin）與中國新任防長董軍分別發表了約半小時的演說，並開放台下的與會者提問。5月31日，兩人也在峰會前舉辦雙邊會晤，交流長達75分鐘，並在事後的聲明稿及記者會中表示，中美雙方都同意維持軍事溝通的重要性。\n\n國際危機組織（ICG）資深中國問題專家蕭嫣然（Amanda Hsiao）告訴DW，這是中美關係走在正確方向的第一步，因為在中美角力的情況下，誤讀對方意圖的可能性非常高，而儘管分歧仍存在，「至少我們之間有一套定期的溝通機制」。\n\n然而在許多核心區域安全議題上，雙方各說各話的情況仍顯而易見。中國防長面對其他國家代表提出有關南海、烏克蘭、加薩走廊的具體安全問題時，也被認為避而不答。\n\n蕭嫣然表示，董軍沒有直接回應關於中國意圖的「非常具體的問題」，「中國在傳遞訊息時，向來是對區域的關切充耳不聞（tone-deaf）。他所傳遞的訊息，實際上迴避了該地區許多政府對安全的真實關切」。\n\n董軍2日發表「中國的全球安全觀」演說時表示，「現在大家都很關心中美兩軍關係」，因兩軍關係的穩定，事關全球安全穩定，而中美兩軍之間，「正因為有分歧所以才要多交流，即使道不同，也不能搞對抗」。\n\n同時他也強調，要找到「兩軍正確的相處之道」須仰賴美中雙方的努力。在此論調上，董軍稱中方是負責任、始終秉持開放合作的大國，並指涉美方是「搞集團對抗」造成亞太地區情勢緊張的「外部勢力」。\n\n蕭嫣然分析，董軍試圖將中國描繪成亞太地區的「代言人」，其目的是呼籲地區政府不要站在美國一邊。她告訴DW中國正在推動的論述是，「中國有和平意圖，且問題不在中國，而在美國。」在當前的區域戰爭中，董軍也重申中國在烏克蘭問題上將保持「中立」、不站邊、不供武，並「秉持公正立場」呼籲巴以衝突停火。\n\n新加坡國立大學政治系副教授莊嘉穎則表示，中方試圖營造一種印象，即把台灣、美國和菲律賓描繪成「麻煩製造者」，認為他們旨在製造分裂，是「威脅現有世界秩序的不穩定因素」。\n\n然而在董軍演說結束後，來自韓國的代表發言表示，多數亞太地區的國家都認為，中方實際所作所為，與其所言以「和平發展道路」為核心的區域安全決策「完全相反」。蕭嫣然告訴DW，「中國僅僅聲稱擁有和平意圖已經不夠了」，現今國際社會「已經（對中國）沒有足夠的信任來支撐這一說法」。\n\n在台海議題上，奧斯汀重申美方支持台海維持現狀，並強調區域的爭端與分歧須透過對話而非脅迫或衝突來解決，「當然也不是透過所謂的懲罰」。這番言論雖未指名道姓，但被認為是明顯在抨擊中國。\n\n原因是北京在峰會前夕在台灣周邊展開軍演。當時國台辦發言指，這是對台灣新任總統賴清德5月20日就職演說「謀獨挑釁的堅決懲戒」，也是對「外部勢力縱容支持台獨、干涉中國內政」的嚴厲警告。\n\n這與中國防長在論壇上的台海論述一致。董軍借國際場合批評台灣執政黨民進黨「大搞漸進式台獨」，「頑固推行『去中國化』，妄圖割裂兩岸社會、歷史文化聯繫、數典忘祖的分裂言論荒謬而狂妄，必將被釘在歷史的恥辱柱上」。\n\n同時中方也指控各國正在以「切香腸」方式不斷虛化掏空「一中原則」，「誰膽敢把台灣從中國分裂出去，必將粉身碎骨、自取滅亡。」\n\n在一系列對台言論上，蕭嫣然認為中方使用的語言是比以往「尖銳」，而其目的是試圖警告美國與台灣，並「促使華盛頓向台北提出緩和立場的訊號。」\n\n莊嘉穎則認為，中國透過論壇釋放出「不會放棄對台灣施壓」的信號。「部分原因是北京認為目前沒有太多好的替代方案。如果要加強侵略性，他們早就這麼做了。他們也不想升級衝突，但發現自己不能退讓。所以唯一能做的就是使用憤怒的言語。」\n\n隨後在董軍演說後的問答階段，共有包含台灣、南海、俄烏戰爭及緬甸戰亂等多道提問，但董軍一開始只針對台灣議題高談闊論，遭主持人連續打斷，請他針對其他議題簡短作答。\n\n其中一次遭打斷時，董軍表示：「我想先把台灣議題講完，因為這是我們核心利益的核心問題。」並稱中方對任何「台獨的極端情景準備非常充分、也有能力」，但中國作為一個大國，堅持還是走和平統一的道路，因此奉勸「台獨份子」深入了解《反國家分裂法》的內容，以免觸法。\n\n對此，莊嘉穎認為董軍此舉一來是為了迴避其他問題，因為「談論台灣對他來說是最安全的一個話題。他知道該說些什麼，他不會出錯」，二來是為了極力孤立台灣，進一步將台灣賴清德政府描繪成「倔強、危險、冒進」的形象。\n\n相較上一屆香格里拉論壇，前中國防長李尚福未與奧斯汀會晤，兩人僅有握手寒暄，這一次中美交流顯然增多。然而今年論壇邀請到菲國總統小馬科斯（Ferdinand Marcos Jr.）作為開場演說嘉賓，在關鍵的南海議題上，中美仍存在重大分歧。\n\n小馬科斯在演說中強調，任何解決南海爭議的方式都必須以國際法為基礎，並表示在主權問題上「菲律賓人不會屈服」。他在現場被問及，若中國在南海使用水砲造成菲國人員死傷，這是否將被視為跨越紅線。他答道若中方蓄意造成菲方軍人或公民死亡，「這已非常非常接近我們所定義的戰爭行為」。\n\n隨後奧斯汀也表態認同小馬科斯的演說內容，強調「每個國家，無論大小，都有權享有自己的海洋資源，並在國際法允許的任何地方自由航行和作業」。\n\n菲律賓與中國近期因南海主權之爭頻頻發生海上爭端，菲方並開始強化與澳洲、美國、日本的國防合作。隨著情勢升溫，南海已被視為亞太地區的另一個可能引爆衝突的導火線。\n\n但董軍在演說中聲稱，南海的局勢總體穩定，但卻有「個別國家」毀棄雙邊的約定，配合外部勢力在亞太地區部署中程導彈，嚴重破壞地區的安全穩定，是「違反東盟憲章精神」的行為。\n\n莊嘉穎對此特別強調，這番言論中錯誤的解讀了「東協憲章」，是中方慣用陳述「不準確資訊」的一個最新案例。他表示，菲律賓部署中程飛彈及強化與美國軍事合作，並沒有違反東協憲章，事實上，該憲章將國家主權和自主權放在首位，將尊重各國在自身防禦和組成聯盟的自主決定。\n\n他告訴DW，「這種誤導東協憲章及其他類似條約的努力，利用了人們對這些現存條約和協議缺乏了解的情況。這是中國一直在做的事情，董軍也強化了這個做法。」\n\n今年論壇的另一個重頭戲，則是烏克蘭總統澤倫斯基的到訪及壓軸演說。他在談話中表示，預計於6月展開的一場討論俄羅斯侵烏的和平峰會，目前已有106個國家及組織登記出席，但部分國家領袖尚未表達支持，令人失望。\n\n這場和平峰會將在瑞士舉行，但中國外交部於5月31日以俄國未受邀為由，拒絕出席這場峰會，認為相關安排與中方要求仍有明顯差距。\n\n澤倫斯基在會後的場邊記者會上，向法新社指出中國正努力阻止各國出席和平峰會，，並稱「俄國利用中國在區域的影響力，利用中國的外交官與一切手段，來擾亂這次的和平峰會。非常遺憾，也非常不幸，像是中國這麼強大的國家，也甘於當成普亭的工具」。\n\n他也罕見對中國強硬表態，指北京施壓要其他國家也不要出席峰會，「不只是在支持俄國，基本上也是在支持戰爭。」\n\n每年的香格里拉對話是由英國國際戰略研究所（International Institute of Strategic Studies，IISS）舉辦，俄羅斯自2022年入侵烏克蘭以來，就沒有參加過這個高峰會談。\n\n莊嘉穎表示，澤倫斯基前往亞洲表明「他意識到烏克蘭需要多樣化其支持來源，以減少在其他地方碰到的阻礙」，但他認為北京目前還沒有打算在對烏立場上做出改變。\n\n© 2024年德國之聲版權聲明：本文所有內容受到著作權法保護，如無德國之聲特別授權，不得擅自使用。任何不當行為都將導致追償，並受到刑事追究。",

He also reiterated China's neutral stance on the Ukraine conflict and called for a ceasefire in the Israel-Palestine conflict.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a rare participant, accused China of supporting Russia's war efforts by discouraging attendance at a peace summit.

        "body": "（德國之聲中文網）新加坡「香格裡拉對話」週日（6月2日）落幕，這場亞洲高級安全論壇的鎂光燈，高度聚焦在中美之間的大國角力，以及北京在台海、南海的軍事行為。其中作為壓軸講者的烏克蘭總統澤倫斯基（Volodymyr Zelenskyy），也罕見對中國提出指控。\n\n論壇期間，美國國防部長奧斯汀（Lloyd Austin）與中國新任防長董軍分別發表了約半小時的演說，並開放台下的與會者提問。5月31日，兩人也在峰會前舉辦雙邊會晤，交流長達75分鐘，並在事後的聲明稿及記者會中表示，中美雙方都同意維持軍事溝通的重要性。\n\n國際危機組織（ICG）資深中國問題專家蕭嫣然（Amanda Hsiao）告訴DW，這是中美關係走在正確方向的第一步，因為在中美角力的情況下，誤讀對方意圖的可能性非常高，而儘管分歧仍存在，「至少我們之間有一套定期的溝通機制」。\n\n然而在許多核心區域安全議題上，雙方各說各話的情況仍顯而易見。中國防長面對其他國家代表提出有關南海、烏克蘭、加薩走廊的具體安全問題時，也被認為避而不答。\n\n蕭嫣然表示，董軍沒有直接回應關於中國意圖的「非常具體的問題」，「中國在傳遞訊息時，向來是對區域的關切充耳不聞（tone-deaf）。他所傳遞的訊息，實際上迴避了該地區許多政府對安全的真實關切」。\n\n董軍2日發表「中國的全球安全觀」演說時表示，「現在大家都很關心中美兩軍關係」，因兩軍關係的穩定，事關全球安全穩定，而中美兩軍之間，「正因為有分歧所以才要多交流，即使道不同，也不能搞對抗」。\n\n同時他也強調，要找到「兩軍正確的相處之道」須仰賴美中雙方的努力。在此論調上，董軍稱中方是負責任、始終秉持開放合作的大國，並指涉美方是「搞集團對抗」造成亞太地區情勢緊張的「外部勢力」。\n\n蕭嫣然分析，董軍試圖將中國描繪成亞太地區的「代言人」，其目的是呼籲地區政府不要站在美國一邊。她告訴DW中國正在推動的論述是，「中國有和平意圖，且問題不在中國，而在美國。」在當前的區域戰爭中，董軍也重申中國在烏克蘭問題上將保持「中立」、不站邊、不供武，並「秉持公正立場」呼籲巴以沖突停火。\n\n新加坡國立大學政治系副教授莊嘉穎則表示，中方試圖營造一種印象，即把台灣、美國和菲律賓描繪成「麻煩製造者」，認為他們旨在製造分裂，是「威脅現有世界秩序的不穩定因素」。\n\n然而在董軍演說結束後，來自韓國的代表發言表示，多數亞太地區的國家都認為，中方實際所作所為，與其所言以「和平發展道路」為核心的區域安全決策「完全相反」。蕭嫣然告訴DW，「中國僅僅聲稱擁有和平意圖已經不夠了」，現今國際社會「已經（對中國）沒有足夠的信任來支撐這一說法」。\n\n在台海議題上，奧斯汀重申美方支持台海維持現狀，並強調區域的爭端與分歧須透過對話而非脅迫或衝突來解決，「當然也不是透過所謂的懲罰」。這番言論雖未指名道姓，但被認為是明顯在抨擊中國。\n\n原因是北京在峰會前夕在台灣周邊展開軍演。當時國台辦發言指，這是對台灣新任總統賴清德5月20日就職演說「謀獨挑釁的堅決懲戒」，也是對「外部勢力縱容支持台獨、干涉中國內政」的嚴厲警告。\n\n這與中國防長在論壇上的台海論述一致。董軍借國際場合批評台灣執政黨民進黨「大搞漸進式台獨」，「頑固推行『去中國化』，妄圖割裂兩岸社會、歷史文化聯繫、數典忘祖的分裂言論荒謬而狂妄，必將被釘在歷史的恥辱柱上」。\n\n同時中方也指控各國正在以「切香腸」方式不斷虛化掏空「一中原則」，「誰膽敢把台灣從中國分裂出去，必將粉身碎骨、自取滅亡。」\n\n在一系列對台言論上，蕭嫣然認為中方使用的語言是比以往「尖銳」，而其目的是試圖警告美國與台灣，並「促使華盛頓向台北提出緩和立場的訊號。」\n\n莊嘉穎則認為，中國透過論壇釋放出「不會放棄對台灣施壓」的信號。「部分原因是北京認為目前沒有太多好的替代方案。如果要加強侵略性，他們早就這麼做了。他們也不想升級衝突，但發現自己不能退讓。所以唯一能做的就是使用憤怒的言語。」\n\n隨後在董軍演說後的問答階段，共有包含台灣、南海、俄烏戰爭及緬甸戰亂等多道提問，但董軍一開始只針對台灣議題高談闊論，遭主持人連續打斷，請他針對其他議題簡短作答。\n\n其中一次遭打斷時，董軍表示：「我想先把台灣議題講完，因為這是我們核心利益的核心問題。」並稱中方對任何「台獨的極端情景準備非常充分、也有能力」，但中國作為一個大國，堅持還是走和平統一的道路，因此奉勸「台獨份子」深入了解《反國家分裂法》的內容，以免觸法。\n\n對此，莊嘉穎認為董軍此舉一來是為了迴避其他問題，因為「談論台灣對他來說是最安全的一個話題。他知道該說些什麼，他不會出錯」，二來是為了極力孤立台灣，進一步將台灣賴清德政府描繪成「倔強、危險、冒進」的形象。\n\n相較上一屆香格裡拉論壇，前中國防長李尚福未與奧斯汀會晤，兩人僅有握手寒暄，這一次中美交流顯然增多。然而今年論壇邀請到菲國總統小馬科斯（Ferdinand Marcos Jr.）作為開場演說嘉賓，在關鍵的南海議題上，中美仍存在重大分歧。\n\n小馬科斯在演說中強調，任何解決南海爭議的方式都必須以國際法為基礎，並表示在主權問題上「菲律賓人不會屈服」。他在現場被問及，若中國在南海使用水砲造成菲國人員死傷，這是否將被視為跨越紅線。他答道若中方蓄意造成菲方軍人或公民死亡，「這已非常非常接近我們所定義的戰爭行為」。\n\n隨後奧斯汀也表態認同小馬科斯的演說內容，強調「每個國家，無論大小，都有權享有自己的海洋資源，並在國際法允許的任何地方自由航行和作業」。\n\n菲律賓與中國近期因南海主權之爭頻頻發生海上爭端，菲方並開始強化與澳洲、美國、日本的國防合作。隨著情勢升溫，南海已被視為亞太地區的另一個可能引爆衝突的導火線。\n\n但董軍在演說中聲稱，南海的局勢總體穩定，但卻有「個別國家」毀棄雙邊的約定，配合外部勢力在亞太地區部署中程導彈，嚴重破壞地區的安全穩定，是「違反東盟憲章精神」的行為。\n\n莊嘉穎對此特別強調，這番言論中錯誤的解讀了「東協憲章」，是中方慣用陳述「不準確資訊」的一個最新案例。他表示，菲律賓部署中程飛彈及強化與美國軍事合作，並沒有違反東協憲章，事實上，該憲章將國家主權和自主權放在首位，將尊重各國在自身防禦和組成聯盟的自主決定。\n\n他告訴DW，「這種誤導東協憲章及其他類似條約的努力，利用了人們對這些現存條約和協議缺乏了解的情況。這是中國一直在做的事情，董軍也強化了這個做法。」\n\n今年論壇的另一個重頭戲，則是烏克蘭總統澤倫斯基的到訪及壓軸演說。他在談話中表示，預計於6月展開的一場討論俄羅斯侵烏的和平峰會，目前已有106個國家及組織登記出席，但部分國家領袖尚未表達支持，令人失望。\n\n這場和平峰會將在瑞士舉行，但中國外交部於5月31日以俄國未受邀為由，拒絕出席這場峰會，認為相關安排與中方要求仍有明顯差距。\n\n澤倫斯基在會後的場邊記者會上，向法新社指出中國正努力阻止各國出席和平峰會，，並稱「俄國利用中國在區域的影響力，利用中國的外交官與一切手段，來擾亂這次的和平峰會。非常遺憾，也非常不幸，像是中國這麼強大的國家，也甘於當成普丁的工具」。\n\n他也罕見對中國強硬表態，指北京施壓要其他國家也不要出席峰會，「不只是在支持俄國，基本上也是在支持戰爭。」\n\n每年的香格裡拉對話是由英國國際戰略研究所（International Institute of Strategic Studies，IISS）舉辦，俄羅斯自2022年入侵烏克蘭以來，就沒有參加過這個高峰會談。\n\n莊嘉穎表示，澤倫斯基前往亞洲表明「他意識到烏克蘭需要多樣化其支持來源，以減少在其他地方碰到的阻礙」，但他認為北京目前還沒有打算在對烏立場上做出改變。\n\n© 2024年德國之聲版權聲明：本文所有內容受到著作權法保護，如無德國之聲特別授權，不得擅自使用。任何不當行為都將導致追償，並受到刑事追究。",

The forum highlighted the strategic rivalry between the US and China, focusing on Beijing's military actions in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. Key speakers included US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and China's new Defense Minister Li Shangfu, who both emphasized the importance of maintaining military communication despite ongoing disputes.\n\nExperts noted that while the US and China agreed on the need for dialogue, significant differences remained on core security issues. China's responses to questions about regional security concerns were seen as evasive, with Li Shangfu avoiding direct answers on topics like the South China Sea and Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made a rare appearance, accusing China of undermining a planned peace summit on the Russia-Ukraine conflict by pressuring countries not to attend. He criticized China for supporting Russia's war efforts.\n\nThe forum also featured Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who stressed the importance of international law in resolving South China Sea disputes. The Philippines has been strengthening defense ties with the US, Australia, and Japan amid rising tensions with China.\n\nOverall, the forum underscored the deepening geopolitical divides in the Asia-Pacific region, with China portraying itself as a peaceful power while being accused of aggressive actions by other nations."

        "title": "菲方人员拿枪指中国海警，当年越南开枪的后果，看来马科斯不清楚",
        "body": "在今年新加坡香格里拉对话会期间，菲律宾总统马科斯可以说屡被\"打脸\"，不仅不敢公开回应我国记者、解放军将领的质问，就连他那段阴阳怪气暗示我国\"破坏南海和平繁荣愿景\"的谎言也被戳穿。\n\n据环球网报道，2日我国媒体发布了一段中国海警在仁爱礁执法的现场视频，时间拍摄于5月19日，当时菲律宾试图向仁爱礁非法\"坐滩\"军舰空投补给，我国海警依法采取行动时，菲船人员竟公然持枪指向中方巡逻艇。\n\n尽管视频中菲方人员没有开枪，但其枪口指向人的行为无疑对我国海警执法人员的生命安全构成威胁，同时也再次证明了南海无法风平浪静的责任，完全在于菲律宾。\n\n甚至可以说，当时\"马德雷山\"号上持枪指向我国海警的菲方人员，一如今天在南海问题上频繁碰瓷的菲律宾政府，仗着怀里揣了一把枪，就在美国的唆使下对着中国比比划划，丝毫没有认识到这么做的危险性。\n\n在不久前举行的新加坡香格里拉对话会上，菲律宾总统马科斯还大言不惭地宣称，任何菲律宾人在南海被\"故意杀害\"，都会被视为战争行为，菲律宾及其盟友将会采取相应行动。\n\n然而，铁一般的事实证明，南海和平稳定的破坏者，自始至终都是菲律宾自己。\n\n仁爱礁上的那艘破烂军舰从1999年非法\"坐滩\"至今，期间菲方曾多次承诺会尽快拖船但却屡屡食言，到了马科斯上台后，菲律宾政府干脆否认了拖船承诺的存在，甚至就连中菲商量好的仁爱礁运补协议也言而无信咽了回去。\n\n这种扭头就反悔的做法，堪称国家交往间的奇葩，其厚颜无耻程度也只有美国政府能相提并论，而且更微妙的是，马科斯还被普遍认为是美国扶植的代理人，这种睁着眼说瞎话的本事也算是深得美国真传了。\n\n在今年香格里拉对话会上，马科斯那句所谓的\"美国对地区安全至关重要\"，几乎等同于挑明了他就是替美国在南海兴风作浪的马前卒，南海只有变得越混乱，像马科斯这样的\"买办\"政客在美国政府面前才更有利用价值。\n\n然而，\"买办\"政客最大的毛病就是目光短浅。如今菲律宾对我国南海岛礁的碰瓷行径，尤其是菲方人员持枪指向我国海警的姿态，像极了30多年前的越南，但越南当初在南海挑衅过中国后是什么下场，马科斯似乎根本不清楚。\n\n1988年越南海军无视我国警告强行登上赤瓜礁，并向岛上中方人员开火，我军战士随即进行自卫还击，击沉越军舰艇2艘、重伤1艘并俘虏9人，越军人员死伤超过300人，而我国方面仅1人受伤。\n\n所以，如今菲律宾方面一直存在某种错觉，认为仗着在《美菲共同防御条约》保护下可以胡来，中国一定不敢升级局势。然而，越南当年的下场证明，菲律宾如果还抱着这种天真的想法，那就错得相当离谱。\n\n中国的忍耐与克制从来不是无限的。自去年以来，菲律宾多次在仁爱礁、黄岩岛等南海岛礁制造事端，而且一次比一次激进，如今甚至快发展为妄图侵占我国南沙仙宾礁的地步。\n\n所以，中国绝不会任凭菲律宾在南海胡作非为。我国海警\"3号令\"将于6月15日生效，新规将赋予海警执法人员拘留外国非法入境人员的权力，最长拘留时间可达60天。\n\n如今这起菲方人员持枪指向我国海警的事件，已经充分暴露出现在菲律宾正处于擦枪走火的悬崖边缘，只要菲律宾胆敢再向前迈出一步，就会立刻坠入深渊。",

A video released by Chinese media on June 2 shows an incident on May 19 where Philippine personnel pointed guns at Chinese coast guard officers during a confrontation at Ren'ai Reef. Although no shots were fired, this act was seen as a threat to Chinese personnel and highlighted the Philippines' role in destabilizing the South China Sea.\n\nThe Philippines has a history of broken promises regarding the removal of a grounded warship at Ren'ai Reef, with the current government under Marcos denying previous commitments. Marcos, perceived as a U.S. proxy, has been accused of escalating tensions in the region, mirroring past provocations by Vietnam, which led to a deadly conflict in 1988.\n\nChina has warned that its patience is not unlimited and has introduced new regulations empowering its coast guard to detain foreign intruders for up to 60 days, effective June 15. The recent incident with Philippine personnel has brought the situation to a critical point, with China cautioning that any further provocations could lead to severe consequences."

        "title": "国际锐评丨起底美国搅局南海的\"航行自由\"真相",
        "body": "国际锐评丨起底美国搅局南海的\"航行自由\"真相\n\n\"航行不是'横行'，自由不能妄为。\"近日，在中国国防部的记者会上，发言人针对美国国防部发布2023财年\"航行自由\"报告的答问一针见血。根据该报告，美方2023财年共挑战包括中国在内的17个国家或地区的29项\"过度海洋主张\"。\n\n近年来，\"航行自由\"成了美方四处炫耀武力、搞联合巡航军演的常用借口。去年至今，菲律宾频频侵闯中国仁爱礁、黄岩岛海域；美日菲举行首次三边峰会，就南海问题无理攻击中国......作为事件的幕后推手，美方屡次搬出\"航行自由\"的说辞。\n\n那么，\"航行自由\"到底指的是什么？美式\"航行自由\"与国际法认可的\"航行自由\"有什么不同？在美方这个核心海洋主张背后，有哪些企图？不妨一一来看。\n\n此\"航行自由\"非彼\"航行自由\"\n\n虽然都叫航行自由，但《联合国海洋法公约》（以下简称《公约》）里的\"航行自由\"与美国口中\"航行自由\"根本就不是一回事。前者出发点是维护各国应享有的公平海洋权益，维护全球海洋秩序；后者出发点则是保障美国的军事外交利益，维护美国海洋霸权。\n\n翻开《公约》，它对领海、专属经济区、公海等海域规定了相应的航行制度。领海宽度不超过12海里，专属经济区宽度不超过200海里，公海是指不包括在国家专属经济区、领海或内水或群岛国的群岛水域以内的全部海域。\n\n按照《公约》，外国船舶在领海享有无害通过，但不得损害沿海国的和平、良好秩序或安全；在专属经济区享有航行自由，但须顾及沿海国对自然资源的主权权利以及对海洋科考、环保等事项的管辖权；各方在公海享有航行自由，但须符合\"公海应只用于和平目的\"等要求。值得注意的是，《公约》规定了沿海国的保护权，比如沿海国可以采取适当步骤防止非无害通过；沿海国可以要求不遵守其国内法的外国军舰立即离开领海。\n\n那么美国口中的\"航行自由\"又是怎么回事呢？可谓简单粗暴。在美国眼中，\"领海之外即公海\"，为此它还独创了\"国际水域\"这个概念。在美国的概念和行为中，别说他国200海里专属经济区内美军舰可以绝对自由地航行，即便是沿海国12海里之内，它也能以无害通过之名、\"不受国家的不合法限制\"通行。\n\n二者区别很明显。打个比方，《公约》规定的航行自由就如同在一个村子里，每家每户住房之外有院子，院子之外是种着瓜果蔬菜的菜园子。外来者通过菜园子需要告知主人，院子更是不能随便踏入。然而美国不仅要随便通过菜园子，更想不打招呼就进院子。在这种绝对自由的逻辑之下，美国军舰时常未经申请或通报强行进入他国管辖的海域，由此带来的危险事件更是不胜枚举。\n\n可见，此\"航行自由\"非彼\"航行自由\"，两者有着本质区别。美国没有加入《联合国海洋法公约》，却利用 \"航行自由行动\"挑战他国所谓\"过度海洋主张\"，实质是以美式\"家法帮规\"来维系全球海洋霸权。\n\n从\"旁观\"到\"下场\"，霸权之手搅乱南海\n\n美国口口声声说，\"航行自由行动\"是为了保障海上通道安全和商业繁荣，但事实真的如此吗？\n\n像美国国防部最近发布的\"航行自由\"报告，从1991年开始，基本每年都会定期发布。据统计，截至2022年，美国已累计对60多个国家实施了600多次\"航行自由行动\"，挑战超过700项所谓\"过度海洋主张\"。\n\n有学者做过研究，在2000年之前，亚太地区还不是美国\"航行自由行动\"的最主要目标区。但2000年后，亚太地区的角色显著上升。\n\n《国际锐评》梳理公开资料发现：从1991到2006年的15年里，美国国防部只在3个财年的\"航行自由\"报告中\"点名\"了中国（分别是1992、1993、1994财年），理由是 \"美方不认可其军舰进入中国领海需事先通报\"。但从2007年开始，情况出现了变化。自那一年起，中国持续成为美国实施\"航行自由行动\"的目标国。据中国智库\"南海战略态势感知计划\"统计，2015 -- 2022年，美方针对中国南海岛礁的\"航行自由行动\"总体呈现持续增加趋势，共计39次。\n\n为什么会有这样的变化？这与美国把全球战略重心调整至亚太、对中国战略疑虑持续加深、菲律宾与中国南海主权争端不断升温等因素密切相关。如果回顾冷战结束后美国的对外政策，可以清楚看到美国南海政策的转变轨迹。\n\n上世纪90年代初，美方对南海问题的基本政策是，对各方领土要求的合法性不持立场，强调用和平手段解决领土纠纷，同时关注南海的航行自由。\n\n随着奥巴马政府2009年、2012年相继提出\"重返亚太\"和\"亚太再平衡\"战略，美国南海政策发生了实质性转变 -- -- 从过往的\"观察者\"变成\"干预者\"，开始借南海问题对中国进行牵制。\n\n奥巴马第二任期内，美方要求中国停止在南海填海造地，鼓动菲律宾将南海争端提交国际仲裁，推动南海问题国际化与多边化。同时积极向越南、菲律宾等国提供外交帮助和军事支持，甚至直接派遣飞机和舰船进入南海争议地区。\n\n2017年特朗普政府上台后，美方针对中国的\"航行自由行动\"明显增多：美海军和空军频频到南海地区挑衅，美方还拉拢西方盟友共同到南海宣示\"航行自由\"，在南海周边举行联合军事演习。\n\n《国际锐评》梳理发现，2015年5月至2017年5月，美舰机侵犯中国南海主权的事件密集发生，其中一些节点耐人寻味。比如，2016年10月，美\"迪凯特\"号驱逐舰擅自进入中国西沙领海，正值菲律宾时任总统杜特尔特对中国访问。当时，中菲关系全面恢复并且签署了一系列合作协议。\n\n2023年，随着菲律宾频频在南海挑衅滋事，美军加大了在南海及周边地区的军事行动。据\"南海战略态势感知计划\"发布的报告，过去一年美航母打击群和两栖戒备群大型编队8次进入南海，停留时间、训练强度和针对性都显著增强；至少有11艘攻击核潜艇和2艘战略导弹核潜艇先后出现在南海及周边海域。\n\n可见，华盛顿容不得南海风平浪静，刻意在本地区制造紧张。正如专家所说，美国的\"航行自由行动\"与其标榜的维护国际航道安全和海上贸易繁荣毫不相关，而是推进美国全球战略、维护美国安全利益的军事工具。\n\n美式舆论战试图美化\"航行自由\"\n\n除了军事行动、外交发声，美国还针对南海地区发动舆论战，以给\"航行自由行动\"披上\"合理\"的外衣。\n\n2022年6月菲律宾本届政府上台后，美国媒体加大了对南海局势的炒作。《国际锐评》整理了美媒2020年1月以来有关南海局势的报道。以《纽约时报》为例，在菲新政府上台前月均报道量为3.26篇，在菲新政府上台后月均报道量上涨了42%。把数据进一步细化发现，菲律宾每次对中国发动挑衅后，《纽约时报》都会跟风炒作。\n\n为了体现所谓\"现场报道\"，美国记者不止一次乘坐菲律宾海警船，拍摄中菲船只对抗的影像，甚至化身为演员。2023年，《纽约时报》发布了一篇记者\"硬闯\"中国南海美济岛遭到中国海军驱离的长篇报道。这个记者把自己描述得可怜兮兮，\"控诉\"中国海军不讲道理。而真实情况是，他乘坐的船只已经冲到美济岛2海里领海线内了！\n\n美国空军军官本杰明·戈伊里戈尔扎里曾在一场论坛中坦言，菲律宾海警队的策略就是\"菲船只配备记者，记录与中方冲突，展示中国的'欺凌行为'\"。可见，这么做就是想用所谓记者视角，把中方正当合法的维权行动歪曲成\"以大欺小\"、把挑衅滋事的菲律宾塑造成\"受害者\"，颠倒黑白，让美国的\"航行自由\"合理化。\n\n这场舆论战里，还有个兴风作浪的常客 -- -- 美国智库，比如战略与国际研究中心（CSIS）旗下的\"亚洲海事透明倡议\"（AMTI）。\n\n近期，AMTI发布了一份所谓南海\"环境威胁\"的报告，无端指责中国破坏南海环境，被多家美媒转载。此前，该机构发布的各式各样报告频繁出现在美媒关于南海的报道中。AMTI网站显示，它得到了来自美国的资金支持，被舆论比作美国政府在南海问题上操纵公众舆论的\"影子工具\"。而在美国，像AMTI这样的智库还有很多。\n\n美媒铺天盖地炒作、记者捏造事实表演、智库报告无中生有 -- -- 这番美式舆论战操作，正在南海地区一次又一次上演。\n\n一位东南亚渔民曾给《南华早报》写过这样一封信，\"让我正言相告：美国正在中国的视线内玩火。如果这种状况失去控制，整个地区都将遭受损失。我们为什么要为美国的错误行为承受代价？任何一个有独立思考能力的人，看到美国一再把中国塑造为海洋争端中唯一的'坏孩子'，难道不会感到不对劲？\"\n\n西方研究所研究员格雷格·奥斯汀也坦率指出，所谓中国在南海行为对商业航运构成威胁，是五角大楼撒下的一个弥天大谎。事实上，在中国和东盟共同努力下，南海航行自由一直没有问题。美国以\"航行自由\"之名推行\"航行霸权\"，才是造成海空安全风险的根源。",

        "summary": "The article critically examines the United States' \"freedom of navigation\" operations in the South China Sea, arguing that the U.S. uses this concept to assert its maritime dominance rather than uphold international law. Key points include:\n\n1. **U.S. Actions and Justifications**: The U.S. Department of Defense's 2023 report claims to challenge \"excessive maritime claims\" by 17 countries, including China. The U.S. frequently uses \"freedom of navigation\" as a pretext for military operations and joint exercises in the region.\n\n2. **Differences in Interpretation**: The article contrasts the U.S. interpretation of \"freedom of navigation\" with that of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). While UNCLOS aims to protect equitable maritime rights and global order, the U.S. interpretation prioritizes its military and diplomatic interests.\n\n3. **Historical Context**: The U.S. has increasingly targeted the Asia-Pacific region with its \"freedom of navigation\" operations since 2000, particularly focusing on China. This shift aligns with broader U.S. strategic interests in the region and rising tensions over South China Sea disputes.\n\n4. **Military and Diplomatic Maneuvers**: The U.S. has escalated its military presence and support for regional allies like the Philippines, often conducting operations without notifying coastal states, leading to numerous dangerous incidents.\n\n5. **Media and Public Perception**: The U.S. also engages in a media campaign to justify its actions, often portraying China as the aggressor. American media and think tanks, such as the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), play significant roles in shaping public opinion.\n\n6. **Regional Impact**: The article argues that U.S. actions destabilize the region, contradicting its stated goal of ensuring maritime safety and commercial prosperity. It suggests that the true motive is to maintain U.S. global strategic dominance.\n\nThe article concludes that the U.S.'s approach to \"freedom of navigation\" is a guise for maritime hegemony, posing risks to regional stability and security."

        "title": "香格里拉對話：中國防長對美警告「3個不允許」 哲連斯基現身籲「阻止普京」",
        "body": "在新加坡一年一度的各國軍事高層對話中，中國嚴詞警告美國與「台獨」，烏克蘭總統則呼籲國際社會提供更多支持。\n\n中國承認與美國重啟軍事交流的重要性，並指責華盛頓對台灣、菲律賓的支持製造摩擦。2日在英國智庫國際戰略研究所（IISS）主辦的新加坡「香格里拉對話」亞洲安全會議上，中國國防部長董軍的演講與問答環節中發出警告，中國不允許霸權主義、強權政治損害亞太，不允許把地緣衝突、冷戰熱戰引入地區，不允許任何國家、任何勢力在這裡生戰生亂。\n\n董軍表示，中國對與美軍的交流與合作持開放態度，但這需要雙方共同努力。他重申中國「和平統一」台灣的目標，但警告台灣的「分離主義分子」和外部勢力正在侵蝕這一前景。他威脅稱，中國將以及時、堅決有力的作為扼止「台獨」，確保其圖謀永無得逞之日，「誰膽敢把台灣從中國分裂出去，必將粉身碎骨、自取滅亡」。\n\n這是董軍首次以中國國防部長身分在「香格里拉對話」（Shangri-La Dialogue）亮相，他去年年底接替前任的李尚福擔任這一職位。此次對話也為各國提供了一個難得的機會，能夠聽取中國高級軍事領導人的見解並向其提問。在問答環節中，與會代表們針對台灣和南海爭議問題，向董軍提出了多項問題。董軍對台灣問題尤為關注，在主持人的提示下才回應其他議題。\n\n他指責外國勢力干涉「中國內政問題」與美國對台軍售等支持舉措。董軍表示：「他們正在向台灣出售大量武器，這種行為向台獨勢力發出了非常錯誤的信號，使他們變得更加挑釁。我們很清楚，外國勢力的真正目的是利用台灣來遏制中國。」\n\n會議召開之際，印太地區的安全局勢緊張。董軍將中國描述為良善的大國，稱解放軍從不恃強凌弱。然而，中國周邊國家對美中競爭和北京擴張軍事影響力以佔領爭議領土表示擔憂。儘管海牙常設仲裁庭在2016年裁定中國對南海的主張「沒有法律依據」，但中國仍聲稱幾乎整個南海屬於自己。中國的船隻和飛機依然在南海國際法允許的海空域內對其他國家進行巡邏和攻擊。\n\n董軍還指責「某個東南亞國家」在主權存議島嶼上挑起事端，並暗示美國是背後真正的罪魁禍首。顯然，這是針對菲律賓的指控。近期，中菲兩國在南海對峙情勢十分緊張，從雷射筆使菲律賓船員暫時失明到發射水砲攻擊菲律賓船隻，使菲律賓當局與民間對中國相當不滿。\n\n董軍在向與會代表發言時警告道：「個別國家在外部勢力煽動下，背棄雙邊協議、違背承諾，有預謀地挑起事端。中國在應對這些挑釁時表現出了足夠的克制，但這種克制也是有限度的。」此前，菲律賓總統小馬可仕（Ferdinand Marcos Jr.）在同一場合發表演講，強烈表達了對中國的立場：「我們將盡一切努力保護我們的主權。」\n\n董軍的警告反映出美中兩國對一些區域問題的立場仍然存在嚴重分歧。根據美國有線電視新聞網（CNN）報導，IISS日本所長兼地緣經濟與戰略主任沃德（Robert Ward）指出，董軍的發言內容比之前參與該會議的中國國防部長更加尖銳。他表示：「亞洲的戰略環境確實變得更加緊張，今天中國國防部長的演講明顯展現了這一點，今年的語氣比去年強硬得多。」\n\n然而，一位美國官員匿名表示，董軍的演講並未提出任何新穎的內容。過去3年來，每年都有不同的中國國防高層參加「香格里拉對話」，他們的講話每次都與解放軍在該地區的實際行動不符，今年也不例外。\n\n就在董軍發表演說的前一天，美國國防部長奧斯丁（Lloyd Austin）告訴各國代表，美國正積極應對烏克蘭的安全援助和加薩戰爭，但印太地區仍然是美國的一個關注重點。奧斯丁表示：「讓我清楚地說，只有亞洲安全，美國才能安全。」\n\n董軍與奧斯丁也在「香格里拉對話」期間會晤。這是自2022年時任美國眾議院議長裴洛西（Nancy Pelosi）訪台、美中軍方停止對話以來，雙方國防高級官員之間的首次面對面會晤。\n\n烏克蘭總統哲連斯基（Volodymyr Zelenskyy）1日突然現身「香格里拉對話」，並會見各國政策制定者，尋求安全協助與對6月中旬於瑞士登場的烏克蘭和平峰會的支持。\n\n哲連斯基在演講和問答環節中表示，已有106個國家和組織簽署了參加烏克蘭和平高峰會的協議，但他指出，令人失望的是，一些世界領導人尚未表示支持。他認為俄羅斯試圖破壞和平努力，強調只有堅持不懈的外交才能結束這場衝突，並呼籲「世界必須阻止普京（Vladimir Putin）」。\n\n自2022年入侵烏克蘭以來，俄羅斯就沒有參加「香格里拉對話」。董軍在演講中向與會代表表明，中國一向保持謹慎態度，並未支持俄羅斯或烏克蘭任一方。他強調：「在烏克蘭危機中，中方始終秉持負責任的態度，積極勸和促談，並未向任何衝突方提供武器，嚴格管控軍民兩用物資的出口。」此外，他指出：「我們絕不幹遞刀拱火的事，我們堅定支持和平與對話。」",

        "summary": "At the annual Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, Chinese Defense Minister Li Shangfu issued stern warnings to the U.S. and Taiwan independence advocates, emphasizing three \"unallowables\": no hegemony or power politics in the Asia-Pacific, no regional conflicts or wars, and no external forces causing instability. Li stressed China's openness to military exchanges with the U.S. but criticized American support for Taiwan and the Philippines, which he claimed exacerbates tensions. He reiterated China's goal of peaceful reunification with Taiwan but warned against separatist actions.\n\nThis was Li's first appearance at the dialogue as China's Defense Minister, succeeding Wei Fenghe. The event allowed international representatives to question him, particularly on Taiwan and the South China Sea disputes. Li accused foreign interference in China's internal affairs and criticized U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.\n\nThe dialogue occurred amid heightened security tensions in the Indo-Pacific. Li portrayed China as a benign power, despite regional concerns over its military expansion. He accused an unnamed Southeast Asian country, implied to be the Philippines, of provoking disputes over contested islands, with the U.S. allegedly instigating these actions.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also made a surprise appearance, urging international support against Russian aggression and promoting the upcoming Ukraine peace summit. He highlighted the need for persistent diplomacy to end the conflict and called for global efforts to stop Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe event underscored ongoing U.S.-China tensions and differing regional security perspectives. Despite Li's strong rhetoric, a U.S. official noted the lack of new content in his speech. The dialogue also marked the first face-to-face meeting between U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Li since U.S.-China military talks were suspended in 2022."

        "body": "【大纪元2024年06月02日讯】（大纪元记者林燕报导）菲律宾总统费迪南德·小马科斯（Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s）在香格里拉对话会上，遇到中共军方战狼少将徐辉挑衅性提问。两人在南海问题上进行激烈交锋。\n\n周五（5月31日），小马科斯获邀在新加坡香格里拉对话会上发表主题演讲，中共国防大学国际防务研究学院院长徐辉率先第一个向他发问（跳转视频）。\n\n首先，徐辉没有按常规在麦克风前进行自我介绍，而是先对\"东盟中心地位\"发表了一通长篇序言（长1分半钟）。\n\n在主办方英国国际防务研究学院（IISS）执行主席约翰·奇普曼爵士（Sir John Chipman）敦促下，徐辉才向小马科斯就南海问题提问。\n\n他问道：\"在国际社会看来，菲律宾最近几天、最近一段时间的一些行为，听起来好像你们真的在意其它方的舒适度。自......（菲律宾的）殖民历史结束以来，是否存在破坏该地区长期、持久和平的风险。你对此有何评论？非常感谢。\"\n\n小马科斯回应说，菲律宾\"仍然恪守于\"东盟集团的各种\"原则\"。\n\n他随后重申了菲律宾对\"东盟中心地位\"的承诺，这是菲律宾外交政策的核心要素之一。\n\n《东盟宪章》第1条第15款说，\"维护东盟在开放、透明和包容的地区架构中的中心地位和积极作用，作为促进和外部伙伴关系与合作的主要动力\"。\n\n\"东盟中心地位\"此词被视为是一个政治术语，本身并无明确解释。中共通常将其解释为，东盟其它国必须扮演\"战略中间人\"，不得跟北京的任何大国敌手靠拢。\n\n小马科斯：南海已是世界问题 超出区域\n\n小马科斯回应徐辉的提问说：\"我无法猜测你指的是什么，如果你提到的或暗示的是菲律宾以某种方式撕毁我们在东盟中心地位方面达成的共识。答案恰恰相反。\"\n\n\"如果你仔细听我刚才的发言，你就会发现我们专注的正是东盟中心地位以及东盟诞生时所建立的原则。它包括东盟中心地位的理念，这是我们必须用来指导的东西。\"小马科斯接着说。\n\n\"而且我想，也正如我所说的，其中许多事情我们今天不想再提，但我们又不得不说。\"小马科斯补充说。\n\n\"我甚至可以说，现在不再存在区域问题了......我们必须让所有各方都参与讨论，因为现在不仅仅是东盟成员国才是利益相关方。而且很容易看出，事实上，整个世界都已成为我们地区和平与稳定的利益相关方。\"他说。\n\n徐辉的提问与中共官方对南海紧张局势的宣传如出一辙，它们指责菲律宾在南海制造麻烦，以及指责菲律宾听从其条约盟友美国的指挥。几乎每一个中国周边的邻国都被中共抱怨过，抱怨内容也几乎相同。\n\n香格里拉对话被认为是首屈一指的国防峰会，因为它的会议形式 -- -- 允许代表们更直接、更亲密地互动。它一直是亚太地区最高国防和安全官员坦诚、有时激烈交流的场所。\n\n小马科斯再次强调南海划分必须遵从国际法\n\n小马科斯在演讲中说，\"菲律宾在（南海）水域划定的界线并非来自我们的想像，而是来自国际法\"。\n\n他指的是菲律宾基于《联合国海洋法公约》，以及2016年仲裁裁决在南海的主权。2016年的仲裁认定北京对南海的全面主张非法。\n\n过去一年左右，中菲之间的紧张局势加剧，菲律宾在捍卫其在西菲律宾海（包括菲律宾专属经济区在内的南海部分海域）的权利和主张方面展现出坚毅的一面。\n\n双方在海上的对抗时常是紧张而危险的，中共动用海岸警卫队的船只，用水炮阻止菲律宾对仁爱礁搁浅舰艇的供给。\n\n小马科斯早些时候表示，他不想加剧南海本已紧张的局势，并声称，菲律宾政府永远不会像中共一样诉诸水炮来保卫领土。\n\n菲律宾外长称两国关系\"起伏不定\"，而中方外长则威胁，两国关系\"处在十字路口\"。\n\n随后，中共驻菲律宾外交官非法录音与菲律宾军事将领通话，在消息曝光后，两国关系进一步紧张。\n\n菲总统划红线 绝不容忍中共水炮致菲方人员死亡\n\n在香格里拉对话问答环节，菲律宾总统被问及，如果一名菲律宾水手因中共海警使用水炮袭击而丧生，是否会被视为越过红线。\n\n小马科斯没有拒绝这一假设提问。他说：\"如果发生一起事件，导致菲律宾军人死亡，无论是海警还是海军的一部分，菲律宾肯定都会提高应对水平。\"\n\n\"如果菲律宾人（不仅是军人或任何菲律宾公民）被蓄意杀害，我认为这非常、非常接近我们定义的战争行为。\"他补充道。\n\n他强调说，那将是一条红线。\n\n责任编辑：林妍#",

Xu's provocative question implied that the Philippines' recent actions might disrupt long-term peace in the region. Marcos reaffirmed the Philippines' commitment to ASEAN principles and emphasized that the South China Sea is a global issue, not just a regional one. He stressed that maritime boundaries should be determined by international law, referencing the 2016 arbitration ruling against China's claims. The dialogue highlighted ongoing tensions, with Marcos warning that any fatal incident involving Filipino personnel due to Chinese actions would be considered a serious escalation, potentially akin to an act of war."

China firmly opposes any actions that suggest Taiwan's separation from China and emphasizes its commitment to military readiness and national reunification. Additionally, China criticizes U.S. support for the Philippines, viewing it as a provocation. China insists on resolving disputes through dialogue but warns against misuse of goodwill and provocations.\n\nThe article concludes by urging the U.S. to align its actions with the consensus reached by the two nations' leaders, emphasizing the need for consistent and concrete actions in the military domain."

        "body": "中国于5月23日发动\"联合利剑-2024A\"围台军演，美国政府数度公开呼吁要求克制。军演落幕一周后，中国随即派出外交部副部长马朝旭赶赴美国，与美国副国务卿坎博等美方官员举行会谈。尽管中方的会后新闻稿重申台湾问题为美中关系\"红线\"的强硬立场，但马朝旭会后在对媒体说明时却未多谈台湾问题，而是强调美中关系正处于止跌企稳的关键期，双方会谈具建设性。\n\n据上报今天报道称，不过稍晚回到中国驻美大使馆，对其他媒体说明会谈内容时，马朝旭的谈话与在国务院外完全不同，特别提及自己在会谈中\"向美方强调\"，台湾问题是中美关系第一条不可逾越的红线。马朝旭更点名赖清德，抨击他的顽固坚持台独立场，\"充分暴露他的台独本性\"。\n\n该报称，军演后中国涉台高层升高对台施压，但涉外系统忙对美灭火。显示中国两面手法　军演吓台后赴美斡旋。\n\n在赖清德总统5月20日发表就职演说后，中国于23日宣布对台军演。美国在520前已数度呼吁中国克制，在中国宣布军演之后，美国再次利用不同场合批评中国不应以台湾的例行民主程序为借口采取胁迫行为。面对美方一再表态，中国则升高抨击强度，指控\"台美勾连\"才是破坏台海和平的主要原因。\n\n尽管外宣言论剑拔弩张，中国外交斡旋也同时快速推进。在军演结束后6天，马朝旭便火速飞抵美国，赶赴美国国务院，与坎贝尔（Kurt Campbell）等高阶官员举行长达数小时的会谈。而据现场媒体转述，会谈过程中，美国白宫国家安全会议中国暨台湾事务资深主任贝莎兰（Sarah Beran）亦现身国务院。\n\n据美国国务院在会后发布的会谈纪要，双方会谈内容以落实2023年11月的拜习会共识为主轴，包括双方加强对话机制，避免误判及冲突升高，尤其是重启军事对话，建立危机控管机制。\n\n而会谈最重要议题则为近日的台海情势及南海问题。如同其他美方官员在美中对话中的表态，坎博也向马朝旭强调了美国对近日中国在台海周边及台湾海峡的行动表达强烈关注，并认为这些行动侵蚀了数十年来维持此一区域和平稳定的现状。\n\n中国外交部也在会后发布新闻稿指出，双方会谈内容涵盖美中关系及共同关切的区域问题，\"会谈是建设性的\"。\n\n中方新闻稿不忘强调，台湾问题是美中关系\"第一条不可逾越的红线\"，也是两国关系最重要、最敏感、最具爆炸性的问题。马朝旭在新闻稿中表示，美国若真的希望台海和平稳定，就应该恪守\"一个中国原则\"和美中三项联合公报，兑现不支持台独的承诺。\n\n上报称，虽然官方新闻稿疾言厉色，对台湾议题态度强硬，但据会谈现场媒体转述，马朝旭在会谈后于美国国务院外对媒体发表短暂谈话，完全未谈及台湾，仅表示双方会谈具建设性，美中关系正处于止跌企稳的关键期，双方应落实去年11月拜习会共识，推动中美关系健康稳定向前发展。\n\n马朝旭在会谈后的短暂谈话未谈及台湾，但回中国驻美大使馆后开始抨击赖清德。\n\n中国外交系统在政策发言中出现\"内外有别\"的现象并不稀奇，值得注意的是，根据相关部门掌握情资，520后急剧升高对台施压的决定，系由中共中央涉台高层拍板，涉外系统的角色更倾向被动配合。\n\n据该报，尤其近来习近平积极在国际舞台曝光，中国涉外系统一方面配合高层路线转向的指令，为其打造\"和平\"的国际人设，同时更迫切推动美中关系修复。值此涉外系统所称的\"美中关系关键时刻\"，涉台高层下达对台湾文攻武吓的指令，再度引来美国关切，让涉外系统火速出面加强对美沟通。",

        "summary": "The article discusses China's recent military exercises around Taiwan, dubbed \"Joint Sword-2024A,\" which took place on May 23, 2023. The U.S. government repeatedly called for restraint during these exercises. A week after the drills, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu visited the U.S. to meet with Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell and other officials. Despite China's firm stance on Taiwan being a \"red line\" in U.S.-China relations, Ma emphasized the constructive nature of the talks and the critical period for stabilizing bilateral relations.\n\nHowever, Ma's tone shifted when he returned to the Chinese Embassy, where he reiterated Taiwan as a non-negotiable issue and criticized Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te for his pro-independence stance. This dual approach highlights China's strategy of military pressure on Taiwan while engaging diplomatically with the U.S.\n\nThe meetings aimed to implement the consensus from the November 2023 Biden-Xi summit, focusing on dialogue mechanisms to avoid misjudgments and conflicts, particularly in military communications. The U.S. expressed strong concerns over China's actions around Taiwan, which they believe undermine regional stability.\n\nChina's diplomatic efforts appear to be a balancing act between maintaining a hardline stance on Taiwan and seeking to stabilize U.S.-China relations. This dual approach reflects internal directives from China's top leadership, emphasizing both military pressure on Taiwan and diplomatic engagement with the U.S. to manage international perceptions and relations."

        "title": "玉渊谭天丨细节披露：中美防长谈了什么",
        "body": "玉渊谭天丨细节披露：中美防长谈了什么\n\n5月31日，中国国防部长董军同美国国防部长在\"香会\"进行了面对面会谈。\n\n在面对面会谈中，中国国防部长董军直接敦促美方切实纠正错误，具体是哪些错误？\n\n通过会场内外的细节，我们一窥究竟。\n\n关于本次中美防长会谈的时间，谭主了解到，会谈原定时间是1个小时，而双方实际会谈的时长达到了75分钟，比原定时间延长了15分钟。\n\n中美防长能面对面坐下来，首先得益于中美元首会晤之后，中美两军交流的逐步开展。\n\n军事科学院研究员童真告诉谭主，包括两军高层沟通、中美国防部工作会晤、中美海上军事安全磋商机制会议等中美军方各层级的交流机制，都已经恢复运转。\n\n这对于中美两军关系而言，无疑是一个新的开始。但是从\"止跌\"到\"企稳\"，中美两军还有很多待解的问题。\n\n美方首先要纠正的，是交流的认知与心态。\n\n要知道在去年同一时间，美军在希望与中国军方交流的情况下，仍派出一架侦察机，蓄意闯入我训练区域实施侦察干扰，并\"反咬一口\"，污蔑中方依法依规的处置是\"不专业拦截\"，试图把脏水泼给中国。\n\n这一次，美国没有再搞出什么\"意外事件\"，甚至才刚刚做完手术的美国国防部长奥斯汀，也还是如期赴约。\n\n不仅如此，美国媒体也早早放风美国防长要与中方会面的消息。从这个细节也能看出，美国跟中方进行军事交流的意愿更加迫切。\n\n值得注意的是，这份\"迫切\"背后，美国的心态中仍然包含着猜测和试探。\n\n对今年以来美国媒体涉及中美防长会晤的报道进行主题分析后，可以发现其中既包括巴以冲突、乌克兰危机等国际和地区问题，也包括台湾、南海等涉及中方核心利益的议题。\n\n继续深入分析可以发现，美国最常强调的问题是所谓的\"航行自由\"，以及美国对印太以及台湾海峡\"和平稳定\"的承诺依然坚定。\n\n在军事科学院战争研究院研究员曹延中看来，美方所谓的保持沟通，实质关切的还是中方在台湾、南海等问题上的处置方式，要求中方注意管控一线对峙的强度。\n\n说白了就是先摸清中方底线，窥探中方行动，好指导自己的下一步\"军事力量前沿部署\"。\n\n美方与中方在交流中的目的有所不同，有分歧是自然的。\n\n在中美两军防长会谈后的中方新闻发布会上，法新社等国际媒体的记者也很关心在此背景下，会谈是否达到了中方想要的效果？\n\n用中国国防部新闻发言人吴谦的话来说，可以分两层看。\n\n第一层是，此次中美防长会谈效果是好的，双方将继续保持沟通。\n\n确实，全世界热爱和平的人，应该没有人会否认中美两军关系的稳定，有利于全世界的稳定。\n\n第二层是，中美两军之间的高层沟通和交流是非常重要的，但同时也不可能期待双方仅仅通过一次会谈就解决中美两军之间存在的所有问题。\n\n中美两军之间仍然存在很多分歧，但正像军事科学院原副院长何雷所说，面对面会谈给中方重申在重大问题上的原则立场提供了契机。美方必须说到做到，不放空炮。\n\n美方对中国最重要的一个承诺，就是不支持\"台独\"。显然在这件事情上，美国的行径，中方并不满意。\n\n会谈当中，董军也在台湾问题上直接对奥斯汀表达了中方的坚定立场。\n\n一句是，反对向\"台独\"发出错误信号；一句是不得以任何方式\"以武助独\"。这种反对，中国绝不是说说而已。\n\n注意这次会谈时间的一个\"微妙\"之处，会谈前，中国人民解放军东部战区刚刚在台岛周边开展了\"联合利剑－2024A\"演习。\n\n对于这个演习，美方的反应是什么呢？\n\n今年以来，美媒有关\"中美军事\"\"中美两国防长\"的相关报道中，点名\"台湾\"尤其多，平均每天有4次，对演习的报道正是其中的最高峰。其中触达率最高的一篇文章来自《纽约时报》，其中提到一个细节：\n\n针对解放军明确说到的，\"此次演习是对'台独'势力分裂行径的严厉惩罚，也是对外部势力干涉和挑衅的严重警告\"，美方直接对号入座了，表示\"外部势力\"指的就是美国。\n\n\"惩罚\"和\"警告\"，也被路透社、CNN、BBC、美国之音（VOA）、哥伦比亚广播公司（CBS）等外媒放到了对这次军演报道标题的醒目位置。\n\n军事专家赵小卓告诉谭主，解放军环台演习对美军产生了一定的威慑作用。从近年来的军演看，解放军演习之际，美军部署在台海周边的舰艇一般会退后，与解放军保持一定距离，避免出现碰撞等意外事件。这背后反映的是美军在作战上力避与大国的军事冲突，有一定的防守意味。\n\n这样的考量，也反映在了美军的战略部署调整上。\n\n今年以来，美军在西太平洋地区的部署出现了一个新特点是，不断加强近台岛屿军事部署。这与此前，美军通过军舰\"过航\"台湾海峡，在西太平洋台岛以东调动航母等方式不同。\n\n这种\"距离感\"，代表了美国所谓的\"协防\"台湾的真相。而要看清这种真相，台军也是一个很好的观察样本。\n\n谭主集纳今年以来岛内关于台军的负面信息发现，军心不稳和作风问题已经成为台军的普遍现象，每天都有数十条帖文的曝光量。\n\n其中，台军给台湾地区领导人致信成了一种流行趋势。这些致信中都提到，宁赔巨款也要退军，批台湾地区领导人只会喊\"抗中保台\"激怒对岸，不考虑基层感受。\n\n这反映着\"台独\"分裂和外部势力干涉给台湾带来的安全风险，已经引发了台军内部的反感情绪。\n\n美国要纵容\"台独\"势力，试图对台海现状\"切香肠\"，走\"渐进台独\"路线，我们只会\"反切香肠\"，达到\"台独\"每挑衅一次，反制就推进一步，距离两岸完全统一就更近一步的效果。\n\n根据谭主在现场了解到的情况，本次\"香会\"，中方代表团重点希望讨论的议题，有三个，除了中美两军关系和台海问题，还有一个非常重要的议题，就是南海。\n\n就在中美防长会谈后，\"香会\"的主办方举办了欢迎晚宴。\n\n中国防长董军和新加坡前总理李显龙、会议主办方国际战略研究所执行主席奇普曼一桌。\n\n而美国防长奥斯汀则和菲律宾总统小马科斯一桌。去年以来，南海问题的波澜恰恰与菲律宾和外部势力的怂恿支持密切相关。\n\n菲律宾很清楚，在实力上与中国差距悬殊。半个月前，菲律宾方面怂恿百艘渔船侵闯我黄岩岛海域，结果，中国海警一夫当关，将菲方船只最终拦截在了距离黄岩岛海域60海里之遥的位置。面对现实，菲律宾就只能在\"叙事\"上下功夫。\n\n上一次侵闯事件之后，菲律宾方面在社交媒体上炒作的小动作依然没有停止。\n\n最近三天，境外社交舆论场就\"南海\"话题讨论尤其多，谭主梳理后制作了这样一张传播链路图。\n\n如何理解这样一张传播链路图，谭主找到了一位专业人士，合肥综合性国家科学中心汪雪松。\n\n根据他的介绍，相关内容共涉及2000多个传播节点。对这些传播节点展开分析就会发现，境外的\"南海\"话题多由菲律宾官方发起，然后菲律宾记者、网红做传播细节补充并反驳中方回应，由此来形成舆情。\n\n而菲律宾最新炒作的内容，集中在\"休渔\"。\n\n5月份，中方履行包括《联合国海洋法公约》在内的国际法义务，在南海实施伏季休渔制度，以期达到对海洋生物资源进行可持续保护的目的，结果到了菲律宾这里，变成了对菲律宾造成威胁，中国欺凌弱小。\n\n这样的炒作，美国也乐见将其延续到\"香会\"，会前，美方就不断炒作，菲律宾总统小马科斯将在本届\"香会\"发表主旨演讲，还把矛头指向中国。\n\n在\"香会\"现场，谭主也发现了一位熟悉的面孔，美国CNN记者伊万·沃森，他曾出现在菲律宾侵闯南海的船上，更是炒作中菲矛盾的惯犯。\n\n美国期待的，无非是在\"香会\"上看到中国与地区国家针锋相对的场面。\n\n只不过，中方代表团专家早早就告诉谭主，中方不是去\"香会\"吵架的。但不吵架，不意味着不斗争，人民解放军对一味加剧挑衅的行为绝不姑息，但中方也会继续通过平等协商解决分歧。\n\n因为菲律宾的炒作并不能代表地区国家尤其是东盟国家的共同意志。\n\n谭主注意到，在\"香会\"接下来几天的议程中，有\"建立亚太地区的合作安全\"等分论坛，这些论坛上少不了对南海议题的讨论。\n\n谭主集纳了东盟10国的44家智库今年以来有关南海的报告，发现\"区域\"\"地区\"\"利益\"等关键词，处于各国讨论的核心。相反，\"争端\"\"战争\"等，则处在相对边缘的位置。\n\n从军事、安全的角度去考察南海，这并不符合区域国家关注的主流。\n\n值得一提的是，如果对这些报告的结论进行提炼，有一个形容词，反映着区域国家的共同担忧：复杂化。它说的是，南海问题正变成一个复杂问题，其对周边国家造成的负面影响，已经远远超过了南海问题本身。\n\n同时，报告也提到，东盟各国虽然态度不一，但必须共同将地区稳定放在第一位。\n\n今年以来，东盟国家关于南海问题的报道量最高峰是4月12日，东盟各国主流媒体集体转发了中方对美日菲峰会的表态。\n\n面对这场试图扩大南海安全风险的所谓峰会，泰国前外交部长卡西特·皮罗米亚在接受采访时强调，东盟的共同努力是为了和平与共同繁荣，而不是别的。\n\n这句话的言外之意很明显了，《南海各方行为宣言》的核心，就是各方不推进军事化。当前南海之乱，正是菲律宾在不推进南海军事化等问题上背信弃义、挑衅滋事，甚至要引入域外国家加剧地区安全风险导致的。\n\n和平，显然才是亚洲地区和全世界的最大公约数。\n\n谭主在\"香会\"现场，看到最多的，就是穿着军装的各国军人。\n\n军人，讨论的议题可能是\"冲突\"，但中国的哲学理念是\"慎战止战\"。\n\n实际上，包括南海在内的各种问题，归根到底就是和平与冲突的选择，中国始终希望塑造的，是和平，我们希望南海是和平之海，各地区都是和平之地。\n\n这样的理念，在接下来的\"香会\"时间里，想必中国还会不厌其详地，向那些听不懂\"和平\"二字的国家持续分享。",

        "summary": "On May 31, Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun met with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin at the \"Shangri-La Dialogue\" (Shangri-La Dialogue). The meeting, initially scheduled for one hour, extended to 75 minutes, indicating the depth of discussions.\n\nKey points from the meeting include:\n\n1. **Correction of Mistakes**: Dong Jun urged the U.S. to correct its mistakes, particularly regarding military provocations and miscommunications, such as the previous year's incident where a U.S. reconnaissance plane intruded into Chinese training areas.\n\n2. **Military Communication**: The meeting was a result of resumed military exchanges following a summit between the Chinese and U.S. presidents. This resumption includes high-level communications and various military consultation mechanisms.\n\n3. **Taiwan Issue**: Dong Jun reiterated China's firm stance against \"Taiwan independence\" and warned against any form of military support for it. This was underscored by recent PLA military exercises around Taiwan, which the U.S. media closely monitored.\n\n4. **South China Sea**: The South China Sea was another significant topic, with China emphasizing its stance against external interference and provocations, particularly from the Philippines, which has been encouraged by external forces like the U.S.\n\n5. **U.S. Intentions**: The U.S. aims to understand China's positions on Taiwan and the South China Sea to guide its military deployments. The U.S. also emphasized its commitment to \"freedom of navigation\" and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\n6. **Outcomes and Implications**: While the meeting was seen as a positive step towards maintaining communication, it highlighted ongoing significant differences. The stability of U.S.-China military relations is crucial for global stability, but resolving all issues will require more than one meeting.\n\nThe discussions reflect broader geopolitical tensions, with the U.S. probing China's limits and China asserting its core interests, particularly regarding Taiwan and the South China Sea. The meeting's outcomes suggest a cautious but ongoing dialogue between the two military powers."

        "body": "5月31日，中国国防部长董军同美国国防部长在\"香会\"进行了面对面会谈。\n\n在面对面会谈中，中国国防部长董军直接敦促美方切实纠正错误，具体是哪些错误？\n\n通过会场内外的细节，我们一窥究竟。\n\n关于本次中美防长会谈的时间，谭主了解到，会谈原定时间是1个小时，而双方实际会谈的时长达到了75分钟，比原定时间延长了15分钟。\n\n中美防长能面对面坐下来，首先得益于中美元首会晤之后，中美两军交流的逐步开展。\n\n军事科学院研究员童真告诉谭主，包括两军高层沟通、中美国防部工作会晤、中美海上军事安全磋商机制会议等中美军方各层级的交流机制，都已经恢复运转。\n\n这对于中美两军关系而言，无疑是一个新的开始。但是从\"止跌\"到\"企稳\"，中美两军还有很多待解的问题。\n\n美方首先要纠正的，是交流的认知与心态。\n\n要知道在去年同一时间，美军在希望与中国军方交流的情况下，仍派出一架侦察机，蓄意闯入我训练区域实施侦察干扰，并\"反咬一口\"，污蔑中方依法依规的处置是\"不专业拦截\"，试图把脏水泼给中国。\n\n这一次，美国没有再搞出什么\"意外事件\"，甚至才刚刚做完手术的美国国防部长奥斯汀，也还是如期赴约。\n\n不仅如此，美国媒体也早早放风美国防长要与中方会面的消息。从这个细节也能看出，美国跟中方进行军事交流的意愿更加迫切。\n\n值得注意的是，这份\"迫切\"背后，美国的心态中仍然包含着猜测和试探。\n\n对今年以来美国媒体涉及中美防长会晤的报道进行主题分析后，可以发现其中既包括巴以冲突、乌克兰危机等国际和地区问题，也包括台湾、南海等涉及中方核心利益的议题。\n\n继续深入分析可以发现，美国最常强调的问题是所谓的\"航行自由\"，以及美国对印太以及台湾海峡\"和平稳定\"的承诺依然坚定。\n\n在军事科学院战争研究院研究员曹延中看来，美方所谓的保持沟通，实质关切的还是中方在台湾、南海等问题上的处置方式，要求中方注意管控一线对峙的强度。\n\n说白了就是先摸清中方底线，窥探中方行动，好指导自己的下一步\"军事力量前沿部署\"。\n\n美方与中方在交流中的目的有所不同，有分歧是自然的。\n\n在中美两军防长会谈后的中方新闻发布会上，法新社等国际媒体的记者也很关心在此背景下，会谈是否达到了中方想要的效果？\n\n用中国国防部新闻发言人吴谦的话来说，可以分两层看。\n\n第一层是，此次中美防长会谈效果是好的，双方将继续保持沟通。\n\n确实，全世界热爱和平的人，应该没有人会否认中美两军关系的稳定，有利于全世界的稳定。\n\n第二层是，中美两军之间的高层沟通和交流是非常重要的，但同时也不可能期待双方仅仅通过一次会谈就解决中美两军之间存在的所有问题。\n\n中美两军之间仍然存在很多分歧，但正像军事科学院原副院长何雷所说，面对面会谈给中方重申在重大问题上的原则立场提供了契机。美方必须说到做到，不放空炮。\n\n美方对中国最重要的一个承诺，就是不支持\"台独\"。显然在这件事情上，美国的行径，中方并不满意。\n\n会谈当中，董军也在台湾问题上直接对奥斯汀表达了中方的坚定立场。\n\n这其中有两句话，格外值得注意。\n\n一句是，反对向\"台独\"发出错误信号；一句是不得以任何方式\"以武助独\"。这种反对，中国绝不是说说而已。\n\n注意这次会谈时间的一个\"微妙\"之处，会谈前，中国人民解放军东部战区刚刚在台岛周边开展了\"联合利剑－2024A\"演习。\n\n对于这个演习，美方的反应是什么呢？\n\n今年以来，美媒有关\"中美军事\"\"中美两国防长\"的相关报道中，点名\"台湾\"尤其多，平均每天有4次，对演习的报道正是其中的最高峰。其中触达率最高的一篇文章来自《纽约时报》，其中提到一个细节：\n\n针对解放军明确说到的，\"此次演习是对'台独'势力分裂行径的严厉惩罚，也是对外部势力干涉和挑衅的严重警告\"，美方直接对号入座了，表示\"外部势力\"指的就是美国。\n\n\"惩罚\"和\"警告\"，也被路透社、CNN、BBC、美国之音（VOA）、哥伦比亚广播公司（CBS）等外媒放到了对这次军演报道标题的醒目位置。\n\n军事专家赵小卓告诉谭主，解放军环台演习对美军产生了一定的威慑作用。从近年来的军演看，解放军演习之际，美军部署在台海周边的舰艇一般会退后，与解放军保持一定距离，避免出现碰撞等意外事件。这背后反映的是美军在作战上力避与大国的军事冲突，有一定的防守意味。\n\n这样的考量，也反映在了美军的战略部署调整上。\n\n今年以来，美军在西太平洋地区的部署出现了一个新特点是，不断加强近台岛屿军事部署。这与此前，美军通过军舰\"过航\"台湾海峡，在西太平洋台岛以东调动航母等方式不同。\n\n这种\"距离感\"，代表了美国所谓的\"协防\"台湾的真相。而要看清这种真相，台军也是一个很好的观察样本。\n\n谭主集纳今年以来岛内关于台军的负面信息发现，军心不稳和作风问题已经成为台军的普遍现象，每天都有数十条帖文的曝光量。\n\n其中，台军给台湾地区领导人致信成了一种流行趋势。这些致信中都提到，宁赔巨款也要退军，批台湾地区领导人只会喊\"抗中保台\"激怒对岸，不考虑基层感受。\n\n这反映着\"台独\"分裂和外部势力干涉给台湾带来的安全风险，已经引发了台军内部的反感情绪。\n\n美国要纵容\"台独\"势力，试图对台海现状\"切香肠\"，走\"渐进台独\"路线，我们只会\"反切香肠\"，达到\"台独\"每挑衅一次，反制就推进一步，距离两岸完全统一就更近一步的效果。\n\n根据谭主在现场了解到的情况，本次\"香会\"，中方代表团重点希望讨论的议题，有三个，除了中美两军关系和台海问题，还有一个非常重要的议题，就是南海。\n\n实际上，从会场的一个细节就能看出，当前南海问题的祸根源自何处。\n\n就在中美防长会谈后，\"香会\"的主办方举办了欢迎晚宴。\n\n中国防长董军和新加坡前总理李显龙、会议主办方国际战略研究所执行主席奇普曼一桌。\n\n而美国防长奥斯汀则和菲律宾总统小马科斯一桌。去年以来，南海问题的波澜恰恰与菲律宾和外部势力的怂恿支持密切相关。\n\n菲律宾很清楚，在实力上与中国差距悬殊。半个月前，菲律宾方面怂恿百艘渔船侵闯我黄岩岛海域，结果，中国海警一夫当关，将菲方船只最终拦截在了距离黄岩岛海域60海里之遥的位置。面对现实，菲律宾就只能在\"叙事\"上下功夫。\n\n上一次侵闯事件之后，菲律宾方面在社交媒体上炒作的小动作依然没有停止。\n\n最近三天，境外社交舆论场就\"南海\"话题讨论尤其多，谭主梳理后制作了这样一张传播链路图。\n\n如何理解这样一张传播链路图，谭主找到了一位专业人士，合肥综合性国家科学中心汪雪松。\n\n根据他的介绍，相关内容共涉及2000多个传播节点。对这些传播节点展开分析就会发现，境外的\"南海\"话题多由菲律宾官方发起，然后菲律宾记者、网红做传播细节补充并反驳中方回应，由此来形成舆情。\n\n而菲律宾最新炒作的内容，集中在\"休渔\"。\n\n5月份，中方履行包括《联合国海洋法公约》在内的国际法义务，在南海实施伏季休渔制度，以期达到对海洋生物资源进行可持续保护的目的，结果到了菲律宾这里，变成了对菲律宾造成威胁，中国欺凌弱小。\n\n这样的炒作，美国也乐见将其延续到\"香会\"，会前，美方就不断炒作，菲律宾总统小马科斯将在本届\"香会\"发表主旨演讲，还把矛头指向中国。\n\n在\"香会\"现场，谭主也发现了一位熟悉的面孔，美国CNN记者伊万·沃森，他曾出现在菲律宾侵闯南海的船上，更是炒作中菲矛盾的惯犯。\n\n美国期待的，无非是在\"香会\"上看到中国与地区国家针锋相对的场面。\n\n只不过，中方代表团专家早早就告诉谭主，中方不是去\"香会\"吵架的。但不吵架，不意味着不斗争，人民解放军对一味加剧挑衅的行为绝不姑息，但中方也会继续通过平等协商解决分歧。\n\n因为菲律宾的炒作并不能代表地区国家尤其是东盟国家的共同意志。\n\n谭主注意到，在\"香会\"接下来几天的议程中，有\"建立亚太地区的合作安全\"等分论坛，这些论坛上少不了对南海议题的讨论。\n\n谭主集纳了东盟10国的44家智库今年以来有关南海的报告，发现\"区域\"\"地区\"\"利益\"等关键词，处于各国讨论的核心。相反，\"争端\"\"战争\"等，则处在相对边缘的位置。\n\n从军事、安全的角度去考察南海，这并不符合区域国家关注的主流。\n\n值得一提的是，如果对这些报告的结论进行提炼，有一个形容词，反映着区域国家的共同担忧：复杂化。它说的是，南海问题正变成一个复杂问题，其对周边国家造成的负面影响，已经远远超过了南海问题本身。\n\n同时，报告也提到，东盟各国虽然态度不一，但必须共同将地区稳定放在第一位。\n\n今年以来，东盟国家关于南海问题的报道量最高峰是4月12日，东盟各国主流媒体集体转发了中方对美日菲峰会的表态。\n\n面对这场试图扩大南海安全风险的所谓峰会，泰国前外交部长卡西特·皮罗米亚在接受采访时强调，东盟的共同努力是为了和平与共同繁荣，而不是别的。\n\n这句话的言外之意很明显了，《南海各方行为宣言》的核心，就是各方不推进军事化。当前南海之乱，正是菲律宾在不推进南海军事化等问题上背信弃义、挑衅滋事，甚至要引入域外国家加剧地区安全风险导致的。\n\n和平，显然才是亚洲地区和全世界的最大公约数。\n\n谭主在\"香会\"现场，看到最多的，就是穿着军装的各国军人。\n\n军人，讨论的议题可能是\"冲突\"，但中国的哲学理念是\"慎战止战\"。\n\n实际上，包括南海在内的各种问题，归根到底就是和平与冲突的选择，中国始终希望塑造的，是和平，我们希望南海是和平之海，各地区都是和平之地。\n\n这样的理念，在接下来的\"香会\"时间里，想必中国还会不厌其详地，向那些听不懂\"和平\"二字的国家持续分享。",

This included high-level communications and working meetings between the two defense departments.\n3. **Taiwan Issue**: Dong Jun reiterated China's firm stance against \"Taiwan independence\" and warned against any form of military support for Taiwan's independence.\n4. **South China Sea**: The discussion also covered the South China Sea, with China highlighting the disruptive role of external forces, particularly the U.S. and the Philippines.\n\nThe meeting underscored the importance of continued communication between the two militaries, despite existing differences. The U.S. expressed a strong desire for military dialogue, though it still harbors suspicions and strategic interests, particularly concerning Taiwan and the South China Sea.\n\nThe outcomes suggest a cautious but necessary step towards stabilizing U.S.-China military relations, with both sides recognizing the need for ongoing dialogue to manage disputes and avoid conflicts."

        "body": "【环球时报-环球网报道 记者 郭媛丹 李艾鑫】6月1日，在新加坡出席第21届香格里拉对话会的中国代表团举行中外媒体吹风会。中央军委联合参谋部副参谋长景建峰空军中将在谈及台湾问题时表示，我们组织军事反制行动，就是要用更强大的能力、更有力的手段、更坚定的决心，打击\"台独\"嚣张气焰，慑止外部势力干涉。解放军决不允许台湾从中国分裂出去，\"台独\"等于战争。\n\n针对6月1日上午美国国防部长奥斯汀的大会发言，中央军委联合参谋部副参谋长景建峰空军中将在当天的中国代表团吹风会上从美亚太同盟伙伴关系、中美两国两军关系，台湾问题、南海问题等方面作出回应。\n\n在谈及台湾问题时，景建峰表示，台湾自古以来就属于中国。《开罗宣言》、《波茨坦公告》、联合国大会第2758号决议等具有国际法律效力的文件，都明确了中国对台湾的主权，这也是战后国际秩序的重要组成部分。台湾问题是中美关系中最重要、最敏感的核心问题，当年中美建交的前提是断交、废约、撤军。近年来美方背弃承诺，虚化掏空一中原则，助台谋\"独\"，武装台湾，搅乱台海。当前台海形势严峻，赖清德之流数典忘祖，赤裸裸贩卖\"两国论\"，妄想\"倚外谋独\"、\"以武谋独\"，加速把台湾推向灾难深渊。这是破坏台海现状的罪魁祸首，也是地区稳定的最大危害。\n\n他表示，我们组织军事反制行动，就是要用更强大的能力、更有力的手段、更坚定的决心，打击\"台独\"嚣张气焰，慑止外部势力干涉。解放军决不允许台湾从中国分裂出去，\"台独\"等于战争。解放军练兵备战决不停歇，打\"独\"促统决不停步，挫败外来干涉决不手软，坚决完成捍卫国家主权和领土完整的使命任务。\n\n在谈及美\"印太战略\"时，景建峰表示，美国\"印太战略\"满是华丽辞藻，打着促进地区合作的旗号，但实际上却抱守冷战思维和零和博弈搞封闭排他的\"俱乐部\"，真正目的是把一个个\"小圈子\"融合成亚太版\"北约\"这个\"大圈子\"，从而维持以美国为主导的霸权地位。这个战略本质上是一个制造分裂、煽动对抗、破坏稳定的战略，完全是逆历史潮流而动，违背地区国家求和平、谋发展、促合作、图共赢的共同意愿，服务的只是美国的一己地缘政治私利，注定是没有前途的。\n\n景建峰表示，美国鼓吹的所谓伙伴关系，实际上搞的是团团伙伙的\"小圈子\"。这些\"小圈子\"均以美国利益为先。美方一贯搞\"美国优先\"，嘴上说\"支持东盟中心地位\"，行动上却在制造分裂，通过构建各种三边、四边等\"小集团\"，强化美国主导的地区格局，弱化以东盟为中心的合作架构。这些\"小圈子\"加剧地区紧张。美方强化军事存在，迫使他国选边站队，竭力推进北约东扩，这些都是从散布威胁入手，把地区国家绑上美国的战车，不断输出危机祸乱，成为亚太地区和平稳定的\"风险源\"、\"破坏者\"。\n\n\"这些'小圈子'最终得不偿失。美国人自己都说，温言在口，大棒在手。美常常以伙伴关系为小利，诱拉地区国家成为美代理人，进而诱骗其 '挡枪埋单'。不管是'西贡时刻'，还是'喀布尔大溃退'，众多美小伙伴纷纷沦为'受害国'，美方这种唯我唯利的本性暴露无遗。这让我想起，已故美国前国务卿基辛格先生的一句话，'作美国的敌人是危险的，但是作美国的盟友则是致命的。'\"景建峰表示。\n\n针对南海问题，景建峰表示，\"今天上午美方的发言，为菲站台背书，影射中方正当维权行动，完全是没有道理的。菲拉拢域外势力介入，美在南海拉偏架，美菲勾连作乱，制造对抗与危机，破坏的是地区和平稳定，损害的是地区国家共同利益，这不是大家想看到的局面。\"\n\n景建峰说，当前南海形势总体稳定，全球50％的商船、三分之一的海上贸易航经于此，美国的商船也天天在这里跑，美国的军舰还不请自到，什么时候不自由了？美方南海叙事背离事实，制造莫须有的恐慌，险恶用心不言自明。南海局势局部升温反复，其根源在于菲律宾背信弃义、侵权挑衅，美国插手搅局、拱火滋事。\n\n\"中国和东盟是搬不走的邻居，邻里间有点磕绊很正常，我们要有事多商量、有事好商量，而不能引狼入室、引火烧身。中方始终保持高度克制，坚持通过对话协商妥处分歧，但善意不允许被滥用，侵权挑衅决不能纵容，中方坚决维护自身主权和海洋权益。\"他表示。\n\n在谈及中美两军关系时，景建峰表示，中美两军关系稳定发展符合双方共同利益，也是国际社会的普遍期待。两军应落实好两国元首共识，坚持不冲突不对抗，当好两国关系的稳定基石。我们希望美方言行一致，切实坚持以和为贵、以稳为重、以信为本的原则，加强交流、推进合作，探索出一条符合双方共同利益、契合世界期盼的正确相处之道。",

He argued that the U.S. forms exclusive alliances that prioritize American interests, which increases regional tensions and undermines ASEAN's central role.\n\nRegarding the South China Sea, Jing accused the U.S. and the Philippines of creating instability and emphasized China's commitment to resolving disputes through dialogue while defending its sovereignty.\n\nOn U.S.-China military relations, Jing called for stable development based on mutual interests and international expectations, urging the U.S. to align its actions with its words to foster cooperation and stability."

Jing emphasized that Taiwan has always been part of China, citing international legal documents like the Cairo Declaration and Potsdam Proclamation. He criticized Taiwanese leader Lai Ching-te as a major threat to regional stability and reiterated that \"Taiwan independence\" equates to war, with the Chinese military prepared to counter any separatist actions.\n\nThe meeting between Chinese and U.S. defense officials did not yield satisfactory results, highlighting significant differences, especially on Taiwan. Austin expressed concerns over China's recent military actions around Taiwan and reiterated that normal democratic processes in Taiwan should not be met with coercion. Jing's firm response indicated that China would not be swayed by U.S. positions, suggesting that continued provocations by Lai could escalate tensions, potentially leading to direct conflict.\n\nDespite the disagreements, the meeting had positive outcomes, such as the establishment of emergency communication mechanisms to prevent misunderstandings and misjudgments. Austin committed to answering emergency calls and hoped for reciprocal actions from Chinese Defense Minister Li Shangfu. This development indicates a move towards stabilizing high-level military communications between the two nations, even as they navigate a competitive relationship."

        "body": "5月31日，中国国防部长董军同美国国防部长在\"香会\"进行了面对面会谈。\n\n谭主也跟着中方代表团来到了\"香会\"现场，并在现场同步开启了直播。超过1000万人次在直播中观看了谭主披露的会谈细节。\n\n在面对面会谈中，中国国防部长董军直接敦促美方切实纠正错误，具体是哪些错误？\n\n通过会场内外的细节，我们一窥究竟。\n\n关于本次中美防长会谈的时间，谭主了解到，会谈原定时间是1个小时，而双方实际会谈的时长达到了75分钟，比原定时间延长了15分钟。\n\n中美防长能面对面坐下来，首先得益于中美元首会晤之后，中美两军交流的逐步开展。\n\n军事科学院研究员童真告诉谭主，包括两军高层沟通、中美国防部工作会晤、中美海上军事安全磋商机制会议等中美军方各层级的交流机制，都已经恢复运转。\n\n这对于中美两军关系而言，无疑是一个新的开始。但是从\"止跌\"到\"企稳\"，中美两军还有很多待解的问题。\n\n美方首先要纠正的，是交流的认知与心态。\n\n要知道在去年同一时间，美军在希望与中国军方交流的情况下，仍派出一架侦察机，蓄意闯入我训练区域实施侦察干扰，并\"反咬一口\"，污蔑中方依法依规的处置是\"不专业拦截\"，试图把脏水泼给中国。\n\n这一次，美国没有再搞出什么\"意外事件\"，甚至才刚刚做完手术的美国国防部长奥斯汀，也还是如期赴约。\n\n不仅如此，美国媒体也早早放风美国防长要与中方会面的消息。从这个细节也能看出，美国跟中方进行军事交流的意愿更加迫切。\n\n值得注意的是，这份\"迫切\"背后，美国的心态中仍然包含着猜测和试探。\n\n对今年以来美国媒体涉及中美防长会晤的报道进行主题分析后，可以发现其中既包括巴以冲突、乌克兰危机等国际和地区问题，也包括台湾、南海等涉及中方核心利益的议题。\n\n继续深入分析可以发现，美国最常强调的问题是所谓的\"航行自由\"，以及美国对印太以及台湾海峡\"和平稳定\"的承诺依然坚定。\n\n在军事科学院战争研究院研究员曹延中看来，美方所谓的保持沟通，实质关切的还是中方在台湾、南海等问题上的处置方式，要求中方注意管控一线对峙的强度。\n\n说白了就是先摸清中方底线，窥探中方行动，好指导自己的下一步\"军事力量前沿部署\"。\n\n美方与中方在交流中的目的有所不同，有分歧是自然的。\n\n在中美两军防长会谈后的中方新闻发布会上，法新社等国际媒体的记者也很关心在此背景下，会谈是否达到了中方想要的效果？\n\n用中国国防部新闻发言人吴谦的话来说，可以分两层看。\n\n第一层是，此次中美防长会谈效果是好的，双方将继续保持沟通。\n\n确实，全世界热爱和平的人，应该没有人会否认中美两军关系的稳定，有利于全世界的稳定。\n\n第二层是，中美两军之间的高层沟通和交流是非常重要的，但同时也不可能期待双方仅仅通过一次会谈就解决中美两军之间存在的所有问题。\n\n中美两军之间仍然存在很多分歧，但正像军事科学院原副院长何雷所说，面对面会谈给中方重申在重大问题上的原则立场提供了契机。美方必须说到做到，不放空炮。\n\n美方对中国最重要的一个承诺，就是不支持\"台独\"。显然在这件事情上，美国的行径，中方并不满意。\n\n会谈当中，董军也在台湾问题上直接对奥斯汀表达了中方的坚定立场。\n\n这其中有两句话，格外值得注意。\n\n一句是，反对向\"台独\"发出错误信号；一句是不得以任何方式\"以武助独\"。这种反对，中国绝不是说说而已。\n\n注意这次会谈时间的一个\"微妙\"之处，会谈前，中国人民解放军东部战区刚刚在台岛周边开展了\"联合利剑－2024A\"演习。\n\n对于这个演习，美方的反应是什么呢？\n\n今年以来，美媒有关\"中美军事\"\"中美两国防长\"的相关报道中，点名\"台湾\"尤其多，平均每天有4次，对演习的报道正是其中的最高峰。这其中触达率最高的一篇文章来自《纽约时报》，其中提到一个细节：\n\n针对解放军明确说到的，\"此次演习是对'台独'势力分裂行径的严厉惩罚，也是对外部势力干涉和挑衅的严重警告\"，美方直接对号入座了，表示\"外部势力\"指的就是美国。\n\n\"惩罚\"和\"警告\"，也被路透社、CNN、BBC、美国之音（VOA）、哥伦比亚广播公司（CBS）等外媒放到了对这次军演报道标题的醒目位置。\n\n军事专家赵小卓告诉谭主，解放军环台演习对美军产生了一定的威慑作用。从近年来的军演看，解放军演习之际，美军部署在台海周边的舰艇一般会退后，与解放军保持一定距离，避免出现碰撞等意外事件。这背后反映的是美军在作战上力避与大国的军事冲突，有一定的防守意味。\n\n这样的考量，也反映在了美军的战略部署调整上。\n\n今年以来，美军在西太平洋地区的部署出现了一个新特点是，不断加强近台岛屿军事部署。这与此前，美军通过军舰\"过航\"台湾海峡，在西太平洋台岛以东调动航母等方式不同。\n\n这种\"距离感\"，代表了美国所谓的\"协防\"台湾的真相。而要看清这种真相，台军也是一个很好的观察样本。\n\n谭主集纳今年以来岛内关于台军的负面信息发现，军心不稳和作风问题已经成为台军的普遍现象，每天都有数十条帖文的曝光量。\n\n其中，台军给台湾地区领导人致信成为了一种流行趋势。这些致信中都提到，宁赔巨款也要退军，批台湾地区领导人只会喊\"抗中保台\"激怒对岸，不考虑基层感受。\n\n这反映着\"台独\"分裂和外部势力干涉给台湾带来的安全风险，已经引发了台军内部的反感情绪。\n\n美国要纵容\"台独\"势力，试图对台海现状\"切香肠\"，走\"渐进台独\"路线，我们只会\"反切香肠\"，达到\"台独\"每挑衅一次，反制就推进一步，距离两岸完全统一就更近一步的效果。\n\n根据谭主在现场了解到的情况，本次\"香会\"，中方代表团重点希望讨论的议题，有三个，除了中美两军关系和台海问题，还有一个非常重要的议题，就是南海。\n\n实际上，从会场的一个细节就能看出，当前南海问题的祸根源自何处。\n\n就在中美防长会谈后，\"香会\"的主办方举办了欢迎晚宴。\n\n中国防长董军和新加坡前总理李显龙、会议主办方国际战略研究所执行主席奇普曼一桌。\n\n而美国防长奥斯汀则和菲律宾总统小马科斯一桌。去年以来，南海问题的波澜恰恰与菲律宾和外部势力的怂恿支持密切相关。\n\n菲律宾很清楚，在实力上与中国差距悬殊。半个月前，菲律宾方面怂恿百艘渔船侵闯我黄岩岛海域，结果，中国海警一夫当关，将菲方船只最终拦截在了距离黄岩岛海域60海里之遥的位置。面对现实，菲律宾就只能在\"叙事\"上下功夫。\n\n上一次侵闯事件之后，菲律宾方面在社交媒体上炒作的小动作依然没有停止。\n\n最近三天，境外社交舆论场就\"南海\"话题讨论尤其多，谭主梳理后制作了这样一张传播链路图。\n\n如何理解这样一张传播链路图，谭主找到了一位专业人士，合肥综合性国家科学中心汪雪松。\n\n根据他的介绍，相关内容共涉及2000多个传播节点。对这些传播节点展开分析就会发现，境外的\"南海\"话题多由菲律宾官方发起，然后菲律宾记者、网红做传播细节补充并反驳中方回应，由此来形成舆情。\n\n而菲律宾最新炒作的内容，集中在\"休渔\"。\n\n5月份，中方履行包括《联合国海洋法公约》在内的国际法义务，在南海实施伏季休渔制度，以期达到对海洋生物资源进行可持续保护的目的，结果到了菲律宾这里，变成了对菲律宾造成威胁，中国欺凌弱小。\n\n这样的炒作，美国也乐见将其延续到\"香会\"，会前，美方就不断炒作，菲律宾总统小马科斯将在本届\"香会\"发表主旨演讲，还把矛头指向中国。\n\n在\"香会\"现场，谭主也发现了一位熟悉的面孔，美国CNN记者伊万·沃森，他曾出现在菲律宾侵闯南海的船上，更是炒作中菲矛盾的惯犯。\n\n美国期待的，无非是在\"香会\"上看到中国与地区国家针锋相对的场面。\n\n只不过，中方代表团专家早早就告诉谭主，中方不是去\"香会\"吵架的。但不吵架，不意味着不斗争，人民解放军对一味加剧挑衅的行为绝不姑息，但中方也会继续通过平等协商解决分歧。\n\n因为菲律宾的炒作并不能代表地区国家尤其是东盟国家的共同意志。\n\n谭主注意到，在\"香会\"接下来几天的议程中，有\"建立亚太地区的合作安全\"等分论坛，这些论坛上少不了对南海议题的讨论。\n\n谭主集纳了东盟10国的44家智库今年以来有关南海的报告，发现\"区域\"\"地区\"\"利益\"等关键词，处于各国讨论的核心。相反，\"争端\"\"战争\"等，则处在相对边缘的位置。\n\n从军事、安全的角度去考察南海，这并不符合区域国家关注的主流。\n\n值得一提的是，如果对这些报告的结论进行提炼，有一个形容词，反映着区域国家的共同担忧：复杂化。它说的是，南海问题正变成一个复杂问题，其对周边国家造成的负面影响，已经远远超过了南海问题本身。\n\n同时，报告也提到，东盟各国虽然态度不一，但必须共同将地区稳定放在第一位。\n\n今年以来，东盟国家关于南海问题的报道量最高峰是4月12日，东盟各国主流媒体集体转发了中方对美日菲峰会的表态。\n\n面对这场试图扩大南海安全风险的所谓峰会，泰国前外交部长卡西特·皮罗米亚在接受采访时强调，东盟的共同努力是为了和平与共同繁荣，而不是别的。\n\n这句话的言外之意很明显了，《南海各方行为宣言》的核心，就是各方不推进军事化。当前南海之乱，正是菲律宾在不推进南海军事化等问题上背信弃义、挑衅滋事，甚至要引入域外国家加剧地区安全风险导致的。\n\n和平，显然才是亚洲地区和全世界的最大公约数。\n\n谭主在\"香会\"现场，看到最多的，就是穿着军装的各国军人。\n\n军人，讨论的议题可能是\"冲突\"，但中国的哲学理念是\"慎战止战\"。\n\n实际上，包括南海在内的各种问题，归根到底就是和平与冲突的选择，中国始终希望塑造的，是和平，我们希望南海是和平之海，各地区都是和平之地。\n\n这样的理念，在接下来的\"香会\"时间里，想必中国还会不厌其详地，向那些听不懂\"和平\"二字的国家持续分享。",

        "summary": "On May 31, Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun met with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin at the Shangri-La Dialogue (\"Shangri-La Dialogue\"). The meeting, initially scheduled for one hour, extended to 75 minutes, reflecting the importance of the discussions.\n\nKey points from the meeting include:\n\n1. **Restoration of Military Communication**: The meeting was a result of resumed military exchanges following a summit between the Chinese and U.S. presidents. Various communication mechanisms between the two militaries have been reactivated, marking a new beginning in Sino-U.S. military relations.\n\n2. **China's Stance on Taiwan**: Dong Jun emphasized China's firm position on Taiwan, opposing any signals supporting \"Taiwan independence\" and any form of military assistance to Taiwan. This stance was underscored by recent Chinese military exercises around Taiwan, which the U.S. interpreted as a warning.\n\n3. **South China Sea Issues**: The South China Sea was another critical topic. The meeting highlighted the role of external forces, particularly the U.S. and the Philippines, in escalating tensions in the region. The U.S. has been accused of encouraging the Philippines to challenge China's territorial claims.\n\n4. **U.S. Military Posture**: The U.S. has shown a keen interest in maintaining communication with China, driven by concerns over China's actions in Taiwan and the South China Sea. The U.S. continues to stress \"freedom of navigation\" and its commitment to peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\n5. **Mutual Understanding and Differences**: While the meeting was seen as positive and a step towards continued communication, significant differences remain. The U.S. aims to understand China's bottom line on various issues to guide its military strategy, while China insists on the U.S. correcting its approach and respecting China's core interests.\n\nThe meeting's outcomes suggest a cautious but ongoing effort to stabilize Sino-U.S. military relations amidst persistent strategic and regional tensions."

        "body": "中美两轮高层交锋，在24小时内打响，中方有2句重话第一次见\n\n五月最后一天，中美先后进行了两场高级别对话。一场在新加坡，是中美两国防长时隔两年的首次面对面对话；一场安排在美国人的主场华盛顿，由我国外交部副部长马朝旭和美国副国务卿坎贝尔主持。\n\n综合各方消息来看，这两场对话，氛围都比较微妙。中美防长会议，前后只持续了一个小时多点，双方就多个问题交换意见。可想而知，绝大部分都是话不投机。\n\n至于华盛顿这边的外交磋商，情况基本相同，谈的话题也是大同小异，主要还是围绕中美关系和共同关心的地区问题交换看法。\n\n至于会谈基调，国防部这边，形容这次中美防长会是一次积极、务实，富有建设性的战略沟通；而在吹风会上，马朝旭副外长也表示，与美方的对话是坦诚、建设性的。\n\n但这些都是很常见的外交辞令，用在任何场合都显得绰绰有余。至于背后有什么深意，那就见仁见智了。\n\n可以确定的是，这两场高级别对话，传达出来的是同一个信号：哪怕消极因素有所增长，但中美关系整体而言依旧处于止跌企稳的关键阶段。继续保持互动，推动关系进一步稳定，是双方目前为数不多的共同语言，也符合国际社会的普遍期待。\n\n所以哪怕中美之间的矛盾再怎么尖锐，再怎么话不投机，该对话时还是得对话。\n\n实事求是地说，这也是中美两个大国管控分歧的唯一途径。有没有效果另说，但国际社会都乐见中美能保持沟通。对它们来说，中美对话有没有实质性的成果并不重要，关键是对话本身的象征意义。\n\n而站在我们的立场上，肯定是不希望中美互动最后沦为\"为了对话而对话\"。美国人可以敷衍了事，但中国不能。所以在沟通的同时，也要明确立场和底线，尤其是台海问题。\n\n【中美防长会谈只持续了一个小时多点】\n\n不难看到，这两场会议，我方代表不约而同在台海给美国人划下了红线，特别是马朝旭副外长这里，出现了不少以前不怎么见到的表述。\n\n在华盛顿的吹风会上，马朝旭副外长再次强调台湾问题是中美关系第一条红线的同时，还特别指出，这是两国之间\"最具燃爆点\"的问题。\n\n这似乎意味着，前段时间岛内的政局变动，台湾地区新领导人的\"台独自白\"，以及不断推动的美台勾连态势，都让我们对台海局势有了新的判断。\n\n拜登政府一边声称\"不支持'台独'\"，一边大举对台军售，还通过美国在台协会与民进党眉来眼去，各路政客隔三岔五就来窜台。种种迹象都表明，美国已不满足于在台海这边搞\"战略模糊\"，甚至要在私下里\"明牌\"。\n\n换句话说，台海已经是中美之间的\"火药桶\"了。美国嘴上虽然说要\"防止误判\"，但实际行动中却看不出有这样的意图，这种当面一套背后一套的做派，无疑加剧了风险。\n\n【香会作为多边防务平台，并非特定国家的单一主场】\n\n而谈到美国的对华政策，马朝旭副外长则表示，美国所谓的\"小院高墙\"，实际上已经成为\"大院铁幕\"。\n\n这又是一个不常见的表述。这里有必要指出，\"铁幕\"这两字，带有鲜明的冷战色彩。当年丘吉尔一番铁幕演讲，正式给冷战拉开序幕，而如今美国拉拢地区盟友，遏制、围堵中国的外交政策，隐隐然就是在中美之间制造\"新冷战\"。\n\n但中国不是苏联，在全球化的大背景下，中美关系与美苏关系也不具备可比性。但美国还是热衷于用冷战思维搞外交。没有别的原因，这是美国地缘上的舒适区，自然舍不得走出来。\n\n这一点在新加坡香格里拉对话会期间也有体现。中美防长会后，紧跟着就是香会。之前也说过，防长会只是中美防长在为香会上交锋热身。\n\n见完董军防长后，奥斯汀第二天果不其然向中国发难，试图在南海问题上给中国划线，拉拢其他国家为菲律宾撑腰。\n\n根据外媒的说法，美国已经向中国强调，《美菲共同防御条约》，对菲律宾在仁爱礁上的那条破船\"马德雷山\"号也适用。\n\n【小马科斯配合美国，渲染南海紧张局势】\n\n而前来参会的菲律宾总统小马科斯，也煞有介事地表示，要是菲律宾在南海死一个人，中菲的海上争端就接近于\"战争\"。\n\n但这种情况并未出乎预料。国防部发言人吴谦之前就说过，这次香会，中方代表团是\"任凭风浪起，稳坐钓鱼台\"，谈不上有什么压力。更何况，董军防长来新加坡出席香会，也不是冲着与美菲较劲去的。\n\n说白了，美菲对中国的陈词滥调，并不会对我们造成太多干扰。更何况，香会作为多边防务平台，谈不上是特定国家的单一主场。美菲固然是想煽动紧张局势，挑起对抗，但也要看有多少地区国家愿意买账。",

        "summary": "On the last day of May, China and the United States engaged in two high-level dialogues within 24 hours. The first meeting took place in Singapore between the defense ministers of both countries, marking their first face-to-face discussion in two years. The second meeting was held in Washington, D.C., led by Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell.\n\nBoth meetings had a delicate atmosphere and lasted just over an hour, with discussions covering various issues, primarily focusing on U.S.-China relations and regional concerns. Despite the brief duration and the challenging nature of the talks, both sides described the dialogues as constructive and candid.\n\nA significant outcome from these meetings was the reaffirmation of Taiwan as a critical issue in U.S.-China relations. Ma Zhaoxu emphasized Taiwan as the \"most explosive\" issue between the two nations, reflecting China's heightened concerns over recent developments in Taiwan and U.S. actions, including military sales and political interactions with Taiwan.\n\nAdditionally, Ma Zhaoxu criticized the U.S. policy of \"small yards, high fences,\" likening it to a \"big yard, iron curtain,\" a term reminiscent of Cold War rhetoric. This indicates China's view of U.S. efforts to contain and isolate China as a new form of Cold War strategy.\n\nThe dialogues underscore the importance of continued communication between the two powers, despite their differences, to manage tensions and maintain stability. The international community views these talks as symbolically significant, even if they do not yield immediate substantive results."

        "summary": "On May 31, during a press briefing at the 21st Shangri-La Dialogue, former Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Military Sciences, Lieutenant General He Lei, raised four questions in response to the Philippines' statements regarding the South China Sea.\n\n1. **Violation of Rules**: He Lei questioned who is actually violating international rules, arguing that the Philippines' submission of the South China Sea dispute to an international arbitration tribunal itself violated the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea and infringed on China's rights under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\n\n2. **Provocation**: He noted that disputes in the South China Sea, particularly between China and the Philippines, were relatively stable under the previous Philippine administration. However, tensions have escalated under the current Philippine government, suggesting that the Philippines is provoking conflicts.\n\n3. **Forming Alliances Outside ASEAN**: He Lei criticized the Philippines for forming military alliances with the US, Japan, and Australia, and conducting joint military exercises, which he argued undermines ASEAN's centrality and violates the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea.\n\n4. **Resolution of Disputes**: He emphasized that the resolution of South China Sea disputes and the maintenance of peace should be managed by regional countries and ASEAN, not by external powers, which he accused of instigating and exacerbating the issues.\n\nThe press briefing highlighted China's stance against external interference and its call for regional solutions to the South China Sea disputes."

        "summary": "The article discusses the recent visit of U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo to the Philippines, where she led a high-level trade and investment delegation. This visit comes amid ongoing South China Sea territorial disputes between China and the Philippines. Raimondo announced over $1 billion in investments from 22 U.S. companies, including Microsoft, Google, and United Airlines, which will create thousands of jobs and boost sectors like cybersecurity, AI, and tourism in the Philippines.\n\nThe visit aligns with the U.S. strategy to support its allies in the Indo-Pacific region, including Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines, against Chinese expansion. The Philippines, under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., has shifted from the previous administration's pro-China stance to seeking stronger ties with the U.S. and other allies. This shift was accelerated by aggressive actions from China, such as using laser beams against Philippine vessels in the South China Sea.\n\nIn response to China's economic and military pressure, the Philippines has sought investments and security agreements with other countries, including Japan, South Korea, and India. The U.S., Japan, and the Philippines have also launched the \"Luzon Economic Corridor\" initiative to counter China's Belt and Road Initiative, focusing on infrastructure and economic development.\n\nThe article highlights the broader geopolitical implications of these developments, emphasizing the need for the Philippines to diversify its economic partnerships and strengthen its alliances to mitigate the risks posed by China's assertive actions in the region."
