Analysts from the U.S. and Europe agree that NATO faces a difficult period, particularly due to its current proxy conflict with Russia over Ukraine. The article outlines several key points:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. **Historical Context**: NATO's success during the Cold War was attributed to deterrence and caution, avoiding direct conflict with the Soviet Union. Post-Cold War, NATO's expansion and efforts to roll back Russian influence have led to increased tensions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. **Current Challenges**: The war in Ukraine has intensified NATO's focus on collective defense, but it also risks direct conflict with Russia, potentially leading to nuclear war. Analysts predict continued hostility between Russia and the West, with potential flashpoints like Belarus and Kaliningrad.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. **European Rearmament**: European NATO members are expected to rearm, especially if U.S. commitment wavers, but economic constraints and resistance to pooling military resources pose challenges. NATO may also seek a global role to contain China.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4. **Internal Tensions**: If the U.S. reduces its involvement, NATO might limit its expansion and focus on defending existing members, leading to policy disagreements among members regarding Russia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5. **Neglected Issues**: The war in Ukraine has overshadowed other threats like climate change and instability in regions south of NATO, which could become more pressing in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e6. **Strategic Autonomy**: Analysts suggest that Europe should develop its own defense capabilities to reduce reliance on the U.S., potentially through initiatives like Germany's Sky Shield for air defense.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e7. **Future Scenarios**: NATO's future could involve a more balanced burden-sharing between the U.S. and Europe, or it could face internal divisions and a shift in focus towards global challenges like China.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e8. **Diplomatic Efforts**: A potential armistice in Ukraine could involve NATO and Russia setting limitations on military deployments, with Europe taking a larger role in its own defense.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e9. **Institutional Evolution**: NATO may need to adapt by focusing on regional security and addressing non-military threats like migration and climate change, rather than expanding its global reach.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOverall, the article emphasizes the need for NATO to balance its traditional defense role with new strategic challenges, while fostering greater European autonomy in defense matters."],["Economists and business leaders in Bangladesh are urging the government to delay the country's graduation from Least Developed Country (LDC) status, scheduled for 2026, due to inflated export figures.

This rejection follows six elections over the past three years, all resulting in unstable coalitions. GERB, which finished first in the June elections, holds only 68 of the 240 seats in the National Assembly. The party's leader, Boyko Borissov, who led three previous governments, opted not to become prime minister again, but his efforts to form a coalition failed.

This request followed the withdrawal of support from the ruling coalition partner, CPN-UML, after Deuba and CPN-UML Chairman K P Sharma Oli reached a power-sharing agreement. The deal involves rotating the Prime Ministerial position between the two parties for the remaining term of Parliament. The CPN-UML, which joined Prachanda's government in March, has now pulled out, with its ministers resigning. The combined strength of NC and CPN-UML in the House of Representatives is sufficient for a majority. Despite the pressure, Prachanda has refused to resign and will seek a vote of confidence in Parliament. This political instability highlights the fragile nature of Nepal's political system, which has seen 13 governments in 16 years."],["China is the leading country in generative AI patent applications, significantly outpacing the United States, according to a report by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) released on July 3. Over the past decade, China has filed over 38,200 patents related to generative AI, compared to nearly 6,300 by the U.S. The report highlights the rapid growth of generative AI, which has been linked to around 54,000 inventions from 2014 to 2023, with a notable surge in 2022. Generative AI technologies, such as ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Baidu's Ernie, are used across various industries but raise concerns about job displacement and intellectual property rights.

Concerns about Biden's age and mental fitness have been amplified, with some Democrats like Rep. Lloyd Doggett openly calling for his withdrawal. Others, including Rep. Jamie Raskin and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, express worries about Biden's ability to defeat Donald Trump and the potential negative impact on down-ballot races. Despite these concerns, senior Democratic leaders like House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer continue to publicly support Biden. The debate has introduced uncertainty into the election, with some Democrats suggesting Biden needs to demonstrate his readiness for another term through more public engagements and interviews.

Balancing these internal conflicts will be a significant challenge during her potential second term.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. **Political Shifts**: The European political landscape is shifting towards the right, with increased conservatism. While there is consensus on anti-immigration policies, there are differences on economic, climate, and defense policies. The EU's approach to China and Russia is expected to be more pragmatic and less ideologically driven.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4. **Leadership Negotiations**: Despite the rise of the far-right, von der Leyen's re-election is supported by major EU leaders.

The survey, conducted by Mono Research, included the top 1,000 companies in twelve key export industries. Notably, the shipbuilding, petrochemical, biopharmaceutical, automotive parts, and electrical electronics sectors are optimistic about export growth. Conversely, the steel and petroleum products sectors anticipate a decline.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe primary reasons for expected export growth include improved industry conditions and enhanced product competitiveness through new technologies.
